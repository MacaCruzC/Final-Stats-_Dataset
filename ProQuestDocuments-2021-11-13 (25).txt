Texto completo: Readers praise Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar for withdrawing and discuss the possibility of a brokered convention.
To the Editor:
Re "Democratic Race Resets as Biden Rides a Victory and Buttigieg Falls Out" (front page, March 2):
Kudos to Mayor Pete. He has amazing talents, as everyone has seen, and his future is even brighter than it would have been had he waited until after Super Tuesday to graciously step aside.
He was willing to accept (as some others have yet to accept) that remaining in the race could take votes from candidates who have a viable path to nomination. In this year, when the stakes are higher than any presidential election in my lifetime of 60-plus years, that is truly a valuable gift to our nation.

Re "Amy Klobuchar Drops Out of Presidential Race and Plans to Endorse Biden" (nytimes.com, March 2):
There was no other choice for Senator Amy Klobuchar except to drop out of the Democratic race. She did the right thing after running an admirable race. She conducted herself masterfully at the debates, showing calm, respect toward other candidates and knowledge. I salute her. She won my heart and my deep respect.
She is a jewel in the Democratic Party. It should not lose her talent. She would make an excellent vice president. This will prepare her to run for the presidency when the next opportunity arises.

To the Editor:
After the South Carolina Democratic primary, only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have any kind of shot at a first-ballot nomination, but the favorite is "none of the above."
Democratic voters and candidates ignore historical examples of contested conventions at their peril. Consider, for example, the 1924 Democratic convention. After sweltering and shouting at one another for two weeks and 103 ballots, delegates bypassed the favorites and nominated John W. Davis, who was clobbered in the general election by Calvin Coolidge.
Superdelegates likely would avoid a replay of the 1924 convention this year. But a contested convention whose result is determined by the superdelegates will likely hurt the eventual nominee's chances in the general election, not to mention down-ballot Democratic candidates. The Democratic presidential candidates with no realistic chance of gaining the nomination should step aside now for the good of the country, as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and others have done.

To the Editor:
I have only recently become aware of the implications of the requirement in Democratic state primaries that candidates must get 15 percent of the vote in order to win delegates. If a person votes for a candidate who does not reach this 15 percent threshold, that vote is, in effect, lost.
Those voters wanting to prevent Bernie Sanders from getting a majority of delegates nationwide should vote for a candidate with a strong chance of passing this threshold, even if this candidate is not one's first choice.

To the Editor:
Re "Key Democrats Willing to Open Party to Bruises to Stop Sanders" (front page, Feb. 28):
Amen to the "steady stream of calls to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio," hoping he will be nominated by a divided convention. When I am asked whom I support in Ohio's primary on March 17, I can only say I am still mourning Mr. Brown's decision not to enter the race.
What the Democrats need is a second ballot when party leaders and unbound delegates will fight out the choice of an electable candidate, who might be a "dark horse" like Senator Brown. After all, until the age of television, convention battles were not unusual for choosing many candidates, including Abraham Lincoln.

That digital textbook? Your college has billed you for it

Texto completo: Colleges are increasingly assigning digital books and study tools instead of paper textbooks. But one electronic option in particular has come under criticism from some student advocates.
That model is called inclusive access, in which colleges have contracts with education publishers to provide required digital texts and study tools at a discount.
Then, colleges automatically bill students when they enroll, as part of their tuition. Colleges began adopting these digital programs over the past decade in response to expensive increases in textbook prices.
Now, courses at hundreds of colleges offer inclusive access programs.
The benefit, publishers say, is that all students are able to use required textbooks and tools when they begin taking a class, at a more affordable cost. Research by both student advocates and campus bookstores has shown that students sometimes skip buying required materials - often because of cost, but also because they think they won't actually need the materials.
Federal rules allow colleges to automatically bill students for course materials if the colleges meet certain requirements, like an agreement with a publisher to charge below-market prices or give students the choice to opt out of the purchase.
But skeptical student advocates say the benefits of some programs can be murky.
Discounts can be hard to quantify because the original price of the materials is unclear, according to a report released last week by the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, an advocacy group, which examined dozens of contracts between publishers and more than 30 two- and four-year public colleges.
Also, some contracts allow publishers to reduce the discounts if too few students participate. In some cases, quotas to maintain lower pricing are as high as 90% of students taking a course.
"The idea of discounts sounds good on its face, but the contracts aren't living up to the hype," said Kaitlyn Vitez, higher education campaign director for the education fund and the author of the report.
Further, the report found, it's not always obvious how students can opt out of the billing if they want to search elsewhere.
"Students should always have a choice of how to pay," said Nick Sengstaken, a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is a member of the student government and an advocate for textbook affordability.
Pearson, the dominant education publisher in the United States, has inclusive access agreements with about 900 institutions, said Nik Osborne, the company's senior vice president of strategy and business operations.
Not all courses offer the option. Typically, a professor or department elects to participate for a specific class, he said. Students must be allowed to opt out, he said, but relatively few do because the cost is low.
The company recently announced plans to shift away from traditional textbooks toward more affordable digital options. Students can buy an electronic textbook for about $40, and a package that includes extra digital tools for about $60 to $80.
Students in the company's inclusive access program pay less. The cost can be up to 70% cheaper than what a student would pay for a new textbook, Pearson says.
"We believe strongly that digital is a better experience for students," Osborne said, but print options remain available for students who want them. Pearson rents hard-copy textbooks for about $60 apiece.
Osborne and a spokeswoman for two other big education publishers, McGraw-Hill and Cengage, stressed that colleges and universities billed their students for inclusive access programs and that it was up to them to clearly communicate steps for opting out.

Bernie Sanders won Minnesota's 2016 Democratic primary. He might win again with Amy Klobuchar's exit from the race

Resumen: With Amy Klobuchar out of the Democratic primary field, Bernie Sanders emerges as frontrunner to win Minnesota on Super Tuesday.

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her campaign for president Monday, less than 24 hours before 14 states — including her own Minnesota — hold their primaries on Super Tuesday.
On Monday night in Dallas, Klobuchar endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden, urging fellow Democrats to vote for "decency" and "dignity. "
"I think Sen. Klobuchar had a great run," said Larry Jacobs, political science professor and department head at the University of Minnesota.
He said Klobuchar had a small staff compared to "monster"-sized campaigns like that of Mike Bloomberg, and she didn't have much money behind her. Going forward, Jacobs said he expects her to play more of a leadership role in the U. S. Senate.
After she finished sixth in Saturday's South Carolina primary, Jacobs said he thinks "it began to dawn on her that she had no chance. "
Steven Schier, a professor of political science at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, said that was likely a factor, and dropping out ahead of Super Tuesday puts her in the good graces of Biden and other established Democrats.
"She's generated a lot of goodwill across the Democratic Party by doing this at a critical moment, when a lot of established Democrats are unifying around Biden," Schier said.
Schier said Klobuchar is young compared to the field of remaining candidates and is leaving the race with friends on her side.
"I think that Amy Klobuchar is tactically very shrewd and very ambitious, and by acting today, she produced a lot of opportunities for the future that she may not have had by waiting a day or two, and I think she knows that," Schier said.
But Jacobs said the door is now open for another candidate — already expected to show well in Minnesota after his performance in 2016 — to get the lion's share of delegates. Four years ago, Sanders won 61. 6% of the vote against Hillary Clinton the state's caucuses.
"Bernie Sanders is now going to do pretty well in Minnesota," Jacobs said, a sentiment echoed by Schier.

Voters who already turned in absentee ballots are stuck with their vote. The deadline to pull them back was a week ago, long before Klobuchar announced the end of her presidential campaign. Though he did not specifically mention Klobuchar, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon confirmed this in a tweet posted shortly after the announcement.
"The votes are wasted, and I feel bad for those people," Jacobs said.
You could see her breath when Klobuchar announced her run for president amid falling snow in Minneapolis on Feb. 10, 2019.
Since then, her campaign hit some highs, including a split endorsement from the New York Times with Elizabeth Warren. Klobuchar also finished third in the New Hampshire primary.
But she finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses and sixth in South Carolina, and Klobuchar's campaign canceled a rally Sunday night after Black Lives Matter protesters took over the stage in St. Louis Park.
Klobuchar is Minnesota's first female senator and has served in the U. S. Senate since 2007.
"She built a coalition that brought people together and stood up for decency in our politics," Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Monday. "Amy — you made Minnesota proud. "

Women describe the lowest points in Silicon Valley

Texto completo: I don't remember when I learned that you're supposed to hold your keys between your knuckles when you walk to your car at night. Every adult woman I've met knows this. It doesn't matter where you're from, who your parents are, where you went to school. We all just osmotically absorb the awareness that vigilance is compulsory and vulnerability is inevitable. I don't know what men do when they're not training to be parking-lot Wolverines. Maybe they just relax? Sounds like a dream.
Susan Fowler famously resigned from Uber after the "very, very strange year" she documented in a viral blog post detailing rampant sexual harassment, abuse and general lawlessness at the ride-hail behemoth. Her memoir, "Whistleblower," is a methodical and earnest retelling of one woman's effort to go to school and do her job in environments that were actively hostile to her existence and well-being.
"Whistleblower" comes out just a month after Anna Wiener's memoir, "Uncanny Valley." Wiener, now a New Yorker contributor, worked at a big data start-up in San Francisco during the tech-frenzied 2010s. Her book is wry, astute, delicious and occasionally brutal. Wiener takes readers through her realization that she's had a small part in normalizing the invasive surveillance of consumers that will soon become commonplace. Thrumming through Wiener's narrative is the theme that dominated Fowler's experience. "Sexism, misogyny, and objectification did not define the workplace - but they were everywhere," Wiener writes. "Like wallpaper, like air."
Fowler wound up at Uber because she was fleeing her "openly, unabashedly sexist" boss at PubNub, and she'd started working at PubNub because before that, at Plaid, she was pulling 14-hour days and getting paid $50,000 less than her male co-workers. Before taking a job interview with Uber, Fowler "spent a lot of time searching online for things like 'Uber sexual harassment,' 'Uber discrimination,' and 'Uber work culture,' determined to avoid a repeat of my past experiences." But nothing bad came up. She later learned why: Uber employees were silenced by forced arbitration clauses. On her first day, she was propositioned by her boss.
With the practiced ease of a dancer who knows the choreography in her bones, Fowler enacted a routine that "was almost second nature to me at this point . . . take a screenshot, email it to myself, share it with someone else for safekeeping, back it up to several cloud services, print off a hard copy, repeat."
Wiener was also familiar with this routine. "Women kept personal incident logs," she writes. "They kept spreadsheets. They kept tabs." They all had stories, from "the woman who had been slipped GHB by a friend of her CEO" to the woman who was "raped by a '10X' engineer, then pushed out of the company after reporting to HR."
There were popular strategies for managing sexism at work, Wiener learned. Some women "educate and course-correct." Others "scare and shame their colleagues for unabashed sexism." These coping mechanisms, such as they are, feel as flimsy and pathetic as keys jammed between clammy fingers.
Fowler was raised in rural Arizona in extreme poverty; at times her family went without electricity or running water. Home-schooled by religious parents, she got into tech only after her pursuits of her first two academic passions - physics and philosophy - were thwarted by institutional failures that still seem to bewilder her. As she faced ever-escalating gendered harassment in Silicon Valley, she writes, "the thought that such treatment might follow me, no matter how high up the socioeconomic ladder I climbed, absolutely terrified me."

Wiener, meanwhile, found herself "privileged and downwardly mobile" after graduating from college debt-free and landing a job in publishing in New York, where she earned a pittance only tenable because her "generous, forgiving parents" could subsidize her salary. She high-tailed it to San Francisco with the aspirational-for-a-millennial goal of affording her own health insurance; she had only one year left on her parents' plan. Assessing her New York life, she writes: "The situation was not sustainable. I was not sustainable."
But Silicon Valley brought a different existential dilemma about what one can and should sustain. Wiener wrestled with whether "to bring up the running list of casual hostilities toward women" she felt it necessary to document at the thriving start-up where she worked. "Compared to other women I'd met, I had it good. But the bar was so, so low."
As for Fowler, her surreal, harrowing experiences at Uber only intensified. She could not escape her sexist bosses; the worst offenders intentionally gave women poor performance reviews to prevent them from transferring. "The power dynamics within the company seemed sociopathic," Fowler writes. "Whenever something bad happened - like sexual harassment, verbal abuse, or another form of bullying - instead of the problem being addressed and fixed, it was covered up. Left to seethe and rot, the toxic behavior slowly infected the rest of the company. It was like a disease."
Fowler believed it would upend her life to speak publicly about Uber. She was right. She writes that she was stalked by private investigators, who also hounded her friends and family.
"Several people warned me that my life was in danger. 'I wouldn't be surprised if they have you killed,' one famous person in the tech industry said." The only "morbid thought" that gave Fowler comfort was knowing that, should she be murdered, "everyone would know exactly who was responsible."
One recurring motif in "Uncanny Valley" is that people in the start-up scene remind Wiener of children. Commuters to the campuses of search engine and social media titans wear ID badges "clipped to their belt loops or draped on top of their jackets, like children trying not to get lost in a mall." At the weekly all-hands meeting, staffers converge, "flanking the CEO in a semicircle like children at a progressive kindergarten." An account manager whispers "as though we were colluding, as though we were five years old."
When pointing this out, her tone is sometimes one of maternal warmth, even wonder. Other times, she seems dumbstruck that the people building our collective future - a boundaryless dystopia where civilians have no privacy while tech giants sway elections, avert accountability and skip out on paying taxes - are nothing more than enterprising, self-aggrandizing boys.
All the women in tech, Wiener writes, had been told by these male power players "that diversity initiatives were discriminatory against white men, that there were more men in engineering because men were innately more talented." The dark humor in that line sharpens when read in concert with "Whistleblower," in which Fowler describes supplementing her rigorous graduate courses at Penn with hours of research on string theory and theoretical particle physics. The idea that hers was the intellectual horsepower Uber could do without, while predatory men needed to be protected at all costs, would be genuinely hilarious if the consequences weren't so devastating.
As Gamergate-style harassment flourishes, conspiracies metastasize and algorithms push us all to the extremes, one can only imagine the alternate reality in which Fowler and her ilk were the ones hailed as geniuses and given all the money in this world to build a better one. Instead their days were (and are) monopolized by insanity-inducing activities, such as trying to figure out how to report HR to HR.
Meanwhile, a nationwide "techlash" is underway. As the New York Times reports, a younger generation of engineers and innovators are sizing up what would be asked of them should they join these Silicon Valley stalwarts - complicity in the family-separation efforts of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, say, or the steady erosion of democracy - and are opting out.
Fowler is now a tech editor at the New York Times. Since leaving Uber in 2016, she hasn't written a single line of code.

Texto completo: How long have U.S. troops been in Afghanistan? So long, apparently, that even the New York Times sometimes forgets why they went in the first place.
A front-page news story in the paper's Feb. 28 edition reports that the conflict started "as an act of vengeance by the United States in 2001."
"Vengeance" for what? The Times story didn't say - though the United States acted in justified response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the paper's own hometown (and on the Pentagon), which left more than 3,000 people dead.
The invasion began Oct. 7, 2001, duly authorized by Congress, and backed by allies such as Canada, Australia, Britain, France and Afghan militias. Its goal was to root out the al-Qaeda terrorists responsible for 9/11 and topple the Taliban Islamist fundamentalist dictatorship that sheltered them.
Long, long after those valid, finite objectives had been won - no small accomplishment - the United States and NATO allies remained, pursuing a more elusive project: a sustainable, reasonably democratic, pro-Western government in Kabul.
That effort has cost hundreds of billions of dollars and tens of thousands of lives - both American and (mostly) Afghan. Yet the U.S.-backed government controls only a third of the country and 46 percent of the population, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, with the rest either contested or under Taliban rule.
It is understandable that many Americans have lost track of what this more than 18-year-old war is, or was, about. Forty-five percent of us say the United States made the right decision by going into Afghanistan and 39 percent say it was wrong to do so, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center poll.
And it is therefore understandable that President Trump would pursue a negotiated exit for the roughly 13,000 U.S. military personnel who remain. Any president would be tempted to try.
As far back as 2009, a top adviser to then-President Barack Obama urged him to slash what was at the time a 30,000-troop U.S. contingent, abandoning the goal of protecting Afghan civilians from the Taliban in favor of more limited drone strikes, special forces missions and bombing raids against al-Qaeda.
The top adviser? Vice President Joe Biden. We'll never know what would have happened if Obama had adopted the Biden plan, just as we'll never know what would have happened if President George W. Bush had decided to exit Afghanistan in 2002 after dealing what was, in hindsight, a permanently crippling blow to al-Qaeda - or if he had remained focused on Afghanistan rather than opening a costly new war with Iraq.
What we do know is that the strategy Obama adopted, a counterinsurgency campaign led by 100,000 troops, yielded mixed results.
And here we are. Trump's approach - a U.S. pullout over the next 14 months in return for Taliban promises to shun terrorists and talk power-sharing with Kabul, with the United States reserving the right to hit terrorists - bears a passing resemblance to Plan Biden.
Also striking is its similarity to President Richard M. Nixon's 1973 Paris Peace Accords, which got the United States out of Vietnam.
Just as Trump struck his Taliban deal with little input from Kabul, Nixon negotiated with North Vietnam over the heads of our allies in South Vietnam. Then, as now, the president's goal was a politically beneficial way out of an "endless war" inherited from predecessors - not a long-term stabilization plan.
Fighting between North and South Vietnam paused but never really ended until April 30, 1975, when the North's troops conquered Saigon; the United States, politically exhausted and distracted by Watergate, did nothing to stop them.
In Afghanistan, there are already reports of resumed Taliban attacks after a confidence-building week of violence "reduction" ended Saturday.
President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul is balking at the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners; the Taliban considers this part of its deal with Trump, but it's one of Ghani's few bargaining chips.
Though we must hope for the best, chances are Trump's deal won't prove more workable than the Paris Peace Accords. Afghan allies, including girls and women who enjoyed a measure of human rights in areas liberated from the Taliban, are at risk.
Yet war isn't "working," either. In December 1989, Spy, a brilliant but now defunct humor magazine, published a tournament-style bracket depicting historical conflicts as if they were NCAA basketball contests.
"The World Championship," as Spy titled it, had Vietnam over the United States in one semifinal, in "overtime." In the other, Afghanistan, which had previously beaten Britain, also in "overtime" (between 1838 and 1878), defeated the Soviet Union.
Spy pitted Vietnam against Afghanistan in the finals, but left a question mark in the space marked "Champs."
Thirty-one years later, that satire has lost none of its relevance, or its sting.

Texto completo: Father Ernesto Cardenal, a Nicaraguan poet, priest and political revolutionary who wielded his pen as a weapon against two autocratic regimes - the Somoza family dynasty and the left-wing Sandinista party that took its place - died March 1 in Managua, Nicaragua's capital. He was 95.
His personal assistant, Luz Marina Acosta, confirmed the death to the Associated Press. Father Cardenal had recently been hospitalized for respiratory problems. In a sign of his renown in Nicaragua, the government of Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega ordered three days of national mourning, despite having persecuted Father Cardenal after he resigned from the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) in the early 1990s.
For many Nicaraguans, Father Cardenal was revered as a literary beacon and a moral authority, a Catholic priest who drew on Marx as well as the Gospels to champion social justice in his ministry and writings.
One of Latin America's most acclaimed poets, he wrote verses that offered a cosmic fusion of spirituality, politics, science and history, while appearing at frequent lectures and readings that made him a kind of international ambassador for Nicaragua.
Father Cardenal drew few boundaries between his callings. The son of a wealthy Nicaraguan family, he fought with a revolutionary group in his late 20s, then emerged as a leading proponent of liberation theology, which emphasizes Jesus's message to the poor and oppressed.
With a thick beard and trademark black beret, he served Mass to Sandinista revolutionaries in the jungle, later joining Ortega when those forces marched into Managua in 1979 and toppled the Somoza family, whose rule had lasted more than 40 years.
Declaring that "the triumph of the revolution is the triumph of poetry," he went on to work for nearly a decade as Nicaragua's minister of culture, angering the Vatican with his mix of politics and religion while aiming to teach tens of thousands of Nicaraguans how to read and write.
Father Cardenal traced his religious convictions to the years he spent at a Trappist monastery in Kentucky, where he befriended Thomas Merton, the distinguished writer and priest. He later completed his religious training in Mexico, Colombia and Nicaragua, where he was ordained in 1965 and settled on the Solentiname Islands in Lake Nicaragua.
He had originally intended to establish a parish church. But Father Cardenal, a sculptor as well as a writer, instead presided over a sprawling art colony, turning Solentiname into a haven for painters and spiritual seekers alike. On Sundays, he led the islanders in discussions of Christianity, eventually recording their conversations and adapting the dialogues into a multivolume work, "The Gospel in Solentiname" (1975), considered a touchstone of liberation theology.
"As the peasants of Solentiname got deeper and deeper into the Gospel," Father Cardenal wrote in the book, "they could not help but feel united to their brother and sister peasants who were suffering persecution and terror. . . . For this solidarity to be real they had to lay security, and life, on the line."
Some of the islanders joined the Sandinistas, organizing in a 1977 raid against Anastasio Somoza Debayle's forces with the blessing of Father Cardenal. The government responded by destroying the Solentiname chapel and other buildings, and Father Cardenal was labeled the "No. 1 enemy of the people."
He later served in the Sandinista cabinet alongside his brother, education minister and fellow Catholic priest Fernando Cardenal, who died in 2016. Both men defied Pope John Paul II's order to quit their government jobs and focus on their ministries, and during a 1983 visit to Managua the pope publicly reprimanded Father Cardenal, reportedly telling him to "straighten out your position with the church."
The next year, Father Cardenal was suspended from the priesthood, setting off a break with the church that was repaired only last year, when he was absolved by Pope Francis. By then, Father Cardenal had become an outspoken critic of Ortega, whose party had stifled a rebellion from a CIA-backed army known as the contras and was accused of rampant corruption and human rights abuses.
His split from the Sandinistas was "perhaps his most important political legacy," said Manuel Orozco, a Nicaragua scholar with the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. The party had "refused to recognize the atrocities committed in the 1980s," Orozco said in an email, and transformed "into a typical Latin American clientelistic and populist party." After Ortega returned to power in 2007, he added, Father Cardenal "was politically persecuted by the government, publicly attacked by the regime and even legally prosecuted on false charges."
"It was a beautiful revolution. But what happened is that it was betrayed," Father Cardenal told the Agence France-Presse in 2015, recalling his turn away from the Sandinistas. "There is now the family dictatorship of Daniel Ortega. That's not what we fought for."
Ernesto Cardenal Martínez was born in Granada, on the shores of Lake Nicaragua, on Jan. 20, 1925. After graduating from a Jesuit high school, he studied literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and at Columbia University in Manhattan, where he immersed himself in American poetry.
"From Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore he borrowed the belief that poetry is a public language of precise documentary facts that he called 'exteriorismo,' " said Northwestern professor Harris Feinsod, author of "The Poetry of the Americas: From Good Neighbors to Countercultures."
"At the same time, from Latin American poets like Rubén Darío and Pablo Neruda, he took the belief that poetry could be a vehicle for Latin American nations to craft independent political visions," Feinsod added by email. Poems such as "Zero Hour" and "With Walker in Nicaragua" recalled the history of U.S. imperialism through figures such as Sam Zemurray, the head of United Fruit Company, and William Walker, who conquered Nicaragua in the mid-1850s.
Father Cardenal also spoke out against the Somoza regime in his verse, skirting government censorship by publishing outside the country as an "Anonymous Nicaraguan." His later works increasingly incorporated scientific themes, notably in "Cosmic Canticle" (1989), a 500-page poem that drew on the theories of physicists such as Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking.
"Science brings me close to God because it describes the universe and creation, and that brings me close to the creator," he told the New York Times in 2015. "For me this is a prayer."
Father Cardenal leaves no immediate survivors, according to local news reports. In recent years he led a Granada cultural center, the Casa de los Tres Mundos, and received literary honors including Chile's Pablo Neruda Ibero-American Poetry Award and Spain's Reina Sofia poetry prize.
In interviews, Father Cardenal declared that Jesus had led him to Marx, once calling himself "a revolutionary for the sake of His kingdom."
"The Bible is full of revolutions," he said at a public reading in 2014. "The prophets are people with a message of revolution. Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come."

Texto completo: James Lipton, who had a multifaceted career in entertainment as a soap opera writer, Broadway lyricist and producer-director of star-studded TV spectacles, but who became best known as the discreetly probing host of the Bravo TV show "Inside the Actors Studio," died March 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 93.
The cause was bladder cancer, said his wife, Kedakai Lipton.
Mr. Lipton entered show business in the 1950s as a young writer and actor brimming with ambition. For years he struggled to find his place in the industry, laboring over soap opera scripts - he sometimes worked on three shows at once - and weathering two flops when he tried to break into mainstream musical theater as a lyricist and librettist in the 1960s.
He eventually became an impresario behind television specials featuring comedian Bob Hope as well as made-for-TV galas honoring the arts and American history. He was head writer from 1982 to 1987 of the TV soap opera "Capitol," set in and around Washington, and continued to pour out television films, one based on his novel "Mirrors," about ballet hopefuls in the competitive world of New York dance. It featured echoes of his own professional life.
"I'm not that fond of everything that's been written or filmed about dance," Mr. Lipton told the New York Times. "They're essentially variations on '42d Street.' The star is hurt, the understudy goes on and a new star is born. More interesting to me are all those dancers to whom that never happens."
Although he had spent the great part of his career toiling in genres that rarely attract critical esteem, Mr. Lipton was invited in the early 1990s to join the board of the Actors Studio workshop, a vaunted organization established in 1947 by Elia Kazan, Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford to train actors, directors and writers. For decades its operations had been dominated by artistic director Lee Strasberg, who died in 1982.
Mr. Lipton found the studio's finances in grave condition and proposed a master's-level drama program - initially as a partnership with the New School in Manhattan and later with Pace University - to generate income.
The MFA program, launched 1993 with Mr. Lipton as dean, proved a near-instant success. The next year, he created "Inside the Actors Studio" for Bravo to increase the program's name recognition.
The show featured an A-list roster of Hollywood and Broadway royalty, including Paul Newman, Barbra Streisand, Robin Williams, Spike Lee and Steven Spielberg. In exchange for their appearance, Mr. Lipton provided a relatively safe space for sometimes guarded celebrities to reveal themselves more personally before a live audience.
Mr. Lipton used large blue index cards, with notes and questions based on his voluminous research about his interviewees, to guide their conversations. He was inquisitive but not tabloid-minded, shunning uncomfortable questions.

Perhaps because of his own experience, he never lingered on projects that were critical or commercial failures. Instead, he called upon his deep knowledge of stagecraft and the entertainment industry to discuss his guests' philosophies toward their lives and work.
"It is not journalism," Mr. Lipton told the Times. "It is meant as an antidote to what is normally done with these people. I want to create an environment where people are willing to talk about the craft, not about themselves as people but as artists."
Bespectacled, bearded and with a tendency to emphasize his well-rounded vowels, Mr. Lipton came across as cerebral, if sometimes sycophantic. He often ended his show with a questionnaire popularized by French television host Bernard Pivot. "If heaven exists," Mr. Lipton asked, "what would you like to hear God say when you arrive?"
"Inside the Actors Studio" won a 2013 Emmy Award for outstanding informational series or special. He left the program in 2018, a year before it moved to Ovation TV.
"The show is, in the end, about the interior life of those who love the art form, about the struggle that leaves them lonely, introspective, unsure," Times journalist Chris Hedges wrote in a 2001 profile of Mr. Lipton. His "encyclopedic knowledge and unconditional acceptance - he lets his guests edit things they do not like from the tape - combine to create intimate and often moving portraits of lives in progress."
Mr. Lipton's earnestness and unctuous flattery was ripe for lampooning. On "Saturday Night Live," Will Ferrell played the Actors Studio host as verbose, self-involved and prone to making grandiose claims about forgettable careers and praising a guest's banalities as wisdom.
Mr. Lipton acknowledged and embraced the caricature, telling CNN that he admired Ferrell. "We're good friends - and I think he's got me cold, the rat," he said.
Louis James Lipton was born in Detroit on Sept. 19, 1926. His mother was a teacher and librarian. His father, who had emigrated from Poland as a child with the surname Lipschitz, abandoned the family for an itinerant life as a fiction writer and educator; later, leading "jazz canto" workshops on the West Coast, he attracted an enthusiastic following among Beat authors such as Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
Raised by his mother and maternal grandparents, the younger Lipton worked odd jobs to help support his family while also developing an interest in theater and radio performance. For a period, he played a child nephew of the Lone Ranger on a local Detroit radio station.
After brief Air Force service, he found himself in Paris. At a financial low point, he worked as a procurer of prostitutes. He returned to the United States determined, he later said, "to be a lawyer because that was as far away from my father's lunacy that I could imagine."
He enrolled in acting classes to prepare himself for a career as a courtroom advocate but became immersed in a cultural milieu that included Strasberg and Harold Clurman. "About five years later, I said to myself, 'Stop kidding. You don't want to be a lawyer. This is what you want to do,' " he recalled in a 2013 Parade interview.
To subsidize more classes in voice, modern dance and choreography, he took acting jobs in low-budget films and had a recurring role as a doctor on the soap opera "The Guiding Light." He began contributing scripts and was soon named head writer of the show in addition to writing for two other soaps, "The Edge of Night" and "Another World."
Mr. Lipton made his Broadway debut as an actor in Lillian Hellman's 1951 drama "The Autumn Garden" and teamed with composer Sol Berkowitz on a Prohibition-era musical called "Nowhere to Go but Up," directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Tom Bosley. The show, for which Mr. Lipton wrote the book and lyrics, closed after a week amid dreadful reviews.
The title, however, proved prophetic. Mr. Lipton's next musical, "Sherry!," with a score by composer Laurence Rosenthal and based on George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's hit comedy "The Man Who Came to Dinner," squeaked out a run that lasted two months. (A 2004 all-star recording of the score - featuring Tommy Tune, Bernadette Peters, Nathan Lane, Carol Burnett and Mike Myers, among others - was greeted with more enthusiasm.)
His first two marriages, to actresses Shirley Blanc and Nina Foch, ended in divorce. In 1970, he married Kedakai Turner, a former model who became a real estate executive. She is his only immediate survivor.
An autodidact, Mr. Lipton taught himself French and Latin, learned to fly planes and was a champion equestrian in show-jumping tournaments. He also wrote a book on language, "An Exaltation of Larks," which examined obscure collective nouns (a murmuration of starlings, a rag of colts, a skulk of foxes) and has been in print since it was first published in 1968. Over the years, he proposed his own nouns of multitude, including an unction of undertakers, a shrivel of critics and a queue of actors.

Texto completo: Coronavirus in Texas
Texas has 11 known coronavirus cases — all of them in the San Antonio area, as of March 2, 2020. All of those were instances of people who got the disease overseas and are now quarantined in the San Antonio Lackland Air Force Base.
More in this series
Local and state officials in Texas are taking action to prevent the further spread of the new deadly strain of coronavirus that originated in China.
Texas is not yet home to “community spread” of the disease— but U.S. health officials warned it is a matter of when, not if, an outbreak hits the U.S.
Here’s what you need to know.
How many people in Texas have coronavirus?
There have been 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus, or COVID-19, in Texas, as of Monday. All of those were instances of people who got the disease overseas and then were brought to the San Antonio Lackland Air Force Base for quarantine.
Patients at the base confirmed or suspected of being infected with the new coronavirus were transferred from quarantine to the Texas Center for Infectious Disease or local hospitals to receive medical care in isolation, according to the San Antonio Express-News.
It’s not clear whether any of those patients diagnosed are Texans.
What’s the latest on coronavirus in Texas?
Passengers flying into select airports are being screened for the virus. Multiple universities have issued travel bans and canceled study abroad programs to and from China and also Italy, which has the highest number of cases outside Asia.
Rice University asked 17 individuals to self-quarantine after a research assistant had contact with a possible case of the virus while traveling. After returning from Italy, around 70 asymptomatic people from the University of Texas at San Antonio were also required to self-quarantine off campus for 14 days.
On Sunday, San Antonio health officials said someone with a “weakly positive” test result for the new coronavirus was briefly released from quarantine after testing negative twice. That person was the only person to test positive out of a group of 91 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, to San Antonio in February and quarantined for 14 days, according to the San Antonio Express-News. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials are notifying Texans who came into contact with the individual while that person was released.
San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said 122 people are being quarantined at the Air Force base who were on the Diamond Princess, a British cruise ship that had more than 700 people test positive for the virus. The people who tested negative at the base were expected to be released Monday, but Nirenberg issued an emergency proclamation demanding that the quarantine be extended until March 9.
Is coronavirus spreading person to person in Texas?
No. Right now, all the known Texas cases are people who were brought to San Antonio for quarantine.
The first instance of coronavirus spreading from person to person in the U.S. occurred in January, when a 60-year-old woman from Illinois contracted the virus in China and transferred the virus to her spouse, according to the CDC.
How many cases are there in the United States?
There were more than 100 cases in the United States as of Monday evening. Six people have died from the virus in the U.S. — all in Washington state, health officials said Monday. Globally, more than 3,000 people have died, and more than 90,000 have the disease.
How does coronavirus compare with the flu?
Coronavirus comes with seasonal flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Severe cases of the virus can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure. It also can be deadly for a small percentage of the population, according to the World Health Organization.

Similar to respiratory illnesses like the flu, coronavirus spreads from person-to-person contact, such as coughing, sneezing or touching infected surfaces, according to the CDC. Both diseases are especially dangerous for people who are older than 65, but the flu is more dangerous for children and pregnant women, according to The New York Times.
However, early reports indicate the coronavirus appears to be more contagious and has a higher fatality rate than the flu. Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine available to prevent or reduce cases of coronavirus.
What’s the fatality rate for coronavirus?
Estimated fatality rates for the disease range from 1% to 4%, higher than the seasonal flu’s 0.1%. But according to a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, the fatality rates for the elderly or people with other underlying health conditions can be much higher — as high as 14% for people over the age of 80.
It is important to note that it is very early and data is still being gathered, so the fatality rate for COVID-19 could change, according to PBS NewsHour.
According to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, of 45,000 confirmed Chinese patients, more than 81% of cases were mild and did not result in pneumonia or resulted only in mild pneumonia. The study said “considerable transmission” of coronavirus occurs when someone is in close contact with people with the virus, such as in family households.
Roughly 2.3% of people who contract coronavirus die, and 5% are considered “critical,” which means the patients suffered organ failure, respiratory failure or septic shock, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control study. But the fatality rate may be considerably less than 1% as more minimally symptomatic cases are detected, according to a report from The New England Journal of Medicine on 1,099 cases from China.
I saw a headline about a possible vaccine for the coronavirus. Is that good news?
While it is true researchers are testing possible solutions, they are almost certainly a long way off from a commercially available vaccine that could prevent the virus. Don’t expect anything immediate.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN it would take around a year for a potential vaccine to be approved. He said the vaccine would need to go through a Phase 1 clinical trial with a few dozen people for three months and then be tested in a second trial with hundreds of people for six to eight months, according to CNN.

Texto completo: Coronavirus in Texas
The latest updates on Texas coronavirus cases: Texas has 11 known cases — all of them in the San Antonio area, as of March 2, 2020. All of those were instances of people who got the disease overseas and are now at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease. More than 120 people are set to be released from quarantine in San Antonio on Tuesday, March 3.
More in this series
A person in the San Antonio area had a “weakly positive” test result for the new coronavirus after being released from federally managed quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base, local health officials said Sunday. The person has since been placed back in quarantine, according to a statement from San Antonio Metro Health.
“Metro Health has been tracking where the person went, who they interacted with, timeframes outside the federally ordered quarantine and who may have been exposed,” the statement said. “This information will be shared with the public when completed.”
Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are notifying people who had contact with the person after they left isolation, according to a statement that local health officials attributed to the federal agency.
The person was treated and isolated for weeks after their return to the United States from Wuhan, China on a U.S. State Department chartered flight. The individual was allowed to leave isolation after they appeared to be asymptomatic, had two negative test results and met all criteria for release, according to the CDC statement.
“Following the patient’s release, results of a subsequent sample were received, and determined to be weakly positive,” the statement said. “Out of an abundance of caution, CDC decided to bring the individual back into isolation at a local medical facility.”
A San Antonio Metropolitan Health District official told CNN that 16 people have been identified as coming in contact with the patient. Fourteen of those people are considered at low risk for exposure, while two are considered at medium risk.
The patient reportedly spent 12 hours "in the community," visiting a hotel and spending two hours between 5:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Saturday at North Star Mall. Dr. Anita Kurlan said the person mostly sat by themselves in the mall's food court and the risk of exposure at both locations is low, CNN reported. Still, health officials requested a "deep cleaning" of the mall.
Lackland Air Force Base is also where some evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were quarantined after they were repatriated to the United States against CDC’s recommendation.
San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said in a statement Sunday that it was “unacceptable” that CDC allowed the patient flown from Wuhan to leave isolation.
“We will do everything within our power to ensure that the community is kept safe and the exposure risk remains low,” Nirenberg said. “The federal quarantine period for the Diamond Princess cruise ship evacuees ends tomorrow March 2. I have asked the CDC to do everything in their power to ensure that those who are released pose no risk to the community.”
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-San Antonio, called upon the House to investigate CDC's protocols for treating coronavirus patients.
"The CDC’s premature release of a quarantined patient carrying the coronavirus into San Antonio raises serious questions about CDC management, protocols and the attentiveness of the Administration to public safety," Castro said.
As of Saturday, there have been 74 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States, according to The New York Times. The official tally in Texas remains at 11 — all of them in the San Antonio area. The case disclosed Sunday is the first case in Texas in which a person who tested positive for the virus was known to have been outside the federal quarantine area.
While state officials continue to say that the risk to average Texans remains low, worries about the virus have begun to spread. On Saturday, Rice University asked 17 individuals to self-isolate after a research assistant was found to have contact with a possible case of the virus while traveling abroad. And on Sunday, CERAWeek 2020, an international energy conference in Houston, was canceled "in light of developing circumstances." Delegates from more than 80 countries were expected to attend the event, which was scheduled for March 9-13.

Texto completo: Two weeks ago, I was happily sailing on a huge cruise ship in the Indian Ocean.
My wife Collen is a travel agent and I was tagging along with her and her group on a Celebrity Cruise Line ship as it sailed from Dubai to Singapore and back with 2,300 souls aboard.
Everyone on board our ship knew what was happening that same week to the unlucky people stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked offshore Tokyo.
Because a passenger who left Diamond Princess nine days earlier in Hong Kong had tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping China, the Japanese government had ordered everyone to stay aboard the luxury cruise ship.
We weren’t doctors or epidemiologists, just vacationers.
But we knew that cooping 2,666 people together on the Diamond Princess for 14 days was going to be trouble - and it was.
Because Japanese officials dithered around and then screwed up their containment measures on the ship for two weeks, the Diamond Princess became what the New York Times called “a floating epidemiological disaster.”
According to the Times, “with 634 infections and two deaths, the cruise ship represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.”
We were a lot luckier, even though we never made it all the way to Singapore.
Our wise captain decided it wasn’t worth the risk of getting any closer to the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak and we turned back to Dubai after stopping at Sri Lanka.
The Celebrity Cruise Line people did everything right. Everyone was compensated for their lost cruise time and given $500 to pay for straightening up their travel arrangements.
Most important, as far as I know no one on our cruise ship caught the flu.
Since I’ve been back in Southern California, however, I’ve been getting sick watching the mainstream media sensationalize the dangers of the coronavirus.
Every time another country like Brazil gets its first official coronovirus case, they throw up another panicky headline about how the deadly pandemic is putting every human on the planet at risk.
The mainstream media rarely take the trouble to point out that it is the already sick, the very old and the very young who are most likely to die from flu-caused problems like pneumonia, strokes and heart attacks.
The coronavirus may yet live up to its media hype and become a true pandemic in the United States or elsewhere that kills hundreds of thousands.
But as the stock market dropped a few thousand points this week on the Dow Jones, it’d be a nice public service if the media put the death toll of the coronavirus in the proper perspective.
President Trump did exactly that during his press conference on Wednesday.
He pointed out to the entire country that old-fashioned Asian flu - the regular kind of constantly changing viruses that many of us take shots for every year - kills from 25,000 to 69,000 Americans a year.
Every year after every year after every year.
When President Trump admitted he was “shocked” to learn that the “regular” flu was so deadly, he was of course mocked for his ignorance by the mainstream liberal media and their Democrat pals.
They would like you to think President Trump is the only person in America who wasn’t up to speed on America’s annual flu deaths, which actually are statistical estimates made by the Centers for Disease Control.
But I bet most Republicans and Democrats were unaware of how deadly the “regular” flu is.
For example, did you know that 2017-2018 was one of the deadliest flu seasons in our history?
Did you know that 80,000 Americans - older, younger, sicker Americans - died that flu season, the most since the mid-1970s?
Do you remember the scary media stories, the doomsday predictions, the panic in the streets, the stock market crash of early 2018, the soccer games played in empty stadiums, the closing of public schools?
Neither do I - and neither do the media.

Texto completo: Readers of the Italian edition of Vogue magazine got a glimpse of Lancaster city and Amish Country last month.
In a Feb. 14 article (in Italian) in the venerable fashion magazine, a writer and photographer chronicle their journey through Pennsylvania, including travels through Lancaster and Chester counties. Writer Michele Fossi mentions several Lancaster County businesses in the article.
The article is supplemented with photos by Clara Vannucci, including several of Amish life — barns, bikes and buggies.
In the Lancaster section of the article, which also covers Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and the Brandywine Valley, Fossi talks about a driving tour through Amish Country, with Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society board member Carl Laws Landis as a guide.
Fossi describes the dress and the buggies and scooters of the Amish, offers some history of 18th-century Anabaptist immigration to Lancaster County and talks about the concept of mutual aid within the Amish community.
Writing about Lancaster city, Fossi talks about sampling shoofly pie, whoopie pies and “famous” Amish granola at Central Market.
In a rough English translation from the Italian article, Fossi strikes a contrast between the county and city, writing that “… Lancaster, a city mostly inhabited by a secular population, has much more to offer than the experience of getting to know the Amish up close. First of all, it is a center of great architectural value, with numerous perfectly preserved buildings dating back to the 19th century, which deserve to be admired with attention.”
At Bistro Barberet & Bakery on East King Street, which Fossi calls "one of the best restaurants in town," he interviews pastry chef Cedric Barberet about the evolving Lancaster food scene and the local agricultural bounty that feeds it.
Fossi writes about the reinterpreted traditional French dishes — featuring locally sourced ingredients — served at the restaurant and "elegant patisserie" run by Barberet and his wife, Estelle, and about sampling the macarons and chocolate layer cake in the bakery.
Fossi also describes the ornate interior and historic landmark status of the Fulton Theatre, saying the productions “can be on a par with those of Manhattan.”
He also writes about being pampered and “immersed in the nostalgic atmosphere of a mid-19th-century novel, among floral wallpapers (and) paintings” at the Inn & Spa at Intercourse Village.
Fossi and Vannucci also visited Meadow View Heirloom Greenhouse and Herb Shop in Bird-in-Hand, and writes of the herbal teas sold there and about listening to people speak in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect.
The article also covers the city of Philadelphia and its environs — including the Winterthur Museum in Delaware and Longwood Gardens — along with Pittsburgh and New York City.
This certainly isn't the first time Lancaster has gotten attention in prominent media outlets. The city has made several "best-of" lists for places to visit. In 2015, the New York Times spotlighted local businesses for their farm-to-table attitude.
In 2016, the New York Post dubbed Lancaster a “mini-Brooklyn” for its food and arts scene, and Paste magazine called it “the new ‘Portlandia,’” referring to the IFC channel’s hipster take on Portland, Oregon.

Texto completo: Miss Saigon seems to be one of those musicals that people either love or loathe.
At least judging by critics’ reactions to the Cameron Mackintosh-produced revival that, along with its famous helicopter, will land on Tuesday at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach.
The New York Times’ Ben Brantley said the 2017 Broadway production “feels about as affecting as a historical diorama, albeit a lavishly appointed one.”
Director Laurence Connor’s decision to move the show’s center of gravity away from the sleazy, cynical Engineer to the star-crossed lovers Kim and Chris diminishes the show, he said, because “they’re hemmed in by a score that reduces them to love-struck archetypes.”
The Chicago Tribune’s Chris Jones was impressed by Connor’s take on the show. In his view Connor “understands that audiences are shelling out the big bucks for a huge romantic spectacle and, with the help of designer Adrian Vaux, delivers that in such a way that no one is likely to leave the theater saying that Miss Saigon was so much bigger and better in the 1990s.”
Jones said the North American tour’s cast was the best of the three productions of the revival he’s seen.
Miss Saigon is the latest blockbuster original producer Mackintosh has dusted off, following his successes with revivals of The Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables.
It’s taken him a while to revive Miss Saigon, which debuted on Broadway in 1991, because “it requires such a huge international cast of Asian and Western performers and a vast array of visually stunning sets,” he said in the show’s promotional materials.
This version features Bob Avian’s original choreography but new sets, costumes, lighting and sound. The revival “takes a grittier, more realistic approach that magnifies the power and epic sweep of Boublil and Schonberg’s tremendous score,” Mackintosh said.
Those familiar with the
musical will recall that its French creators, Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, transposed the story from Giacomo Puccini’s 1904 opera Madama Butterfly to Saigon as the Americans were beating a retreat from the Vietnam War.
According to Mackintosh “the tragic love story at the heart of the show has become even more relevant today with innocent people being torn apart by war all over the world.”
The revival avoids the controversy that bedeviled the original production, which starred white actor Jonathan Pryce as the Engineer, by casting performers of Asian descent as the Vietnamese characters.
The show is still a spectacle.
The helicopter, which descends in the second act to carry off Chris and leave Kim behind, weighs more than 3 tons and is 26 feet tall. The craft’s hall-swallowing impact is increased by holographic projections.
The show travels in nine trucks, which it no doubt needs to carry the 16 costumes changes worn by the women in the ensemble, the soldiers’ flak jackets and helmets (all once used in action) and everything else required to surround its 42-member cast with an immersive environment.
Instruments played by the 15-member orchestra include Asian flutes and 77 different percussion instruments, including skull drums, ankle bells, singing bowls, Thai chap cymbals and kabuki blocks.
There’s no denying that Miss Saigon is one of the most popular shows in musical theater history. The original production ran for nearly 10 years on Broadway.
The show has been performed in 32 countries, in 15 languages and has been seen by more than 36 million people worldwide.

Texto completo: Rep. Devin Nunes filed a lawsuit for $250 million in damages against the Washington Post and intelligence reporter Shane Harris, alleging that a story from the paper related to a classified House Intelligence Committee briefing on Russian interference amounted to defamation.

“This action arises out of a WaPo hit piece that was manufactured out of whole cloth,” the California Republican’s 23-page Monday complaint said. “Billionaire Jeff Bezos purchased WaPo in 2013 for the purpose of using WaPo’s mighty pen to influence Federal elections."
It continued, "Bezos’ WaPo heavily promoted the Russian ‘collusion’ hoax between 2017 and 2019, in spite of the fact that there was no evidence that any member of the Trump campaign colluded with any ‘Russian’ to influence the 2016 Presidential Election. This is 2020. As this case illustrates, Bezos and his printing press remain desperate to defame the President of the United States and his allies in Congress. This defamation must end.”
Kris Coratti Kelly, the Washington Post’s vice president of communications, defended the paper and its reporters.
“The Post stands behind the reporting of Shane Harris and his colleagues,” Kelly said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “We will vigorously defend our work against the claims made in Rep. Nunes’s lawsuit.”
The Washington Post story in question was published on Feb. 20 and revolved around leaked details from a classified Feb. 13 briefing conducted in part by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community election threats executive under then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. Sources cited by the New York Times claimed Pierson warned, “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”

But a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Examiner, “Shelby did not say Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump.”

The Washington Post wrote, “Maguire, a career official who is respected by the intelligence rank and file, was considered a leading candidate to be nominated to the post of DNI, White House aides had said” but that Trump’s opinion “shifted” when “he heard from a Republican ally about the official’s remarks.” The newspaper further claimed, “Trump learned about Pierson’s remarks from Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the committee’s ranking Republican and a staunch Trump ally, said one person familiar with the matter.”
The paper cited a source who claimed the briefing “was the catalyst” that led Trump to replace Maguire with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence. But the New York Times cited two administration officials who said that “the timing was coincidental,” that “Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles,” and that “Mr. Trump had never felt a kinship with Mr. Maguire.”

And national security adviser Robert O’Brien said Trump didn't make the personnel switch because of the briefing.
“I was in that meeting, and the president was not angry with Joe Maguire. He thinks very highly of, of Admiral, Adm. Maguire and would've liked him to stay in government in a different role. But, as you know, Adm. Maguire’s time as the acting DNI was up in a week or two,” O’Brien told ABC News. He added, “Adm. Maguire is held in the highest regard. I've never heard anyone criticize Adm. Maguire, including the president, for briefing him … I think the president thinks very highly of him.”

The Washington Post wrote, “Trump erroneously believed that Pierson had given the assessment exclusively to Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, people familiar with the matter said.”
Nunes criticized the alleged “intentional misrepresentations” and said he pointed to “the truth.”

“Devin Nunes never told the President or anyone else that Shelby Pierson had given an exclusive briefing to Schiff. Devin Nunes, did not meet or speak with the President on February 13, 2020 — the day of the ‘classified hearing’ — or on February 14, 2020, and never conveyed to him any indication that Schiff was given an exclusive assessment of Russian actions,” Nunes lawyer Steven Biss wrote.
The complaint also said, “Nunes did not say or do anything to ‘ruin’ Maguire’s chances of becoming the permanent intelligence chief.”
Nunes claimed that “the WaPo Hit Piece” imputed to him “criminal conduct” as well as “dishonesty, deceit, sharp, and unethical practices,” which he said “impugn” his “integrity” and “prejudice” him in the performance of his congressional duties.
The GOP congressman accused the Washington Post and Harris of “acting in concert with House Democrats” and attacked Harris as a “well-known puppet of the FBI and CIA.” Nunes cited as proof the fact that the reporter incorrectly claimed in January 2018 that British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier “was not used as the basis for a FISA warrant on Carter Page.” Nunes claimed the article in question was a “reprisal” for the findings of the DOJ watchdog report on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse, which “exposed” the Washington Post and Harris as “liars.”

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded in December that the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation was flawed. The watchdog criticized the DOJ and the FBI for 17 “significant errors and omissions” related to the surveillance of Page and its heavy reliance on Steele’s salacious and unverified dossier.

Buttigieg considers Biden endorsement after speaking with Obama

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg is considering an endorsement of Joe Biden after talking to former President Barack Obama and dropping out of the presidential race.
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, dropped out of the contest on Sunday. A Democratic official told the New York Times that the decision was made after Buttigieg spoke with Biden and Obama on Sunday night.
The source said Obama did not encourage Buttigieg to endorse any specific candidate but told the former mayor he holds significant influence and should take that into account before throwing his support behind somebody.
During the conversation with Biden, the former vice president asked Buttigieg to support his campaign, and the former mayor said he would consider it. Buttigieg told aides he would sleep on it.
Buttigieg, who was the first openly gay major presidential candidate, appeared to take swipes at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a socialist, during his speech Sunday night as he announced the end of his campaign.
"We need leadership to heal a divided nation, not drive us further apart," he said. "We need a broad-based agenda that can truly deliver for the American people, not one that gets lost in ideology."
Buttigieg held the delegate lead through the first two states that voted in the Democratic primary but failed to gain much support outside of his college-educated white voter base. He finished fourth in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, garnering just 8% of the vote and zero delegates before dropping out.
Sanders leads the Democratic primary field with 58 delegates heading into Super Tuesday; Biden has 50. The Vermont independent also leads national polling with 28.5% support while Biden has 20% support, according to a RealClearPolitics average.

Democratic opposition to Sanders will end the moment he wins the nomination

Texto completo: Enjoy the Democratic infighting over Sen. Bernie Sanders’s primary candidacy while it lasts. The intraparty squabbling over the Vermont senator’s ascent will last exactly up to the moment he wins the nomination and not a moment later.
Unlike the Republican Party, which splintered into warring factions in 2016 over the rise of President Trump, Democratic opposition to Sanders has nothing to do with ideology. Anti-Sanders Democrats do not oppose the senator because he is a dictator-sympathizing, left-wing radical. They oppose him merely because they believe he will make it more difficult for them to become a majoritarian party. As this is their only real hang-up about Sanders, they will all fall into line and support him if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Because it is about power.
Evidence of the Left’s halfhearted, politically expedient opposition to Sanders is never clearer than when it comes from Democrats who previously had denounced either the senator or his brand of politics, all while leaving open the door to supporting him in the general election.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, was asked recently whether she was comfortable having Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee in November.

“Yes,” she replied. “I think whoever our nominee is, we will enthusiastically embrace, and we will win the White House, the Senate, and the House."

But it was Pelosi who said last year in a 60 Minutes interview that Democrats do not support Sanders's brand of left-wing politics.

"I do reject socialism as an economic system,” she said. “If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party."

Failed two-time presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said elsewhere of endorsing Sanders should he win the nomination that “the No. 1 priority for our country and world is retiring Trump, and, as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.”

Earlier, however, Clinton refused to say whether she would support Sanders, saying instead in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, “I’m not going to go there yet.” She said during that same interview that it was not just Sanders who was toxic, but also his “leadership team,” his “prominent supporters,” his “online Bernie Bros,” and the “culture around him.”

Then there is Democratic strategist James Carville, who lamented recently in an interview with Vox: “We just had an election in 2018. We did great. We talked about everything we needed to talk about, and we won. And now it’s like we’re losing our damn minds.”
“The Democratic Party isn’t Bernie Sanders, whatever you think about Sanders. … Bernie Sanders isn’t a Democrat,” he continued. "He’s never been a Democrat. He’s an ideologue.”
Amusingly enough, Carville said in the same interview: “If Bernie is the nominee, I’ll vote for him. No question.” Carville also said later in response to Sanders calling him a “political hack”: “At least I’m not a communist."

In their own words, Sanders is an awful, toxic communist, whose views are not that of the Democratic Party, but they plan to support him anyway if he is the nominee. Square that circle, please.
In the news media, there are similar attempts by once-anti-Sanders voices to warm up to the idea of the senator winning the Democratic nomination.

New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg, for example, said last week that the Vermont senator would be an excellent candidate to take on the Russians. She writes:
Under Trump, the U.S. has abandoned the pretense of backing democracy and human rights, meaning there are no longer any great powers that even pretend to put morality at the center of foreign affairs. The horror of this era isn’t just the emergence of an axis of authoritarianism, but the fact that there are so few allies to counter it. If Sanders was elected president, that could change. His unlikely ascendance would be a blow against the corrosive cynicism in which authoritarianism thrives. America would be the country where young people of all races powered a campaign that proved stronger than plutocracy, stronger than nationalist demagogy, stronger than any of the tools that men like Putin have used to bring liberalism to its knees. To young idealists around the world, America would look — dare I say it — great again.
Earlier, however, Goldberg warned readers about Sanders and his “legions of trolls” who antagonize Democrats who “stand in their way.” Her article, titled “Bernie Could Win the Nomination. Should We Be Afraid?” ends with her saying she has no idea whether the senator can win the general election. Goldberg comes to that conclusion only after telling her readers that the “Sanders juggernaut still scares me” and that she is “terrified” his polling will not hold up against Republican attack ads.
At MSNBC, anchor Chris Matthews offered a full-throated, on-air apology recently after he compared Sanders’s victory in the Nevada caucuses with the Nazi invasion of France.

“Sen. Sanders, I’m sorry for comparing anything from that tragic era, in which so many suffered, especially the Jewish people, to an elected result in which you were a well-deserved winner,” Matthews said. “This is going to be a hard-fought, heated campaign of ideas.”

The apology came days after the MSNBC host also warned that there would be executions in Central Park if a socialist were allowed to become president of the United States. From warning about public executions to saying it is all just a “heated campaign of ideas.” What an about-face!

Worth mentioning: Many of Matthews's MSNBC colleagues have compared Trump and members of his administration with the Nazis. No apologies have ever been issued for these comparisons.

Then there is NBC News itself, which agreed recently to feature more pro-Sanders voices on MSNBC after the senator reportedly berated network executives over their negative coverage of his campaign.

It cannot be missed that these changes of heart coincide exactly with the likelihood that Sanders will be the 2020 Democratic nominee.

There will be no “Never Bernie” movement on the Left if Sanders wins the Democratic nomination because this is not about ideology. Democrats do not care whether a left-wing radical takes hold of the party. They care only about political power. If Sanders is their guy in 2020, then so be it. They will support him, even if they think he is a communist.

As always with Democrats, it is about power first.

'Toxic masculinity' is a fantasy weaponized by the media

Texto completo: "Toxic masculinity” is an idea that lives in the anxious minds of social justice maniacs and really nowhere else.
The New York Times on Friday ran a truly pathetic op-ed by author Teddy Wayne who professed that when his wife got pregnant, he hoped the baby would be a girl, in part, so that he might not be faced with the challenge of “raising a nontoxic man.”
Huh. What about just doing what any normal parent would do and aspire to raise a decent human, regardless of gender?
“If he gets hurt, physically or emotionally, what amount of crying is appropriate?” wondered Wayne. “If someone relentlessly bullies him, is he ever justified in fighting back? How vulnerably nontoxic should he make himself in a world that preys on the undefended — but whose opposite is the grotesque alpha-male caricature?”
Reading about someone having these thoughts is exhausting. I can’t imagine what actually having them feels like.
Toxic masculinity is yet another concept born of the sick social justice ideology infecting every part of American culture, serving as yet one more way to reinforce the spread of victimhood, grievance, and oppression.
A separate article in the Times last year attempted to define toxic masculinity as “what can come of teaching boys that they can’t express emotion openly; that they have to be ‘tough all the time’; that anything other than that makes them ‘feminine’ or weak.”
That’s all fine and good, but as with all things social justice, a perhaps harmless idea is then weaponized to take down those deemed by the movement to benefit from unearned “privilege” (a term really reserved for anyone who doesn’t submit to the social justice scheme).
That fact and evidence that toxic masculinity exists solely as a scary fiction was best captured in a New Yorker article back in October 2018 by liberal visual artist Richard Moose. Accompanying the article was a video created by Moose portraying “white-male rage,” which he said reflected much about, who else, President Trump, as well as the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.
“I feel that the performance of masculinity (not the individuals themselves, who must be understood as actors) depicted in this simple video resonates with Kavanaugh’s entitled, defensive rage, as well as that of the angry Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee who also lashed out,” wrote Moose. “I hope the video gives viewers pause to consider how, sometimes, the toxic forms of masculinity that are fostered in élite school systems are not simply allowed to exist at the highest levels of government but seem almost required.”
Yes, Moose compared Kavanaugh’s “entitled, defensive rage” (Quick reminder: He was accused of rape), not to any other real life event, but to a video of a bunch of actors who literally did nothing more but scream into a camera.
It’s a social justice fantasy that we’re forever told is real by people such as Moose and Teddy Wayne, with a helpful assist from the national media.
Clap, if you believe.

Texto completo: The two attorneys representing the official who reported the phone call that spurred an impeachment investigation of the president urged Congress to bolster protections for future whistleblowers.
Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times calling for Congress to strengthen whistleblower protection laws, arguing that their former client faced a “sustained campaign of intimidation” after filing a complaint about President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
“Our former client faced, and still faces, a sustained public campaign of intimidation — including repeated tweets by President Trump and other senior figures that the whistle-blower must be publicly outed — despite having participated in an established and encouraged process that guaranteed them certain protections under the law,” the attorneys wrote. “Even members of Congress, individuals within the very body that created the statutory protections that exist for whistle-blowers, sought to expose the whistle-blower for political purposes and created harmful doubts concerning the integrity of the system.”
Bakaj and Zaid discussed how Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, said the whistleblower they represented “acted in good faith and followed the law every step of the way.” They said harassment by Trump and his allies could scare away potential whistleblowers who, in the future, might consider alerting Congress when they witness wrongdoing in the executive branch.
“When certain members of Congress attack a lawful whistle-blower, as our former client is, they jeopardize their own constitutional right to conduct oversight over the executive branch and intelligence-related matters,” they wrote. “Rather than weakening the system, members of Congress should seek to strengthen it so they can be effective in their constitutionally mandated oversight role.”
Republicans raised concerns about the whistleblower after learning the official sought guidance from a member of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s staff before filing a complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector general. Some demanded to know the name of the official, while others spread the name of a CIA official they believed was the whistleblower.
The two attorneys urged Congress to pass additional laws protecting whistleblowers, including “imposing penalties for exposing or intimidating lawful whistle-blowers and their attorneys.” This change would have benefited Zaid, who was targeted by Trump after his old tweets revealed that he supported an impeachment “coup” against the president. At least one person was charged with threatening Zaid after the president singled him out.
The two attorneys also called for the creation of a “more direct path for intelligence community employees to report wrongdoing to Congress involving White House officials and even the president.”
The Ukraine whistleblower's identity was never publicly confirmed. The House impeached Trump on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges, but the Senate acquitted him on both impeachment articles.
The two attorneys called whistleblowers the “foundation of our democracy,” writing: “We hope our former client’s moral courage and personal integrity will inspire others to follow the law and speak up when they see something they reasonably believe to be wrong. All government leaders should encourage the process: Protecting whistle-blowers should never be a partisan activity. Lawful whistle-blowers should always — always — be protected from reprisal.”

New restrictions placed on Chinese journalists after country expelled US reporters

Texto completo: The State Department has issued new limits on the number of Chinese journalists who can work for five China-run news organizations, escalating a diplomatic feud between the two countries.
The new restrictions were announced on Monday. While they won't result in the direct expulsion of Chinese reporters, they could force some to leave if their visas are tethered to the media group they work for, according to the New York Times. There are currently 160 Chinese nationals working at the five outlets, but that number will now be capped at 100.
The rule only applies to media companies the United States considers propaganda outlets: Xinhua, CGTN, China Radio, China Daily, and People’s Daily. The decrease would force the organizations to decide which Chinese workers to keep on staff unless the employees are able to obtain a different type of visa.
According to the State Department, the move is meant to punish the Chinese government for its poor record on press freedom toward foreign reporters from the U.S. and other countries. Last month, China revoked the press credentials of three Wall Street Journal reporters as punishment for an opinion piece that the country deemed discriminatory. The expulsions marked the first time the country had forced out foreign journalists in more than two decades.
Prior to the Monday decision, U.S. officials were weighing what punitive action to take against China. Some in the White House reportedly wanted to expel dozens of journalists, while other officials were concerned that doing so would be received poorly because of the Constitution’s right to freedom of the press.
In addition to the Wall Street Journal revocations, China has let the visas of multiple reporters who are seen as critical of its government to expire. The decision to expel the three journalists was made just a day after the U.S. said it would consider the five Chinese news organizations as functionaries of a foreign government, similar to how it sees foreign diplomats.

Ivanka Trump touts fundraising prowess as Trump campaign gears up

Texto completo: Ivanka Trump made few public appearances for candidate Donald Trump as he campaigned in the last presidential cycle, but this is set to change.
In an interview with the New York Times published Monday, she touted her fundraising prowess, claiming she could outraise former Vice President Joe Biden. She pointed to one occasion where she raised $2 million in 45 minutes. "It was pretty record-shattering," she said of the total.
Events in Oklahoma City, Naples, Florida, Austin, Texas, and New York City on the calendar for late March and early April signal a growing role for the president's eldest daughter on his campaign with a slate of fundraising luncheons that will draw attendees paying from $2,800 for one person to $50,000 per couple. Photo opportunities are included for the highest contributors, or those who raise from $15,000 to $25,000 and up.

A highly valued surrogate for the Trump team, the shift marks a departure from her quieter West Wing role. She has staked out a newly combative stance on social media and on cable television, criticizing her father's impeachment and lashing out at Democrats. On Friday, she spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, a pro-Trump Republican gathering that featured high-profile Trump campaign and administration officials. Last month, she attended a New Hampshire "Cops for Trump" event.
Ivanka Trump has been criticized in the past for her role as an unpaid White House adviser, with some charging that she was unqualified for a senior advisory role. In response, she has called this "noise," vowing to fight for the president's agenda. "I’m pretty thick-skinned," she has said previously. "I choose to be happy and aim for impact."
And she is also praised. Last month, a leading national manufacturing group credited her with boosting jobs "like no one in government has ever done." As Trump's "jobs czar," she has played a key role in such Trump policies as sentencing commutation, prisoner reentry schemes, and jobs training.
A Republican since 2018, the former Democrat said she changed her status to vote for her father in New York's closed state primary. “I am a proud Trump Republican,” she told the Times of the shift.

Biden insists Trump 'muzzling' top health official after denial

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden slammed President Trump over claims the White House "muzzled" a top health official from speaking openly about the dangers of the coronavirus.
"Look, this is about knowing where it is, who has it, and how to deal with it. And I see — I see no preparedness other than a political talking points, putting someone in charge who is not a scientist and not — and muzzling the scientist," the Democratic presidential candidate said on ABC's This Week on Sunday. "This is not a Democratic hoax. This is incompetence on the part of the president of the United States at the expense of the country and the world."
Both Trump and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, denied he was "muzzled" by the administration during a White House news conference on Saturday. Fauci called it a "misunderstanding."
"We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, 'Let's regroup and figure out how we're going to be communicating.' So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared," Fauci said.
Trump, who called the coronavirus the Democrats' latest "hoax," has been criticized for not reacting to the coronavirus more quickly and for his decision to appoint Vice President Mike Pence to take the lead on the U.S. response effort.
Last week, the New York Times reported that Fauci met with Pence, who said the spread of the virus was "very serious." According to the report, Fauci told aides Pence had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.
Democratic Rep. John Garamendi said Fauci canceled several Sunday show appearances after Pence's office "took over."

Most coronavirus cases are mild. That’s mostly good news.

Texto completo: Hong Kong • As a dangerous new coronavirus has ravaged China and spread throughout the rest of the world, the outbreak’s toll has sown fear and anxiety. Nearly 3,000 deaths. More than 81,000 cases. Six continents infected.
But government officials and medical experts, in their warnings about the epidemic, have also sounded a note of reassurance: Although the virus can be deadly, the vast majority of those infected so far have only mild symptoms and make full recoveries.
It is an important factor to understand, medical experts said, both to avoid unnecessary global panic and to get a clear picture of the likelihood of transmission.
“Many people are now panicking, and some actually are exaggerating the risks,” said Dr. Jin Dongyan, a virology expert at the University of Hong Kong. “For governments, for public health professionals — they also have to deal with these, because these will also be harmful.”
Much about the virus remains unknown, and the danger could intensify as it travels through the rest of the world. But based on existing information, here’s what experts said about the severity of the virus.

More than 80% of cases are mild, one large study in China found.
Of the 44,672 coronavirus cases that were confirmed in China by Feb. 11, more than 36,000 — or 81% — were mild, according to a study published recently by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Cases were considered mild if they did not involve pneumonia, defined as infection of the lungs, or involved only mild pneumonia, the authors wrote in the study, which is among the largest to date of the new coronavirus.
There were two other categories of cases, severe and critical. Severe cases featured shortness of breath, low blood oxygen saturation or other lung problems. Critical cases featured respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction.
Just under 14% of patients were severe and just under 5% critical.
The overall fatality rate in China was 2.3%. But that number was inflated by the much higher fatality rate in Hubei province of 2.9%, compared with a rate of just 0.4% in the rest of the country. The seasonal flu, by comparison, has a mortality rate of about 0.1%.
The true fatality rate could be even lower, given that many mild or asymptomatic cases may not have been reported to authorities.

A mild case may look like the common cold.
Mild cases are inherently difficult for scientists to describe because those with limited symptoms may not seek medical care. Scientists have also said that people can be infected but not show any symptoms at all.
For many with mild infections, the coronavirus could be virtually indistinguishable from the common cold or seasonal flu, said Jin of the University of Hong Kong.
“Some of these patients, they just go unrecognized,” he said. “It could be just as small as a sore throat. Then one day, two days, it’s gone.”
Even among patients who do go see a doctor, “it could still be very mild, just like a flu,” he added.
As the Chinese Center for Disease Control’s study showed, some mild cases may involve pneumonia. They may also include mild fatigue and low fever, according to a treatment plan released by the central Chinese government.
A small study of 99 confirmed coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, published in the medical journal The Lancet found that most of the patients had fever or cough when they were admitted to the hospital, and some had shortness of breath or muscle ache. The study did not distinguish between mild, severe and critical cases.
Most people with mild infections recover.
There is no doubt that the virus can be dangerous, especially for critical cases. Of those patients, 49% died, according the study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control.
But critical cases made up just a tiny fraction of the total caseload in the study.
By Thursday, of the 78,487 confirmed cases in China, 32,495, or 41%, had been discharged from the hospital, according to China’s National Health Commission. About 8,300 of the remaining patients were in serious condition. More than 2,700 people have died in China.
Many of the deaths have occurred in Hubei province, where the outbreak began and where the demand for care has overwhelmed medical staff. The high mortality rate there could have dangerous implications for developing countries. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, has warned repeatedly of the toll the virus could exact in places with weak health systems.
But for mild cases, the virus is likely “self-limiting,” Jin said, meaning that symptoms will go away on their own, as with the flu and common cold.
But the plethora of mild cases can make containment more difficult.
The number of mild cases, though, creates its own complications for curbing the virus’s spread.
Those with mild or no symptoms may not know they have contracted the virus or may pass it off as a seasonal cold. They may then continue in their daily lives — traveling, kissing, coming into close contact with others — and spread the virus without anyone knowing.
“In this manner, a virus that poses a low health threat on the individual level can pose a high risk on the population level, with the potential to cause disruptions of global public health systems and economic losses,” a group of five scientists wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.
There are, broadly speaking, two possible outcomes of the current outbreak, Jin said. The new virus could, like SARS, another well-known coronavirus, become less and less transmissible as it spreads around the world, eventually dying out.
Alternatively, the new coronavirus could become well established in humans, becoming a kind of recurring seasonal nuisance like the flu, Jin said. In that situation, people would learn to live with it and sometimes would contract illnesses from it, but the virus would most likely also lose some of its dangerousness as time went on. Experts could also develop a vaccine, Jin added.
Even mild cases could provide immunity from future infection.
Several medical experts have said that those who have been infected with the coronavirus will not become infected again, as their bodies will produce antibodies that provide immunity.
“As long as the virus doesn’t evolve, there is no chance of being infected again,” Dr. Lu Hongzhou, a public health professor in Shanghai, said Tuesday in an interview with Beijing News.
And that immunity should extend even to those who had mild or even asymptomatic infections. “Anyone recovered from the infection should have useful antibodies,” Jin said.
The body’s natural immune response is the reason Chinese authorities have asked recovered patients to donate blood plasma, in the hopes that their antibodies could be used to treat sick patients. The government has also prescribed antiviral drugs and traditional Chinese medicine as treatment methods.

En 2016, no le dijo tiempo de cambiar su registro y no pudo votar a su padre en las primarias.
Según los datos de la Junta Electoral de la Ciudad de Nueva York, Ivanka Trump r ealizó el cambio el 22 de octubre de 2018 , justo antes de las elecciones de mitad de periodo.
“Soy una orgullosa republicana de Trump “, dijo la política en una entrevista en la que habló sobre su evolución política y el papel que su padre había jugado en ella. “Creo que ha ampliado el alcance del Partido Republicano , lo cual es realmente importante para mí”.
Este cambio es significativo porque algunas élites demócratas veían a la hija del presidente como un puente hacia los moderados por su postura más progresista respecto al cambio climático, la igualdad salarial o el permiso parental.
Ivanka Trump, según The New York Times, presionó a su padre para que no sacara a Estados Unidos del Acuerdo de París y consiguió que no se tumbara las protecciones que el colectivo LGTBI consiguió en la Administración Obama.

Texto completo: I’m excited to tell you that on March 14 and 15, The Texas Tribune Festival and South by Southwest will co-present a second round of what we call “Conversations about America’s Future,” a series of one-on-one interviews and panel discussions on forward-looking topics that affect all of us in Texas, the U.S. and around the world — issues like diplomacy, cybersecurity, the intersection of gender and policy, the rule of law, the growing power of mayors, and the generational churn in leadership. The two-day program will again be part of SXSW and will take place at the Fairmont Hotel in downtown Austin, across the street from the city’s convention center.
Last year, you may recall, TTF and SXSW co-hosted a weekend of sit-downs with announced and potential Democratic and Republican presidential candidates (Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Secretary Julián Castro; Govs. John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, John Kasich and William Weld; and U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren) and a stand-in of sorts for POTUS (U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy). The nine interviews were conducted by different big-brand members of the media, including HuffPost’s Lydia Polgreen, BuzzFeed’s Ben Smith, Politico’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, Recode’s Kara Swisher, and TIME’s Anand Giridharadas.
This year, we’re shifting our focus from the presidential race and widening the aperture — putting a more diverse group of interviewees and subjects on the agenda.
We kick off at 9:30 a.m. Saturday the 14th with U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California, interviewed by Kasie Hunt, Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News and the host of the MSNBC show "Kasie DC."
At 11 a.m., former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the author of "The Nation City: Why Mayors are Running the World," records an episode of the "Recode Decode" podcast with Kara Swisher, co-founder and editor at large of Recode.
At 2 p.m., former Fox News anchor and best-selling author Gretchen Carlson sits down with Samantha Barry, editor-in-chief of Glamour.
At 3:30 p.m., former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, the founder of Powered by People, will be interviewed by Robert Costa, national political reporter for The Washington Post and moderator of Washington Week on PBS.
At 5 p.m., we close our first day with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in conversation with Joy Reid, the host of the MSNBC show “AM Joy.”
Our first conversation on Sunday the 15th is at 9:30 a.m. Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang sits down with Ben Smith, newly minted media columnist for The New York Times.
At 11 a.m., Charlotte Alter, national correspondent for TIME and the author of "The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For: How a New Generation of Leadership with Transform America," will talk with three millennials in the political and policy fray: Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo; Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the progressive political group Justice Democrats; and Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, California.
At 12:30 p.m., U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, and former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon sit down with Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic.
At 2 p.m., CNN anchor Kate Bolduan talks to four Republican mainstays turned Trump apostates: political strategists Reed Galen, Steve Schmidt and John Weaver and best-selling author Rick Wilson, all co-founders of The Lincoln Project.
At 3:30 p.m., Dylan Byers, senior media reporter for NBC and MSNBC, interviews four top-tier political reporters: Jackie Kucinich, Washington D.C. bureau chief for The Daily Beast; Olivia Nuzzi, Washington correspondent for New York Magazine; Manu Raju, senior congressional correspondent for CNN; and Jake Sherman, senior writer for Politico and co-author of Politico’s Playbook.
Finally, at 5 p.m., attorney and Brandeis University professor Anita Hill records an episode of the “Women Rule” podcast with Anna Palmer, senior Washington correspondent for Politico and co-author of Politico’s Playbook.
If you’re a Texas Tribune Festival fan or a mere political junkie, this is a weekend for you. You have to be a South by Southwest badge holder to attend. Go to sxsw.com/attend to register. See you there!

Justin Sunseri — once a “longtime Republican” — says the GOP has left him behind.
As a result, the 38-year-old software developer from Houston found himself wrestling with the sprawling Democratic field. Eventually Sunseri found a savior of sorts in Pete Buttigieg, a centrist technocrat who spent much of his time on the trail drawing explicit contrasts to his progressive rivals.
“His policies were more moderate, and I thought, frankly, he was the smoothest debater,” Sunseri said of Buttigieg. “He always looked polished, and I liked that, and I saw somebody I could get behind.”
There’s just one problem: On Sunday, days after Sunseri cast a ballot for Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, announced he is no longer running for president.
After talks with his top advisers, just 48 hours before Super Tuesday, Buttigieg shuttered his White House bid. According to The New York Times, the former mayor saw a narrow, if not impossible, path forward Tuesday, as results were widely expected to show him far behind rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
“The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close, for our candidacy if not for our cause,” Buttigieg told supporters Sunday. “Tonight I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.”
But for Sunseri, it came too late. The same is true of early voters who cast ballots for Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, both of whom also dropped out in the past 72 hours and left a sense of despair for many of their supporters who found out that their early votes for president have been, essentially, wasted.
“We need ranked-choice voting so I don’t throw my vote in the trash again,” said Sunseri, referencing an electoral model that allows voters to rank candidates by preference, listing their first-, second- and third-place choices.
It’s impossible to know how many people already voted for Buttigieg, Klobuchar or Steyer in Texas; results from early voting won’t be available until after the polls close on Super Tuesday. According to the Texas Secretary of State, about 1 million people have already cast ballots in the Democratic primary. And each candidate was working to win over voters in Texas before exiting the race.
Buttigieg, for example, was slated to hold a rally Sunday night in Dallas and a fundraiser Monday morning in Austin before he canceled both to return to South Bend last night and deliver the news of his exit. And before a disappointing third-place finish in South Carolina, Steyer held a town hall in Houston. Klobuchar was the only Democratic presidential candidate not campaigning in Texas ahead of Super Tuesday. She last visited the state in September.
(According to media reports, both Buttigieg and Klobuchar are expected Monday night to throw their support behind Joe Biden, who, after an impressive finish in South Carolina, has positioned himself as the strongest moderate alternative to stop Sanders. Biden was already scheduled to be in Dallas on Monday night for a community event after visiting Houston earlier in the day.)
Texans who voted for one of the three candidates now out of the race said they did so, in part, because of the candidates’ moderate credentials and because they saw them as the contestants most capable of ending President Donald Trump’s administration.
Krissia Palomo, a 20-year-old student, said it plainly: She was supporting Klobuchar because she felt the Minnesota senator could unite Democrats across the ideological spectrum — unlike Sanders or even Biden. She’s now supporting Elizabeth Warren, she said.
“In this election, we’re going to need to bring in moderates,” she said. “On a national stage, it’s really, really hard to energize everybody, so we need to get those people who already do go vote on a regular basis — and get the moderates and the never-Trump Republicans to be on our side.”
Zachary Petty, a 34-year-old accountant, said he liked Buttigieg because he felt the former mayor has been able to “usher in some new ideas.”
“The reason that I decided to vote for him was a combination of believing he had the best chance of winning and him being the most like me in his thinking,” he said.
Petty said he didn’t feel like his vote was wasted.
“I voted for the candidate I liked the most,” he said. “I made the best decision for me based on the information I had at the time I cast my ballot.”
Ashley Wilson, a 45-year-old digital learning coordinator, expressed similar feelings about Buttigieg.
“He’s a rational human being,” Wilson said. “He was very straightforward, and he had common sense.”
But for all the voters bowled over by the Democrats now out of the race, the warning signs were there: In one of the latest Texas polls, released by the University of Houston Hobby School of Public Affairs, Buttigieg received 11.9% support among Democratic presidential primary voters. Klobuchar earned 7.2%, and Steyer was at 1.1%. Biden, the leader, came in at 22.5%.
And despite a push from local election officials encouraging Texans to vote early, Sunseri says he won’t make the same mistake twice.
“Maybe if I’m planning to vote for the front-runner I can do so ahead of time,” Sunseri said.
If not?
“I’ll wait until election day,” he said.

Texto completo: Mary Jacqueline Leslie
Louisville - Jackie, 72, of Louisville, Kentucky, died February 27, 2020. She was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and grew up in Owensboro, Kentucky where she attended Owensboro High School. She was a wife, mother, grandmother, friend, a working woman of over five decades, a manager, and a mentor to many.
She loved to drink wine and eat good food with friends. She loved traveling, staying in fine hotels, and always sought out the best restaurants. She and her husband, Andy, spent a lot of time traveling to Boston, Seattle, Charleston, Chicago, and Vancouver. She loved to organize vacations that gathered our large extended family together for a week in the summers.
As a professional, she managed software development, technical implementations and technical support at ALLTEL/Computer Power. She held management positions that most men usually had and always took care of her staff. She made a huge impact on many peoples lives and gave opportunities to people who still thank her to this very day even many years later.
She loved reading novels and newspapers. She read every day and kept up with current events through the Sunday New York Times. She kept up with the daily crossword puzzles and read the funnies. She was into pop-culture and knew the lyrics to every popular song from the mid-fifties to the mid-eighties. She enjoyed the local arts and had season tickets to Pandora and Actors Theater. She was the president of both the Jacksonville Wine and Food Society and the Original Highlands Neighborhood Association. She also fed and cared for the local wildlife including birds, squirrels and cats much to the chagrin of her family and neighbors.
Jackie was a strong-willed woman and a fearless advocate to people of all walks of life. She always rooted for the underdog and made sure that women were treated equally. She was a woman of energy, generosity, and compassion to those she held dear. She loved and cared for all of her family dearly and always put others first before herself. She always wanted to make sure that everyone was taken care of before herself. Even in her last few days of life she was still making sure everyone got their cards and presents for birthdays and holidays all while battling liver disease. Her family was spread throughout the country, but she would make sure that everyone would get together no matter what the circumstances. She was the one who made the phone calls to stay in touch. She would also read each obituary in the local paper, the memory of each person was important.
Jackie will be terribly missed by her loving husband Andy Leslie, her two sons Josh Howes (Becky) and Jake Wooldridge, mother Becky Reynolds, brother Cary Reynolds (Gail), three step-children Erin McDonald (Perry), Emily Merton, Ken Leslie (Amanda), and two nieces Ashley Lile (Max) and Lesley Reynolds. She is also leaving behind nine grandchildren Daniel, Josh, Ariana, Lily, Hannah, Tristan, Justin, Macie, and Zoe.
A Celebration of Life will be held Sunday, March 8 at 1:00pm at The Olmsted, 3701 Frankfort Avenue. There will be a private burial in the spring at Cave Hill Cemetery. Expressions of sympathy may be made in her honor to the Senior Outreach program of Highlands Community Ministries.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg's speech Sunday night in South Bend, ending his presidential campaign, was extraordinary on so many levels.
First, it showed the youngest candidate in the field, who would have been the youngest president had he been elected, was the most mature.
He looked at his disappointing results in South Carolina, especially his inability to gain any serious traction with Black voters, and concluded there was no way he could become the Democratic nominee.
Second, it was remarkable for its nuance. He believes Democrats are heading down a road to perdition if their strategy to take out Donald Trump was to promise a social and economic revolution, i.e. Bernie Sanders.
Finally, there was this powerful fact that his warning against embracing revolutionary politics stood in such stark contrast to him embracing his husband on stage.
It wasn't that long ago that showing a man kiss another man on screen was a cultural taboo, meant to push boundaries or be outrageous. But on Sunday night, it happened as naturally as any other couple engaging in a reassuring PDA.
Buttigieg's campaign was revolutionary because he was the first openly gay person to make a serious run at the presidency. The biggest knock against him wasn't that he was gay, but that he was, at 38, relatively young and, as mayor of a small city, didn't fit the traditional profile of a presidential candidate.
But imagine: you're a gay adolescent or teenager, sitting at home, trying to figure out if or when to come out, how to tell your parents, how to tell your friends, and you watch an openly gay man say you can be anything you want, including president of the United States.
Buttigieg revealed himself not as a revolutionary but a hard-nosed Middle America pragmatist. The Bernie Bros will dismiss him as a dinosaur, but it's a DINO — Democrat In Name Only — that Buttigieg resents. He resents Sanders flying a flag of convenience and does not believe a self-described socialist from Vermont who goes around extolling the virtues of Fidel Castro stands a chance of beating Donald Trump at this point of history. Instead, like many Democrats, he looks at Bernie and sees the ghosts of Walter Mondale and George McGovern.
Buttigieg encouraged his supporters to vote instead for someone who will improve the established system, not try to destroy it. In doing so, he launched the first especially incendiary salvo in what is now an open war to save the Democratic Party from having its standard bearer be someone who isn't really a Democrat.
Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont professor and political historian, observes that historically Sanders has tried to take out Democrats, running against them at least a dozen times in previous campaigns.
Bernie Sanders is anti-Trump, but he is not the Anti-Trump. When it comes to party bonafides, they have more in common than either would care to admit.
Trump isn't and never was a real Republican. Sanders isn't and never was a real Democrat. Instead, they set out to remake those respective parties in their image. Trump has largely succeeded, making a mockery of traditional Republican principles such as balanced budgets.
Sanders, however, is now facing a party less willing to be steamrolled into being something they say they aren't.
In the end, voters will decide, just as they decided Pete Buttigieg is a nice, smart guy, but not a guy they want to be president. At least not now.
Less than 24 hours after Buttigieg pulled the plug, Senator Amy Klobuchar ended her campaign, too. She was less coy than Buttigieg, immediately endorsing Joe Biden in an effort to unify the party around a candidate whose greatest attribute for die-hard Democrats is that he isn't Bernie Sanders.
On Monday, Buttigieg and Klobuchar stood on a stage in Dallas and endorsed Biden together. In a city where the president who once epitomized the soul of the Democratic Party was murdered 57 years ago, they hoped to save their party from what they believe would be political suicide.

Texto completo: With the coming U.S. presidential election and Summer Olympics, 2020 was expected to be a good year for advertising. Then came the coronavirus.
One of the world's largest ad buyers plans to lower its forecast for global advertising spending, which is often among some of the first things cut by companies looking for short-term fixes.
As recently as December, Zenith, a Publicis Groupe SA ad-buying firm, had expected global ad spending to rise 4.3% to $666 billion this year. But on Monday, Jonathan Barnard, Zenith's head of forecasting, said that number would be revised lower in the coming weeks because of the virus.
"Obviously, we weren't expecting anything like this when we said 4.3%," Mr. Barnard said.
The New York Times Co. said it was already experiencing an impact: It cut its first-quarter advertising-revenue forecast on Monday.
"We are seeing a slowdown in international and domestic advertising bookings, which we associate with uncertainty and anxiety about the virus," New York Times Chief Executive Mark Thompson said in a regulatory filing.
The Times now expects total ad revenue to decline in the mid-teens in percentage terms this quarter, with digital advertising revenue expected to shrink 10%. It previously had been anticipating total ad revenue to drop about 10% , with digital falling in the mid-single digits.
The warning from the Times suggests that companies are beginning to rein in spending because of worries over how the spread of the coronavirus will affect consumer behavior.
A spokesman for The Wall Street Journal declined to comment. The Washington Post didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.
Media companies with large exposure to travel and retail ad dollars will likely take the brunt of the hit, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.
Some travel companies, such as airlines and cruise lines in the U.S., have already begun to cut back on spending, according to an ad buyer.
Digital advertising might be more vulnerable because digital ad spending can be canceled more easily than other media. Outdoor media companies also might be hurt, because of a decline in foot traffic in many places.
Television tends to be more resilient because campaigns are planned and booked further in advance, according to ad buyers and analysts. Many companies have already made yearlong upfront ad commitments to TV networks for this year, and only some of those commitments can be canceled.
Several TV-network ad-sales executives said they haven't seen any cancelations, but are planning for cuts.
Media and advertising companies don't just rely on ad spending for growth: Some have fairly large events businesses, which could be vulnerable as companies begin to place travel restrictions on employees.
Ad giant Interpublic Group of Cos. has experienced some pullback on its events business, said Michael Roth, Interpublic's chief executiver, during the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, on Monday. Still, Mr. Roth said he doesn't see the fallout from the virus having a material impact on the company's overall business.
Other revenue streams are less likely to be affected by virus concerns. The New York Times said Monday it has seen "no adverse impact on subscription growth, or on the expected rise in subscription revenue."
On Monday, MoffettNathanson lowered its target prices for advertising firms such as WPP PLC, Omnicom Group Inc. and Interpublic because of virus concerns.
"Given concerns around coronavirus and potential global economic weakness, we expect this very weak trend in agency growth may very well persist into 2020," Mr. Nathanson said in a note to investors.
Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence for GroupM, a WPP- owned company that buys roughly $50 billion in ad space and time for marketers around the world, said he expects ad spending in China to decline by double digits in percentage terms this quarter. He said it is unclear whether that spending will come back later in the year, and it is too early to predict what the fallout will be for other countries.

Texto completo: Teach children by example
Editor: Children learn. They have no choice. It’s a biological imperative.
They learn 24/7/365, not just during formal school hours. They learn more than just the 3 Rs; they learn both authenticity and deception. They learn both sincerity and corruption. They learn “messaging,” void of principles and ethics. They learn hate and divisiveness in many religious environments.
In the past three years, our society has demonstrated that an individual’s better character doesn’t matter if lies, bullying and threats are the most advantageous means to an end.
Children learn duplicity and manipulation more easily than math. Children learn to distrust out of necessity for safety. Children learn collectively that human rights compete with individual rights and individual rights are constitutionally protected more than their collective safety.
Girls learn that men might ultimately control their bodies, from dating peer pressures to misogynist monoliths, to restrictions of personal choice on what to do with the consequences of testosterone-guzzling power brokers, from athletes to pastors, from handsy “uncles” to the proud grabber in-chief. Boys learn that “Little Women,” “Sesame Street” and “Mister Rogers” threaten their privileges of toxic chauvinistic power and they reject the authentic power of feminist DNA.
Boys and girls learn shame is a great weapon, especially if trying to hide (and justify) their own scars. Children learn from every word, every act and inaction and every emotion.
Children learn. They have no choice. It’s a biological imperative. Step up in your vote and teach our children that what they learn matters.

CARBONDALE
Restore nation’s unity
Editor: Timothy Snyder, the Yale history professor and author of the New York Times No. 1 bestseller “On Tyranny,” recently said things we should all take to heart: “It’s horrible that these people (who have lost positions and reputations after standing up to President Trump) have faced consequences. The rest of us should feel solidarity with them, and try to make it understood that those consequences are worth something, that we hear them - that we will do something about it.
“We have a long tradition of recognizing heroes as the people who resist power,” he said, “Freedom isn’t a ride you take; it’s something you have to take hold of. A lot of us have to be willing to dissent. When a lot of us dissent, it’s no longer dissent - it’s opposition and people aren’t so lonely and more people can have courage. Because you can pick on a hundred people, but it’s a lot harder to pick on a million.”
Right on! There’s strength in numbers, and none in numbness. If all of us with eyes to see, hearts to feel and hands to join rise up together in opposition; we can slay the dragon.
We’ll do it by organizing, by marching, by protesting, by rallying, by doorbell-ringing and letter-writing and candlelight-vigiling. We’ll do it by speaking loudly and clearly to our government and gently but forcefully to our children- especially those of voting age - and then by going to the polls, en masse but as one, and restoring the United States as the land of opportunity rather than the land of opportunism. We will be a nation united and not a nation divided.
After all, we’re the United States. Our motto is “E Pluribus Unum”: “Out of many, one.”

Fund mental health needs
Editor: Gov. Tom Wolf launched a statewide initiative “Reach Out PA: Your Mental Health Matters” to expand resources and provide comprehensive support for mental health priorities statewide.
We applaud The Sunday Times Feb. 9 editorial, “Boost mental health funds,” and strongly support the governor’s goals to ensure greater access to mental health services. Northeast Pennsylvania is fortunate to have a wide range of public and private treatment providers with specialized expertise to provide timely, effective services to individuals in need.
One of the governor’s goals is to combat mental health stigma associated with mental illness. It is often a reason that individuals do not seek effective treatment because they may feel personally ashamed, isolated and hopeless.
Another objective is to integrate physical and behavioral health services. Scranton Counseling Center has been at the forefront of this service, and for several years we have maintained close working relationships with health providers to ensure the best services for our mutual clients. We also host a physical health clinic on weekdays at our downtown Scranton location.
Historically, funding for behavioral health services has been less than adequate. Some insurance programs are available, but state-mandated services and treatment for the uninsured who are not eligible for Medicaid are covered by state allocations to counties. In 2012, these community-based county funds were reduced by 10%. Those reductions affected community providers, some experiencing reductions of as much as 15%. That funding loss has continued for eight years while service delivery costs increased and additional consumers need treatment.
A top priority of the Pennsylvania County Commissioners Association this year is funding for mental health services. Community-based services ensure that the uninsured are not denied access. It’s past time to properly fund the need for increased mental health services.

Center of community
Editor: The Abington Senior Center is just a building, but to many it is a safe, clean, welcoming environment run by a friendly, competent staff.
It is a daytime home to many people who come to be creative in art classes, to grow stronger in exercise classes, to meditate, play cards and share in a midday meal or socialize with friends.
The center’s temporary closure caused much stress and discomfort in the lives of our members. Thanks to all who made the reopening possible.

Crisis costs mount
Editor: Large California corporations have contributed millions of dollars to address the homeless problem in that state.
A California official said on the “60 Minutes” TV news show that homelessness is a $30 billion problem. This issue can be solved by an incremental process, with funds from the government, bonds, charities and religious organizations.
Either that, or it will take a Superfund-type grant from the federal government to fix it.

Texto completo: Dr. Charles E. Friedgood, a wealthy Long Island, New York, surgeon imprisoned for murdering his ailing wife June 18, 1975, has died in Florida more than a decade after he was declared terminally ill with cancer and released from prison. He was 99.
His death, on May 19, 2018, was confirmed last week by his daughter, Esther Zaretsky. It had not previously been reported by his family.
While he admitted that he had injected his wife, Sophie Davidowitz Friedgood, 48, a Hazleton native, with the narcotic painkiller Demerol, Friedgood insisted that he had not intended to kill her. She had suffered a stroke in 1959, when she was 33, and had become an invalid.
Friedgood was convicted of second-degree murder in 1976, after prosecutors proved to a jury that he had deliberately given his wife an overdose at the family’s 18-room home in Great Neck, New York, where they had reared their six children.
Her cause of death was recorded as a stroke, but the police grew suspicious after Friedgood had signed the death certificate himself and rushed the body out of state - to Hazleton - for immediate burial in Agudas Israel Cemetery, in accordance with Jewish religious custom.
The following month, her body was exhumed and an autopsy performed “to finally determine the manner and cause of death,” a July 11, 1975, Standard-Speaker article stated.
He was arrested at Kennedy International Airport with more than $569,000 of his wife’s cash and negotiable bonds, as well as his wife’s jewelry. Prosecutors said he had intended to fly to Europe to join his paramour, Harriet Larsen, a Danish nurse who had sometimes cared for Sophie Friedgood and with whom he had fathered two children, the first one in 1972.
Sophie discovered what was going on when she found love letters and a nude photo of the mistress. When the truth emerged, Friedgood resorted to denial and appeasement, but neither worked.
Greed also entered the scenario. Sophie was independently wealthy, possessing stocks she received from her family.
When released from prison in December 2007, he was 89 and the oldest inmate in New York state’s correctional system, having served 31 years of his 25-years-to-life sentence.
Allowed to live with a sister in Florida, where a daughter also lives, Friedgood was residing in the West Palm Beach area at the time of his death.
Many troubles
Charles Edward Friedgood was born on Oct. 3, 1918, in Toledo, Ohio. His father, Henry, an immigrant from what was then Palestine, was a menswear salesman. His mother, Evelyn (Rubenstine) Friedgood, was born in Germany.
He studied at the University of Michigan Medical School, was said to have graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit, and then began what was described as a checkered medical career.
He was wed briefly to Geraldine Davidson, a wealthy woman from Detroit, then married Sophie Davidowitz, who also was from a well-to-do family as the daughter of Hyman and Rose Davidowitz of Hazleton. Sophie suffered a stroke in 1959, when she was 33, and became an invalid.
Charles Friedgood was no stranger to legal troubles.
He was indicted in 1964 on six counts of abortion and one of manslaughter in the death of a woman on whom he allegedly performed an illegal abortion. The charges were later dismissed.
In 1972, a business partner accused Friedgood of having him kidnapped, injecting him with barbiturates and forcing him to sign a promissory note for $510,000. A grand jury did not return an indictment in the case.
Also that year, he was convicted of understating his taxable income by more than $300,000. He got a year and a day in jail, but that sentence was suspended. His probation was due to expire July 20, 1975.
It was him violating his probation which allowed police to call back the airborne plane he was on to the airport on the day of his arrest.
Family concerns
Testimony from his children helped convict him of the murder, but his daughter Zaretsky served as his lawyer before the Parole Board.
“Did he do it?” she asked rhetorically in an interview. “That I don’t know. But he served his sentence. Under New York law, he’s entitled to be paroled.”
Friedgood’s brother-in-law, Sidney Klemow of Hazleton, demurred. “I knew he was guilty the minute it happened,” he told The New York Times in 2007. Klemow died in 2011.
Complete information on Friedgood’s survivors was not immediately available.
Earlier, in an extensive interview with The New York Times at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility in Sullivan County, New York, he was pressed on what he was expressing remorse for.
“That I didn’t take better care of her and that I should have watched and been more diligent with the injections,” he replied.
Was he glad she was dead?
“Not glad, but I felt, you know, sometimes I used to say when a person was in terminal malignancy and suffering, sometimes it’s better you die and you not suffer so much.”
He was asked how he reconciled that sentiment with what he had told the Parole Board earlier, that he had done it and was sorry.
“Well, you try; you have to try,” he replied. “You want to get out of here. You don’t want to die in prison. So you try to appeal to their mercy and forgiveness.”
What difference would it make if he died in prison?, he was asked.
“Well, I want to be buried where my parents are buried,” Friedgood replied. “We have a family plot in Detroit. In prison they put you in potter’s field.”
He was buried in South Florida National Cemetery in Lake Worth, Florida.

Texto completo: James Lipton, the multitalented familiar face who hosted "Inside the Actors Studio," has died at the age of 93, Ovation, the network that now airs the show, confirmed in a statement.
In addition to his role at the helm of the long-running series, Lipton was a prolific writer and producer. Born in Detroit, Lipton rose to the level of celebrity when he began hosting the series that also served as a class for his students at the Actors Studio, where he was dean.
“We celebrate and honor the great legacy of James Lipton," Ovation said in a statement provided by PR director Roger Lawson. "James is beloved around the world for his passion, insight, and dedication to the craft of acting. With 'Inside the Actors Studio,' James has created a long-lasting impact on the acting world. Ovation mourns his loss and offers deepest condolences to his family, friends and fans. "
As an actor, Lipton appeared most recently in the reboot of "Arrested Development, according to IMDb.
His wife, Kedakai Mercedes Lipton, told The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter he died of bladder cancer. USA TODAY has reached out to Lipton's representative for comment.
"Inside the Actors Studio" aired for more than 20 years on Bravo, premiering in 1994. Lipton interviewed Hollywood icons including Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in his time as host.
Lipton said his favorite guest on the show was Bradley Cooper, because he was a former student.
“The night that one of my students has achieved so much that he or she comes back and sits down in that chair would be the night that I have waited for since we started this thing,” Lipton told Larry King in 2016. “It turned out to be Bradley Cooper. ”
When the show announced in 2019 that it would move to Ovation, Lipton departed.
“It’s very gratifying to see the legacy of 'Inside the Actors Studio' being carried forward for a new generation to appreciate and enjoy,” Lipton told The Hollywood Reporter when he retired from the series. “I made a vow early on that we would not deal in gossip – only in craft, and Ovation, as a network dedicated to the arts, will continue that tradition with the next seasons of the series. I’m excited to see the new hosts engage with the guests and students and continue to entertain viewers in the U. S. and around the world. ”
His early acting roles included Dr. Dick Grant in "The Guiding Light" in 1953 and Michelangelo in "You Are There" that same year. But he found more success as a writer, eventually becoming head writer on "The Guiding Light. " He later worked on more than 400 episodes on the '70s series "The Doctors. "
His most recent writing credits are for two 2019 episodes of "Inside the Actors Studio. "
Bravo mainstay Andy Cohen took to Twitter to mourn Lipton, writing: "(Lipton) was a warm, meticulous man with a great appreciation of the arts and wicked sense of humor. He was the face of Bravo who delivered us one-of-a-kind interviews with a breadth of superstars. He was always so kind to me. . . when he found out how much I love Diana Ross, he insisted on taking me to see her in concert. He really cared about what he did. If you got booked on his show, it meant you’d made it, and had the talent to back it up. What a good guy. James Lipton will be missed. "
Frances Berwick, president of NBCU Lifestyle Networks, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY: “James Lipton was a titan of the film and entertainment industry and had a profound influence on so many. I had the pleasure of working with Jim for 20 years on Bravo's first original series, his pride and joy ‘Inside the Actors Studio. ’ We all enjoyed and respected his fierce passion, contributions to the craft, comprehensive research and his ability to bring the most intimate interviews ever conducted with A-list actors across generations. Bravo and NBCUniversal send our deepest condolences to Jim's wife Kedakai and all his family. “
Lipton's time in the limelight was not totally free of controversy. He memorably raised eyebrows when revealed in a 2013 interview with Parade that he was a pimp in the 1950s.
"It was only a few years after the war," he said in the 2013 interview. "Paris was different then, still poor. Men couldn't get jobs and, in the male chauvinist Paris of that time, the women couldn't get work at all. It was perfectly respectable for them to go into le milieu. "

Texto completo: Teen climate celebrity Greta Thunberg inspired thousands of British children to skip school on Friday and protest global warming. Unfortunately the young activists damaged the treasured green space where they chose to rally. Residents are hopeful that their resilient local environment will stage a robust ecological recovery.
The BBC reports :
Around 15,000 people are believed to have attended Friday's Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate rally, churning up College Green and angering many...
The combination of thousands of people and heavy rain turned much of the grass into mud, angering some.
Ms. Thunberg has been presented as a sort of expert on the environment by alleged adults in the international press. The 17-year-old Swede has been urging young people around the world to temporarily abandon their classrooms to attend public demonstrations like the one in Bristol. In an otherwise favorable report on Friday's event, the New Zealand Herald noted the impact of all those little feet as well as the energy-consuming devices in all those little hands:
As the rain poured down, transforming parts of the ground into a mudbath and lending the event a soggy festival vibe, chants of "Greta! Greta!" filled the air.
Thousands of mobile phones were raised above heads, like a salute, to honour the moment.
John Varga writes in the Express that when the BBC "posted pictures of a brown, muddy trampled College Green lawn after the crowds had dispersed, furious locals took to Twitter to accuse Ms Thunberg of hypocrisy and having scant regard for the environment." Adds Mr. Varga:
One wrote: "College Green is a popular place, it has been totally trashed, but do not put all the blame on the rain.
"It will cost thousands to lay more grass and make it beautiful again.
"Hope you are happy Greta and enjoyed the chaos you and your followers caused."
Another fumed: "Destroyed the grass which absorbs greenhouse gases in the centre of Bristol."
In the Mail on Sunday, Holly Bancroft describes Bristol's College Green as "a sacred site throughout the Middle Ages". Ms. Bancroft credits Ms. Thunberg for "a rousing speech about the need to reduce the world's carbon footprint" but adds that "her supporters' footprints did little to preserve the city's famous lawn – in fact, they turned it into a muddy eyesore."
***
Meanwhile across the Atlantic, students on one U.S. college campus were staging their own somber gathering. But this event focused on a local rather than a global concern. Michael Sneff writes for the Daily Collegian, the student newspaper at Penn State:
A crowd of Penn State students and State College community members gathered Sunday night to collectively mourn the closing of the Taco Bell, located at 310 E. College Ave.
"Taco Bell is not gone, it is not forgotten, but it lives here, in our sauce packets," student Kevin Victor (junior-computer science) said.
Mr. Sneff reports that the vigil was organized by Penn State student Prajesh Patel, who appeared in a taco costume. Adds Mr. Sneff:
"We were all shooketh after hearing about the closing of this beautiful, beautiful State College establishment," Patel (senior-computer science) said to the crowd. "Taco Bell was our home away from home, and added spice to our life."
He said he will miss the food during late nights, but will miss the conversations he had at the establishment more, saying he met many of his current friends there.
According to the compelling dispatch in the Collegian:
George Miller and Juliana Windhorst, who both worked at the location for over a year, said it was "disheartening" to see the location close but said they were moved by the support from the community...
Miller, who was a manager at the location, was the person who closed the doors for the final time.
"My reaction was honestly surprised, and it didn't really affect me until I, as a manager, closed the doors for the last time," Miller said. "I think [the vigil] was necessary, because I think it had a place in many people's hearts, to see the store closing it felt as if somebody that was loved, died."
Windhorst shared similar sentiments.
"It was saddening to me, I know I'm going to miss all of the college students even though it did get crazy on those Friday and Saturday nights," Windhorst said. "But it was heartwarming to me to see all these people here, knowing that they actually loved the store, and that they actually cared."
For students upset that local adults may have dared to steal their dreams of late-night dining, Mr. Sneff offers encouraging news:
Other Taco Bell locations in the State College area include stores at 397 Benner Pike and 100 Rolling Ridge Drive. A new location at 1909 N. Atherton St. is set to open this summer.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden got a boost ahead of the Super Tuesday nomination contests when Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg gave him their endorsements Monday after ending their own White House bids.
Fresh off a huge win in South Carolina, Biden seeks to position himself as the most viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Democratic front-runner who is running on a progressive agenda that includes a "Medicare for All" proposal and a plan to erase student debt.
Buttigieg and Klobuchar each flew to Dallas on Monday. Biden was scheduled to hold a rally there on the eve of Super Tuesday. At stake in Texas are 228 delegates – the third-most delegates available in the Democratic nominating contest. On Tuesday, 14 states will determine one-third of the pledged delegates – 1,344 out of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in November.
Sanders has led polling averages in the biggest prize of California: 415 delegates are up for grabs. The Vermont senator, who held the most delegates heading into Tuesday, tweeted Monday that he doesn't believe "we will defeat Donald Trump with a candidate like Joe Biden who supported the Iraq War. "
But many moderate Democrats and establishment party figures feared that if Sanders, a Democratic socialist, won the nomination, he wouldn't be able to attract the broad coalition the party needs to beat Trump. Biden has criticized Sanders' plans such as "Medicare for All" and erasing student debt as too costly.
Another wild card is that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will begin appearing on ballots Tuesday after spending $539 million through Thursday to blanket the country with advertising.
To combat Sanders' grassroots campaign and Bloomberg's advertising, Biden spent Monday collecting high-profile endorsements, including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid called Biden the "best able" to defeat Trump.
Austin Mayor Steve Adler, who earlier endorsed Buttigieg, threw his support Monday behind Biden, saying "it's time for the party to consolidate. "
The twin departures of Klobuchar and Buttigieg in less than 24 hours offered Biden an opportunity to unite moderate voters behind his candidacy.
Klobuchar pitched herself as a moderate with Midwestern appeal and the political "grit. " She enjoyed a boomlet after the New Hampshire primary, where a surprise third-place finish gave her a needed fundraising boost and fresh political momentum. Klobuchar said the New Hampshire results showed she could beat expectations and build a broad coalition, as she had in her Senate races.
"I defied expectations, and I won. And I have done it over and over again in the reddest of red districts and the bluest of blue districts,” she told supporters in New Hampshire.
But her "Klomentum" seemed to evaporate as quickly as it emerged. She garnered only 3% of the vote in Saturday's South Carolina primary, a result that all but closed off her path to the nomination.
Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, was one of the few military veterans in the race. He also offered academic credentials as a Rhodes Scholar with degrees from Harvard University and the University of Oxford who speaks multiple languages. He inspired unity and inclusiveness as an openly gay candidate.
But after winning the Iowa caucuses, he found it difficult to gain traction with younger voters and placed a disappointing fourth Saturday in South Carolina. In his departure speech Sunday in South Bend, Buttigieg said he would "do everything in my power to ensure that we have a new Democratic president come January. ”
Time to vote: When are the 2020 presidential election primaries?
Klobuchar invested most of her time and money in Iowa, where she finished in fifth place, and New Hampshire, where she snagged nearly 20% of the vote.
But just a few days after the New Hampshire primary, Klobuchar stumbled during an interview with Telemundo when asked if she could name the president of Mexico. "No," she responded in a lapse that came back to haunt her during the pivotal Feb. 18 Democratic debate.
And the New Hampshire bounce was not enough to help her campaign scale up as the race moved to Nevada and South Carolina. She finished sixth in the Nevada caucuses.
Klobuchar's rivals, including Biden and Sanders, were far better organized in those two states. And they enjoyed broader support among Latino and African-American voters, key constituencies she was unable to win over.
Klobuchar, 59, has been the senior U. S. senator from Minnesota since 2007 and is the state’s first female senator. She launched her campaign in the middle of a snowstorm on the Mississippi River shore.
"I don't come from money," Klobuchar said as snow piled on the crowd. "But what I do have is this: I have grit. I have family. I have friends. I have neighbors. I have all of you who are willing to come out in the middle of the winter, all of you who took the time to watch us today from home, all of you who are willing to stand up and say people matter. "
Klobuchar cast herself as the best alternative to liberals in the race, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, touting her Midwestern roots and her ability to work across the aisle to get things done in the Senate.
"I'm someone that can win and beat Donald Trump," she said during the first primary debate last year. "I have won every place, every race, and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa and in Michigan. "
On some progressive policies, such as “Medicare for All” and access to free college, Klobuchar differed from her more progressive counterparts.
On the campaign trail, Klobuchar at times had to contend with reporting that dubbed her one of the “worst bosses” in Congress, a designation Politico gave her in 2018.
Opinion: Klobuchar's bad-boss flaws are disturbing. Should Democrats write her off?
The New York Times in 2019 reported multiple cases of her “unethical” conduct as an employer in February. Among the claims: Klobuchar was known to “throw objects in frustration, including binders and phones, in the direction of aides. ” In one notorious anecdote, Klobuchar reportedly ate her salad with a comb when an aide failed to bring her a fork.
“Yes, I can be tough, and yes, I can push people,” Klobuchar told reporters after initial allegations circulated. “I have high expectations for myself. I have high expectations for the people that work for me. But I have high expectations for this country. ”

Texto completo: Dear reader,
In the rough and tumble of political journalism, respect can be a casualty. And so it was Feb. 25 in India, when President Donald Trump and CNN’s Jim Acosta clashed at a press conference.
Mr. Acosta had said, in response to criticism, that his network was better at “delivering the truth” than the president. Later that day Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, said he was “horrified” by the CNN correspondent’s behavior.
“It’s not our job to get in fights with the president,” Mr. Wallace said at an event at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in New York. “It’s not our job to one-up presidents.”
The other panelist on stage, New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, agreed.
It was a “common ground” moment at the event, sponsored by an organization devoted to bringing “light, not heat” to public discourse, the Common Ground Committee.
I was delighted to moderate the Feb. 25 panel, titled “Finding Common Ground on Facts, Fake News, and the Media.” Mr. Wallace and Ms. Haberman are two of the best in the business. But I didn’t imagine there would be much conflict to resolve. After all, they’re both news reporters, not partisans.
I soon learned that, in the public sphere, they are often associated with the political leanings of their outlets’ opinion departments – liberal at the Times and, at Fox, not just conservative but sometimes closely linked to President Trump.
Indeed, Mr. Wallace said that he’s often called upon to answer for Fox’s prime-time lineup (Sean Hannity et al.) – more so, he surmised, than Ms. Haberman is with regard to the Times’ opinion pages. She agreed.
Mr. Wallace spoke of a “firewall” between news and opinion at Fox. Still, I pointed out, the two do clash at times. News anchor Shepard Smith crossed swords with Mr. Hannity, and eventually resigned. Mr. Wallace himself recently told conservative Fox contributor Katie Pavlich, on the air, to “get her facts straight.”
“That wasn’t my best moment,” Mr. Wallace acknowledged. But he also made clear that his “marching orders” from Fox News are to “tell it straight, not to push an agenda, not to pull punches.”
On the fundamentals of news reporting, the two panelists agree. There’s also no doubt that covering the norm-breaking Trump presidency comes with unique challenges – including how to deal with Twitter.
On that, Ms. Haberman and Mr. Wallace part ways. She’s an avid tweeter. He doesn’t even have an account. But they’ve each been attacked by Mr. Trump on Twitter, and have each responded. Ms. Haberman says she regrets it every time. Mr. Wallace, in contrast, recounted a response to the president he rather liked.
“One of us has daddy issues, and it’s not me,” he said, an allusion to his late father, the legendary Mike Wallace of CBS’s “60 Minutes.”
I encourage you to watch the event video, found here. Audience questions were excellent, including many from journalism students.

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar ended her Democratic presidential campaign on Monday and plans to endorse rival Joe Biden in an effort to unify moderate voters behind the former vice president's White House bid.
She is flying to Dallas and plans to join Biden at his rally Monday night, according to her campaign.
Klobuchar was the third presidential candidate to drop out of the race in less than 49 hours, following Pete Buttigieg’s departure late Sunday and Tom Steyer's exit late Saturday. Their decisions reflect an urgent push among moderates to consolidate behind Biden as a counter to progressive rival Bernie Sanders.
Klobuchar outlasted several better-known and better-funded Democrats, thanks to a better-than-expected third-place finish in in New Hampshire. But she couldn't turn that into success elsewhere, as she struggled to build out a campaign that could compete across the country and had poor showings in the next contests.
The three-term senator had one of this cycle's more memorable campaign launches, standing outside in a Minnesota snowstorm last February to tout her “grit” and Midwestern sensibilities. Klobuchar argued that her record of getting things done in Washington and winning even in Republican parts of her state would help her win traditionally Democratic heartland states like Wisconsin and Michigan that flipped in 2016 to give Donald Trump the presidency.

2020 Watch: How long will Joe Biden's moment last?
She was hoping to own the moderate lane of a Democratic field that grew to some two dozen candidates. But that got much tougher when Biden joined the race in April, starting as a front-runner and remaining there. Klobuchar also was quickly overshadowed by Buttigieg, a fellow Midwesterner who shot from being the largely unknown mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to a top contender on a mix of intelligence, strong oratory and youthful optimism. Buttigieg dropped out on Sunday, saying he no longer had a viable path to the nomination. He has not endorsed anyone.
Klobuchar entered the race with low name recognition compared with many of her rivals, a disadvantage she was still citing a year into her campaign. Outside Minnesota, the lawyer and former prosecutor was best known for her questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
Klobuchar asked Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexually assaulting a fellow teenager when both were in high school, if he ever had so much to drink that he didn't remember what happened. Kavanaugh retorted, “Have you?” Klobuchar continued, unruffled, and Kavanaugh later apologized to the senator, whose father is recovering from alcoholism.
Even before she got into the race, Klobuchar was hit with news stories claiming she mistreated her Senate staff, and she had a higher-than-usual turnover rate in her office. Klobuchar said she is a “tough boss” but countered that she has several longtime employees, including the manager of her presidential campaign.
She also face questions over her prosecutor past. In January, The Associated Press published a story about Klobuchar's office in Minneapolis having prosecuted the case of a black teenager accused of the 2002 shooting death of an 11-year-old girl. Klobuchar has cited the story to show her toughness on crime. But an AP/APM Reports investigation uncovered new evidence and myriad inconsistencies, raising questions about whether Myon Burrell was railroaded by police. The issue followed Klobuchar on the campaign trail, with protesters forcing her to cancel a rally in suburban Minneapolis days before Super Tuesday.
Klobuchar campaigned on her productivity in Washington, where she led more than 100 bills that were signed into law. And she criticized the more liberal candidates in the field, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Sanders, for running on promises she said they couldn't keep.
Rather than advocate for “Medicare for All,” for example, Klobuchar favored expanding the Affordable Care Act and working to reduce prescription drug costs — changes she said had a chance of passing and would make a significant impact. She supported making community colleges free but said she wouldn't promise to do the same for four-year colleges and universities because the U.S. cannot afford it.
“I've got to tell the truth,” she said during a CNN town hall at a college campus, where she acknowledged her position may be unpopular with younger voters.
Klobuchar was one of the first candidates to outline a plan for addressing addiction and mental health, an issue she described as personal because of her father's longtime struggle. Her accounts of growing up with a father suffering from alcoholism and watching him be forced to choose between prison or treatment were some of the most compelling moments of speeches, interviews and discussions with voters. Klobuchar said that her father described getting help as being “pursued by grace” and that it's an opportunity all people fighting addiction deserve.
But Klobuchar couldn't match her top competitors in fundraising. She raised about $11 million in the last quarter of 2019 — roughly half of what Sanders and Buttigieg received. The lack of finances early on in the campaign meant Klobuchar wasn't able to expand her operation on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire until months after her rivals. She then scrambled to put an operation in place in Nevada, South Carolina and the 14 states that will vote on Super Tuesday.
Still, there were bright spots, including strong debate performances that helped bring in new donors. Her campaign credited Klobuchar's showing in a debate days before the New Hampshire primary with helping her clinch a better-than-expected third place in the state's primary, topping Warren and Biden. Klobuchar said she raised $12 million in the next week.
During one debate she addressed sexism in the campaign, questioning whether a woman with Buttigieg's experience would qualify for the stage. She also pushed back at fears of a female candidacy, saying, “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi does it every day.”
In January, she earned endorsements from The New York Times, which also endorsed Warren, and the Quad-City Times, one of Iowa's largest newspapers. But Klobuchar was sidelined for much of the last few weeks before the Iowa caucuses when she — along with fellow candidates Warren, Sanders and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado — was stuck in Washington for the Senate impeachment trial.
She continued to rack up endorsements even as her campaign struggled, getting the backing of newspapers including the Houston Chronicle, The Seattle Times and the New Hampshire Union Leader.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Amtrak Chief Executive Richard Anderson is stepping down after three years and will be replaced by the former CEO of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc., which leases passenger charters and cargo aircraft, the railroad announced Monday.
William J. Flynn led Atlas for 13 years, retiring in 2019. At Amtrak, he succeeds another former aviation executive, Mr. Anderson, who came to the railroad in 2017 after a career running passenger carriers, including Delta Air Lines Inc.
Mr. Flynn will be the third straight Amtrak CEO hired from the private sector, as the railroad's board continues an effort to turn around the government-owned railroad's finances while improving service and safety.
Atlas subsidiaries operate the largest fleet of Boeing 747 freighter jets in the world, according to corporate filings, and supply aircraft for major shippers like Amazon.com Inc. and DHL, as well as the U.S. military.
Mr. Flynn's hiring was earlier reported by the New York Times.
In an interview, Anthony Coscia, the chairman of Amtrak's board of directors, said that Mr. Flynn's success in operating Atlas Air over the past decade gave the board confidence that he could continue Mr. Anderson's track record, in which Amtrak has recorded the best financial results in its nearly 50 year history.
Mr. Coscia also said that Mr. Flynn is expected to have a longer tenure than Mr. Anderson and his predecessor, Charles "Wick" Moorman, the former Norfolk Southern CEO, who was hired in 2016.
Both Mr. Moorman and Mr. Anderson made short-term commitments to lead the railroad, Mr. Coscia said, and served without pay. Mr. Flynn will earn a salary of $475,000 and is expected to stay on for at least five years, Mr. Coscia said.
"Bill's expectation is that he will have a longer tenure," Mr. Coscia said. "He's now got the baton for the anchor leg here, which will be longer."
Mr. Anderson is slated to stay on with Amtrak as a senior adviser through the end of the year, the railroad said.
Under Mr. Anderson, Amtrak has taken pains to emphasize its greater financial performance. The CEO and the board that the railroad would have greater credibility when seeking large capital grants from Congress if it could show it spent its annual subsidies responsibly.
Mr. Flynn inherits a corporate strategy of improving performance and earnings on the busy Northeast Corridor, while seeking approval and funding from Congress to establish similar multi-city corridors of frequent service in the fastest-growing areas around the country.
But the railroad faces significant resistance to those plans, including from members of Congress who don't want to see traditional long-distance routes curtailed in favor of more frequent inter-city trains. And in most areas outside the Northeast, Amtrak relies on tracks owned and controlled by freight railroads, which could prove an obstacle to the corridors of service Mr. Anderson envisioned.
Mr. Flynn has sparred with organized labor in the past. He departed Atlas after a lengthy effort to secure a new labor agreement with some of the company's pilots, a deal that Atlas has yet to close.

Leon to take over as Knicks' president today, source says

Texto completo: Sunday was business as usual at the practice facility. Monday at the Garden will be a different story.
Despite a report from the New York Times that Leon Rose would become Knicks president on March 1, he wasn't present after practice and hadn't yet spoken with the team. A source told the Daily News said Rose will instead take over Monday, the same day the Knicks host the Rockets.
It's unclear how the Knicks will handle his rollout, or if they'll even hold a press conference. No member of the Knicks front office has spoken since November, despite the removals of the head coach (David Fizdale), team president (Steve Mills) and the trading of their best player (Marcus Morris).
Rose, the longtime power agent, is inheriting a roster mixed with players who can become free agents in the summer and young prospects. Of course, Rose has no ties to any of them as an executive. He didn't sign Julius Randle or draft RJ Barrett or trade for Dennis Smith Jr., etc. Theoretically then, he'd be quicker to move on from these players.
It's all up in the air.
Barrett, the third overall pick from June, is awaiting the next step while trying to keep his focus off the constant turnover.
"When (Rose) comes in, I'm just going to have to see what he wants, see what he wants to do, see what his direction is, and follow it," Barrett said.
Ntilikina, the eighth overall pick in 2017, will play under his third team president with Rose. The next coach - assuming interim Mike Miller is replaced - will represent Ntilikina's fourth.
"It's tough, whatever, it's tough. Whatever happens it's going to be tough," Ntilikina said. "If you want to succeed in this league you've got to fight adversity. A lot of things are going to happen in an NBA season all over the league, with every team. So I think you've got to be ready for everything."
MITCHELL MUM ON AGENT SWITCH
Mitchell Robinson switched representation last month and signed with Rich Paul, the prominent agent who also represents LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons.
Paul, it should be noted, has a complicated history with Rose. They worked together at CAA - with Rose serving as something of a mentor - before Paul left to form Klutch Sports. James then left Rose to join Klutch Sports. JR Smith did the same a few years later.
Robinson, who is eligible for a contract extension in the summer, did not want to explain why he signed with Paul.
"It was just something I made up," he said. "I don't really want to say the wrong thing so I'll leave it at that."
Robinson works out in the summer with the Lakers' Anthony Davis, who is also a Paul client. Still, Robinson said that had nothing to do with his decision.
WISH GRANTED
The Knicks helped a Duke fan get his wish.
Through the MSG's charity Garden of Dreams and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Knicks arranged for Antonio Sellers - a 16-year-old diagnosed with brain cancer - to meet former Blue Devil RJ Barrett after practice Sunday.
Sellers will also attend the Duke-UNC basketball game on March 3 at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
"It really just makes you appreciate life," Barrett said after meeting Sellers. "And just to be able to see him out there and he's happy to be here. Whatever we can do to make somebody feel better, that's what we can do."
Sellers is a student at Hudson Catholic in Jersey City and played basketball at the school.

Wall Street worries about financial future of fossil fuels Another Viewpoint

Texto completo: Here's progress for you: Wall Street is suddenly turning against fossil fuels.
A recently leaked report from investment bank titan JP Morgan states, "Although precise predictions are not possible, it is clear that the Earth is on an unsustainable trajectory. Something will have to change at some point if the human race is going to survive."
The culprit, according to the JP Morgan study, as reported in The Guardian, is clearly the burning of fossil fuels - oil, gas and coal - that produce the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet.
JP Morgan's study follows January's announcement by BlackRock, the world's largest investment fund manager, that it will begin to divest its massive investments in oil companies such as Exxon Mobil, BP and Shell and look toward renewable energy.
"In the near future - and sooner than most anticipate - there will be a significant reallocation of capital," wrote BlackRock chief Larry Fink in a letter to investors.
And just this week, The New York Times reported that the Canadian government is pulling its support for the controversial expansion of oil sands mining in Alberta because, among other reasons, investors are skeptical over the profitability of the oil extraction project.
"The financial sector plays a central role in shaping our energy future so it's significant that JP Morgan Chase - the largest investor in fossil fuels - has come to terms with the growing economic risk of an increasingly warming planet," wrote Susan Glickman, Florida Director for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "Climate science is telling financiers that carbon intensive industries are dicey long-term investments."
Just as the massive decline in coal burning in U.S. power plants was brought about by economic factors, the market is also starting to work against continued growth in oil and natural gas.
"Yes, this is exactly what should be happening now," University of Miami professor Harold Wanless wrote in an email to The Invading Sea.
"It would have been better if we had done this 30 years ago, but the economics were not really there then. Now it is affordable, even cheaper, to switch to wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal and cautiously nuclear."
There have been head fakes in the past - times when it seemed that alternative energies were on the cusp of mass acceptance. Could this just be another spike in interest, to be followed by continued growth in fossil fuel extraction and burning?
Glickman doesn't think so. She notes that huge investment firms like JP Morgan don't change business strategies quickly; that the breakthroughs in low-cost solar and wind power are real and attracting sizeable investments; and ongoing improvements in and acceptance of electric cars and trucks cannot be turned back.
"The question is: Can we move society quickly enough to cut back on burning fossil fuels and hold the sea-level rise to two or three feet and adapt?" she said. "Otherwise, we're in trouble."
John Burr has more than 30 years experience as an editor and reporter in Northeast Florida, and is a member of the Jacksonville chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby.
"The Invading Sea" is the opinion arm of the Florida Climate Reporting Network, a collaborative of news organizations across the state focusing on the threats posed by the warming climate.

Trump's cuts to health agencies will haunt us Op-Ed

Texto completo: We've suddenly leaped into a real-life thriller movie where the scientists are frantically and futilely warning about a pandemic and the political leaders are pooh-poohing it, determined to squelch fear that might hurt business.
One of Donald Trump's potentially most fateful acts as president in 2018 was firing the scientist in charge of preparing for a pandemic - a disease that sweeps the globe too fast to be contained - and axing the global health team. Unpersuaded that he might face a global disease catastrophe, this year Trump is proposing a 16% cut in the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and a $3 billion cut for the National Institutes for Health.
We're about to pay the price. The CDC says it is not a question of whether the United States will be hit by the COVID-19 but when. Most likely caused by a bat illegally slaughtered at a food market in Wuhan, China, the virus has infected 78,000 people in China but is now spreading faster outside that country than inside it. The virus apparently has a 2% fatality rate, although that might prove to be a little lower or higher once the virus has run its course.
Even as U.S. scientists were warning that this virus is spreading alarmingly fast in Asia and Europe, frantic investors began dumping stock, causing the market to plummet. Trump's initial reaction was to ignore the scientists and insist everything was "under control" because at that point there were only 60 U.S. cases.
The White House asked Congress for $2.5 billion; Democrats said government scientists say the figure should be $8.5 billion. Trump said he is having a State Department specialist oversee the virus along with Vice President Mike Pence.
Emphasizing that regular influenza outbreaks have killed more than 300,000 Americans in the last decade, Trump insisted stopping all people from China coming into the U.S. has worked, even though the virus is now in 40-plus countries. "We are very, very ready for this," he insisted.
But we haven't gotten clear-cut answers yet as to how the government will stop the virus when it starts to spread in this country. Will schools and businesses close? How about mass transit? Will we be like cities in China that have virtually shut down?
The key, as always, is to find the virus's vulnerabilities and develop a vaccine. That takes time, dedication and money.
Meanwhile, we have to act responsibly. Fevers and dry coughs should be treated seriously. If you have been exposed to the virus, take precautions immediately because it can be spread before there are symptoms.
All this shows the importance of not lying to the American people. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. We were told the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico wasn't bad, but it was catastrophic. We were told Muslims from seven countries must be banned from the U.S. because terrorists were flooding into the country and committing terrorist acts. That was not true. Trump said Hillary Clinton won by 2.9 million votes in 2016 because undocumented immigrants voted illegally. That was not true. We were assured by a president with a black pen that the path of a hurricane was different from what it was.
This presidential tendency to play with the truth has happened more than 16,000 times. Initially, Trump tried to make us believe that the coronavirus is a media myth. By reducing resources put in place to deal with such threats as Ebola, against all advice, he endangered us.
At a time like this, the president's profligate predilection for prevarication is frightening. Conspiracy theories multiply like droplets from a sneeze. People either panic without reason or refuse to take any precautions, scoffing unreasonably at all authority.
Eventually, the virus will peter out. Business will resume normal operations. Travel will return. The stock market optics will change.
It is to be hoped that we will not forget that we were lied to and manipulated at a potentially treacherous time. It is to be hoped that we will not forget that the president tried to shut down science in his impossible quest to go back to the past.
There are other lessons here: Don't panic, listen to the experts - not self-serving politicians with a history of denying facts, don't discriminate against Chinese who have nothing to do with the virus, thoroughly wash your hands.
And even the scariest movie always ends.

Texto completo: Three years ago, a new hotel announced plans to rise in Louisville's once-blighted NuLu neighborhood. The plans included a novel funding source — wealthy foreign investors.
The $43 million, 156-room AC Hotel by Marriott was going to rely, in part, on money from the Bluegrass International Fund, which was set up in 2014 to take advantage of a federal program known as EB-5. At the time, the program awarded green cards in exchange for a minimum $500,000 investment, often in real estate.
Michael Mountjoy, the Bluegrass International Fund's chairman and co-founder of the accounting firm Mountjoy Chilton Medley, told The Courier Journal he saw it as a way to attract up to as much as $200 million to Kentucky, a state "so desperate for capital."
But what appeared to be a promising avenue for luring new investors to the area is today looking increasingly like a missed opportunity for Louisville and the state as a whole.
The Bluegrass International Fund failed to raise the full amount it had originally sought to secure for the NuLu project, though the hotel was "satisfied" with the amount it received, said Mountjoy, who declined to provide specific numbers. The hotel did not respond to a request for comment.
The fund is now "parked" and no longer seeking investors for other Kentucky projects, CEO Lynn Allen told The Courier Journal.
What's to blame? Allen and Mountjoy point to a system that The New York Times has reported benefited big city real estate developers, including President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, over those in Middle America.
Federal reforms that went into effect in November don't do enough to level the playing field, according to the Bluegrass International Fund.
Until last year, a foreign investor seeking permanent residency in the United States could pour $500,000 into a project that created 10 new jobs and receive a green card. That is, he or she could, as long as the project was in a rural area or distressed urban area — what the EB-5 program refers to as "targeted employment area." If the project wasn't in such an area, the minimum investment required was $1 million.
Because it was up to individual states to define these targeted employment areas, widespread gerrymandering ensued to ensure projects qualified for the lower amount, thus making them more attractive to investors.
That's how, for example, a $25 billion luxury development on Manhattan's fashionable West Side was judged to be in a distressed area. New York's economic development authority tacked on enough poor census tracts to the wealthy ones to make it look like the West Side development was in serious need of assistance, CityLab reported in April.
Such gerrymandering made it "really hard" for Kentucky to compete, Allen said. That's not to mention the vast resources those developers brought to bear.
"I would go to a fundraising conference overseas, and I would have my 8.5-by-11 pitch book," Allen recalled. "These guys would have a cinematic movie and they'd pay for fancy cocktail parties and all that. So it was a lot to compete against."
The foreign money Mountjoy had hoped to bring to Kentucky was instead sucked up by major cities and developers, he said.
"We were left out in the cold," Mountjoy said. "Not just us. Most of the central part of the country — rural areas that realistically the program was built to service."
After years of lobbying Congress, funds like Mountjoy's finally got the federal government to enact some EB-5 program reforms last year.
To stop the gerrymandering, the federal government stripped states of their power to define their own targeted employment areas and gave it instead to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
The investment thresholds also rose to $900,000 from $500,000 for those distressed areas, and to $1.8 million outside such areas, up from $1 million.
The latter change means the incentive for investors to pursue projects in places like Kentucky is greatly reduced, Mountjoy said.
And the federal government failed to address the "biggest elephant in the room," Allen said.
Each year, the number of visas issued through the EB-5 program is capped at about 10,000 and shared among applicants from different countries. No country can receive more than 7%, or about 700 visas, though unused visas meant for other countries are redistributed.
That has resulted in waiting times of up to 16 years in China, where the program has found the most popularity, Bloomberg Law reported in May.
Where there isn't a backlog, the wait can be as little as 18 months to receive a temporary visa, plus another two to three years to receive a permanent one, Allen said.
The Bluegrass International Fund sought investors in countries without backlogs, but drumming up business in new markets proved too costly.
"We tried to raise money in Peru, for example, and it was a very steep hill to climb," Allen said. "We came up empty."
To make Kentucky more attractive to foreign investors, the Bluegrass International Fund tried to enlist the help of U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Kentucky Republicans.
The fund wanted the lawmakers to support, for example, "set asides" for projects like the NuLu hotel that would allow foreign investors to cut the EB-5 visa line and qualify for expedited processing. Mountjoy also suggested designating the entire state as a "targeted employment area" given a median household income here that puts Kentucky in the bottom 10 in the nation in 2017.
In the past, Paul has proposed increasing the number of EB-5 visas available and exempting a foreign investor's spouse and children from counting as separate visas, both reforms the fund supports.
Paul, who did not respond to a request for comment, opposed the recent changes to the EB-5 program.
McConnell declined to respond to The Courier Journal's repeated requests for comment on the matter.
Mountjoy said he wishes he could raise foreign money for projects like a proposed Red River Gorge resort, but without needed reforms, the fund will likely remain parked.
"I can't say I'm terribly optimistic," he said.
The fund's CEO put it more bluntly.
"It's a sad illustration of mismanagement by the U.S. government, including Congress," Allen said. "Every year they say they are going to address some of these issues and every year they can't come to a compromise and address them."

Don't trade away our rights to the Taliban

Texto completo: Afghan women have been working to build peace for decades. We have spent years fighting for basic rights and, over the past year, for a seat at the table in talks between the United States and the Taliban. We are not reassured by the agreement signed Saturday by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban's Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, or by the process that led up to it.
This is a critical moment for our country. The window of opportunity to ensure that all Afghans are protected in the next phase of the peace talks is narrow. Despite the significant progress made in women's political participation in Afghanistan, Afghan women still face huge obstacles.
For a start, Afghan women and representatives from civil society and other minority groups should have been at the table for the U.S.-Taliban talks that led to this agreement, but we were not. History has shown us that women and minorities stand to lose the most from any deal made behind closed doors and by a room full of men.
Saturday's agreement lays the groundwork for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. We were not surprised to read recently that while Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani is tired of bloodshed and war, he opposes preconditions to these talks. Instead of guaranteeing to protect the provisions in the Afghan Constitution that grant women equality, he suggested in a New York Times op-ed that this issue can be resolved through "consensus among Afghans."
This is doublespeak for reopening peace negotiations on the hard-won legal rights that Afghanistan's women have secured through years of blood, sweat and tears. We have faced unimaginable odds and made enormous sacrifices in our battle for basic rights and freedoms.
Desperate for peace
More than 100,000 Afghans have been injured or killed in the past 10years since the United Nations began systematic documentation of civilian casualties, and there is not a single Afghan citizen whose life has not been affected by this war.
Afghan women are desperate for an end to the violence and a durable peace, but we fear that negotiators will trade away our rights for a deal. Just last week, in order to preserve its own negotiations with the Taliban, the United States signaled President Ashraf Ghani to delay his second-term inauguration, and he did.
How can we expect the Taliban and the warlords to treat us as equals when the lead negotiators have refused to give us a seat at the table? We know from experience that without a seated, elected, inclusive government based on the results of the elections, this peace deal will be little more than a division of power and resources among the Taliban, the warlords and the political strongmen.
Women and girls make up about half of the Afghan population, and 64% of the population is under the age of 25. A sustainable peace simply cannot be built without us.
On Sunday, more than 40 Afghan civil society organizations from across the country released an open letter calling for "an Afghan-owned, Afghan-led and Afghan-maintained peace." Their demands are clear: Elected representatives must lead the negotiations, the constitution must be preserved and efforts must be made to reduce violence across the country.
Our rights are nonnegotiable
The new U.S.-Taliban agreement and the ensuing intra-Afghan negotiations must address our rights in specific terms, not broad generalizations. Preserving the constitutional rights of women and all Afghan citizens must be a nonnegotiable demand on the agenda of every political party and group.
Any peace deal, if it is to succeed, will have to include the protection of our human and civil rights, including freedom of speech and religion, the right to assembly, protection for our human rights defenders, and a mechanism of restorative justice for the hundreds of thousands of victims of this long war.
Afghan women are not asking anyone to grant us our rights. Our rights are clearly enshrined in our country's constitution, our national laws, international law and sharia law.
Our message to Mr. Haqqani and other Taliban negotiators is simple: Our rights are guaranteed, and we have a right to sit at any table you do.

A change of pace One City winner altered plans for Japanese race amid coronavirus worries

Texto completo: NEWPORT NEWS - The first male runner to cross the finish line in Sunday's One City Marathon had not planned to run in Newport News.
Sean Welleck, a computer science doctoral student at New York University, was a late addition to the lineup. He had signed up for next week's Lake Biwa Marathon in Japan, but concerns about the spread of the coronavirus led him to change course to a race closer to home.
While a trip to Newport News is not quite the same as a trip to Japan, it yielded a first-place prize - a souvenir Welleck said he was not likely to have gotten from a trip to Lake Biwa.
Welleck's win Sunday was his first in a marathon. He crossed the finish line with a wide smile and arms over his head. He said he was thrilled to win the race and happy with the pace he maintained to finish in 2:22:46.
Jason Todd, president of marathon operator Flat Out Events, said in the weeks leading up to One City, they received multiple late registrations from people altering their plans to run in marathons overseas. The Tokyo Marathon was also held Sunday, but organizers there did not allow spectators to gather, and they reduced the field of runners from 38,000 down to just elite athletes because of concerns related to the coronavirus, according to The New York Times.
"You train for a race, you still want to run even if you can't go to the one you planned," Todd said.
This year's One City Marathon event had about 2,700 people register for the marathon, half-marathon, marathon relay, 8K and mile fun run. The fun run drew about 750 Newport News Public Schools students, according to the city.
Runners at the finish line in front of the Victory Arch were welcomed by hallmarks of the race over its six years: enthusiastic crowds to cheer them on, good views, a flat course and favorable weather. Thanks to the city's geography, the marathon route follows a simple north to south path that starts in Newport News Park and ends at downtown.
The marathon's first female finisher also came from New York.
Victoria Robitaille, a project manager from Long Island, ran a personal best 2:47:53. She came to Newport News on the recommendation of her coach, who ran the course before and said he liked it. The views along the way stood out to her. One City was her third marathon and first win. At the finish line, she met up with her brother, who ran in the half-marathon.
The half-marathon drew a variety of runners and experience levels.
Hannah Symonds ran in shorter One City races the last few years, but the half-marathon was a new challenge. Along with playing sports and training for the 13.1 miles, she got a little boost in the days before the race - someone in one of her classes at Peasley Middle School in Gloucester doubting she could do it.
Symonds and fellow Peasley students Grayson Howlett and Peyton Sutton each ran the half-marathon. The trio met at the finish line and garnered about as much applause as the race winners.
They said they run to be in better shape for their primary sports: baseball for Howlett and field hockey for Symonds and Sutton. They're also pretty competitive. Howlett said he stayed motivated by identifying runners ahead of him he wanted to pass. At the end, he still had plenty of gas and finished in a near sprint, passing a couple more people in the process.
Symonds felt more kids her age could do a half-marathon. The first hurdle is just deciding it's possible, she said.
Recovering near each other after the finish line were Dequon Smith of Suffolk and Angie Spencer of Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
This was Smith's first half-marathon after starting to train in December. Spencer said she hasn't run many half-marathons, but she's a seasoned distance runner. She's completed at least one marathon in each of the 50 states.
Spencer said she believes the first challenge when getting into distance running is the first three miles. "Once you can do that, there's a mental toughness to just keep going," said Spencer, who hosts a podcast about running marathons.
Smith, a sailor on the USS George H.W. Bush, said distance running never really occurred to him, but a friend pushed him to try. On his first long race, Smith said the crowd and environment helped get his adrenaline going to finish strong.
Along the final stretch to the finish line, runners who had finished joined the cheering crowds to encourage others still in the race. Grayson Owens was among that crowd, carrying a red sign encouraging his mom, Ashley. Matt Owens, Grayson's dad and Ashley's husband, said they were visiting from Ohio for Ashley Owens' first half-marathon. Matt Owens said he wouldn't be hopping in for her next race - he was glad to cheer with Grayson.
Runners donned shirts with messages like "I hate running" and "My sport is your sport's punishment." There were also multiple tributes to Katie Thyne, a Newport News police officer who was killed earlier this year while conducting a traffic stop.
Organizers of the race said there were no major issues that occurred during the event.

Super Tuesday is make-or-break time for candidates

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A third of the delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president are up for grabs as voters in 14 states cast ballots for their top choices on Super Tuesday, a make-or-break contest for all candidates still running.
All eyes will be on the performance of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Democratic socialist who is the frontrunner after winning 45 delegates in the first three contests, prompting cheers from his left-leaning supporters but raising fears among some moderates.
"What is at stake is whether the party will begin to believe that Sanders is inevitable, or whether they will believe that there's a real battle for the nomination," said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank.
"Will it clarify that there is only one viable Sanders alternative," he said, noting there are now five or six such candidates, "and will Super Tuesday play the kind of decisive role in getting us there?"
Top among those alternatives are former Vice President Joe Biden, who won big Saturday in South Carolina, his first primary victory,Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg in his first contests.
No one expects the primaries to determine the Democratic presidential nominee because delegates will be divided proportionally among candidates in each of the states. But those contests could diminish or even crush the chances of some of the contenders.
"Super Tuesday is about winning or losing," said Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic national committeeman from Long Island who calls the primaries an important reality check. "You get points on the board, or you don't."
Here are five things to watch for on Super Tuesday.
Will Sanders surge?
Sanders sits at or near the top in polls taken in the big four states - California, Texas, North Carolina and Virginia - as well as in several smaller states. He is expected to reap plenty of delegates. But Bennett, who opposes Sanders' candidacy, asks, "Is Sanders doing what he alleges that his candidacy does, which is increasing turnout among low propensity voters or ... new voters?" An academic paper and a New York Times analysis found Sanders hasn't done that so far this year. Yet entrance polls for the Nevada caucuses also show Sanders won two-thirds of the youth and half the Latino vote. That could portend a shift to Sanders in Texas and other states, said Mike Hersh of the Progressive Democrats of America, which supports Sanders. "Something to watch," he said, "is if Bernie's magic in Nevada is going to be translatable to other states."
Will Biden bounce back?
Biden underperformed in the first three contests, trailing Sanders and picking up just 15 delegates. But Hersh noted the affection many Democrats have for Biden and said, "It's too early for anybody to count Vice President Biden out." Biden got a needed boost with a win in South Carolina, which could forecast he'll win Tuesday in Alabama, North Carolina and other southern states. "The Democratic electorates are similar: they're heavily African American and they tend to vote like South Carolina," Bennett said. The black vote could also help him in Texas, where a University of Houston Hobby School of Public Policy poll found Biden and Sanders virtually tied. Renee Cross, the school's senior director, said that split resulted "primarily due to the African American vote going to Biden and the Latino vote going to Sanders."
Will Bloomberg bloom?
Bloomberg, the self-funding billionaire and former Republican, will face voters Tuesday for the first time in his bid to become the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. It will be a major test of whether his more than $400 million dollars of wall-to-wall advertising overcomes his rivals' attacks and his uneven performance in the recent debates. After Biden's lackluster start, Bloomberg jumped into the race to become the Sanders alternative. "Biden's reputation and his affection within the party will be tested by Bloomberg spending," Hersh said. Bloomberg's ubiquitous ads have helped him rise in the polls in Arkansas, Maine, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Virginia. "Bloomberg has a lot of money and he's hiring a lot of people," Hersh said. "But Bloomberg has very few volunteers. He has no donors. And people who donate to the campaign tend to be very much more ardent about that campaign."
Will Klobuchar and Warren win at home?
To win as a presidential candidate nationally, candidates are expected to win their home states. But Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota find themselves facing potential losses at home. Sanders, who leads led Warren by eight points in Massachusetts in Friday's WBUR poll, aims to deliver a knockout blow to his only rival in the left lane of the Democratic primaries by campaigning in Springfield and Boston Friday and Saturday. And to rob Klobuchar of the one primary she counted on winning for sure, Sanders will rev up his loyal base in St. Paul, Minnesota the night before Super Tuesday. A week ago, he trailed Klobuchar by 6 points in a local poll.
Will 'also rans' quit?
Will 'Also Rans' Quit?
A tough decision looms for the candidates that voters leave behind Tuesday: Should they keep campaigning or drop out? After disappointing finishes in South Carolina, wealthy climate activist Tom Steyer and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg already have suspended their campaigns. Klobuchar and Warren could be faced with a similar decision if they don't win enough delegates to be considered contenders and their fundraising stalls. But money won't be an issue for billionaire Bloomberg or Sanders, who has an expansive small-donor money machine. Still, some members of the Democratic establishment will pressure candidates who get little support Tuesday to step aside so an alternative to Sanders can emerge and the party can avoid a brokered convention. "After Super Tuesday, candidates have to really examine what role they can play in uniting the Democratic Party," Zimmerman said, "because our nation is facing the greatest threat to the Constitution since the Civil War."
A tough decision looms for the candidates who voters leave behind Tuesday: Should they keep campaigning or drop out? Most will want to stay in the race. Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend and the first openly gay presidential candidate who won the New Hampshire primary and came in second in Iowa, ended his quest Sunday.  Wealthy climate activist Tom Steyer dropped out after a disappointing finish in South Carolina despite spending nearly $200 million on his campaign. The usual reason to quit - a shortage of money - could be a question for Klobuchar and Warren should they fall flat on Tuesday. But money won't be an issue for Bloomberg. And Sanders has an expansive small-donor money machine. Still, some members of the Democratic establishment will pressure moderate candidates who get little support Tuesday to step aside so an alternative to Sanders can emerge and the party can avoid a brokered convention.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The federal government is "ramping up testing" in the United States for the coronavirus and is looking to vastly increase its screening efforts as global cases of the virus continue to rise, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Sunday.
Azar and Vice President Mike Pence made the rounds of the Sunday morning political talk shows looking to assure the public that risk to most Americans remains low despite the inevitability of more cases arising in the near future.
"I think it's very important that we treat the American people like adults and explain to them that we don't know where this will go, that we will see more cases, that we will see continued community spreading in the United States, as we're seeing around the world," Azar said during an appearance on ABC's "This Week." "How big that gets, we do not know. But we have the most advanced public health system and surveillance system in the world. We are actively working on a vaccine. We are actively working on therapeutics. The diagnostic is out in the field, and we're going to work to protect the American people with every tool that we've got."
Azar, responding to criticisms that the Trump administration did not move quickly enough to develop and provide testing kits to impacted communities, said the United States currently has the "ability to test 75,000 people in the field at this moment, and that will increase radically over the next couple of weeks."
The secretary said federal health agencies want to "expand that kind of surveillance [and] testing nationwide" and were awaiting on a bipartisan emergency spending package from Congress.
"As soon as Congress gets us the money, that will be out there throughout the country," Azar said of more testing efforts.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday said he hopes the spending plan is approved by next week and called for any plan that passes to include a provision that would make a possible coronavirus vaccine free for Medicare recipients.
"Seniors will need the vaccine the most, because they're the most susceptible, and they should not have to worry or wonder where they stand once the vaccine becomes available," Schumer said at a news conference in his Manhattan office.
No coronavirus vaccine currently exists. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health has said it could take a year to a year and a half for a successful vaccine to emerge.
Pence, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press" said "there's no question" there will be more cases of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, but said the risk "remains low" to Americans.
"We're going to bring the best scientific minds, experts together ... we're going to work every day ... to contain this disease, to treat those that are contracted, and I'm very confident we're ready, and I know ... that we'll get through this," said Pence who was tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the federal government's response to the disease.
Pence told "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd that the administration would "respect any decisions that are made at the state and local level" to address the virus. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Saturday announced that New York had received approval by federal health officials to begin its testing, the approval coming after the governor pressed Pence to fast track the decision.
"Those are decisions that governors in consultation with local health officials will make as they deem that necessary," Pence said when asked about the prospect of school closures. "But other than in areas where there are individuals that have been infected with the coronavirus, people need to understand that for the average American, the risk does remain low."
Pence said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were working with local officials in Washington State to determine how the first person in the United States to die from the disease - a man in his 50s - became infected. A man in his 70s, also in Washington state, was reported by local health officials to have died of the disease Sunday night.
The disease, which spread quickly from its epicenter in Wuhan, China, is now present in 84 U.S. cases, with more than 88,000 reported cases of infection worldwide. More than 3,000 people have died from the disease, according to the CDC.
Trump in a Sunday morning tweet said "in addition to screening travelers 'prior to boarding' from certain designated high risk countries," the United States will also screen those travelers when they arrive in the country.
The virus has become the latest issue at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race.
Both Pence and Azar faced questions about Trump's comments Saturday at a conservative political conference, where he accused Democrats of weaponizing the virus as a "new hoax" against his administration.
Asked on ABC's "This Week" if it was appropriate to use the term hoax in the context of the disease, Azar said that Trump was referring to "the political sniping that we're seeing."
Former Vice President Joe Biden, appearing on "This Week" before Azar, took aim at Trump's appointment of Pence to coordinate the virus response efforts, saying he saw "no preparedness" from Trump "other than political talking points, putting someone in charge who is not a scientist and muzzling the scientists."
"This is not a Democratic hoax, this is incompetence," said Biden who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Democratic presidential hopeful Mike Bloomberg, in an unprecedented move, purchased three minutes of prime-time airtime on NBC and CBS to deliver a prerecorded address on the coronavirus. The advertisement's background resembles the Oval Office, where presidents have long delivered their national addresses.
In the ad, Bloomberg touts his experience as mayor leading New York City's recovery in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"Each crisis is different, but they all require steady leadership, team building and preparation," states Bloomberg. "As Americans we have faced many challenges before, and we have overcome them together by looking out for one another - and I am confident that is how we will get through this one as well."
It's unclear how much Bloomberg, a self-made billionaire spent to air the ads, but The New York Times reported it could have cost anywhere from $1.25 million to $3 million.
Bloomberg, appearing on CBS' "60 Minutes" criticized Trump's response to the all the uncertainty surrounding the virus saying, "It is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say 'We don't know. But we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.' "

Why the Big Swarms of Young Sandernistas?

Texto completo: William Galston's explanation for "Why the Young Back Bernie Sanders" (Politics & Ideas, Feb. 19) can be summed up that their generation got a raw deal. Young adults today are much more willing than were prior generations at the same age to entertain the possibility of radical change, and support Sen. Sanders as a leader who will make that happen.
Mr. Galston misses the gross malfeasance on the part of educators who failed to provide a relevant frame of historical reference for what they now consider to be a grossly unjust and irresponsible nation. Were things that much better for young adults who graduated from college just before World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War?
Young adults today received a steady diet of social-justice, secular-progressive and climate-change dogma from grade school to graduate school. The New York Times 1619 Project that repackages American history as four centuries of white, male privilege and exploitation of all others is the latest example of an agenda-driven story peddled to a more diverse generation split between guilt-ridden whites and victims of white privilege.
If you are blessed to be born in a country that has outperformed the world for 400 years and still offers better prospects for a comfortable lifestyle than any other nation, and you think the country needs a radical makeover by Bernie Sanders, you were punked by the left-wing ideologues teaching your social-studies classes.

Young people have been told all of their politically aware lives that the economy is rigged, the American dream is dead, and "you didn't build that." The idea of success has been replaced with an image of inherent corruption and criminality attributed to all "millionaires and billionaires." They've been told that the world is biased and rife with bigotry, and that they're likely victims whose only hope is to rely on the government to take care of them.
Much of this has been politically expedient rhetoric for the politicians who spout such notions to win elections, but to the young and inexperienced, it appears to have stuck. Is it any surprise, with this onslaught of deliberate negative messaging, that the young support someone calling to overthrow the foundations of America?

Where is President John F. Kennedy who exhorted Americans: "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." Today many of the youngest voters in the Democratic Party who support the entitlement policies of Bernie Sanders have turned those words around: Ask what your country can do for you.

UTILITIES ARE PRICED FOR PERFECTION CORONAVIRUS FEAR HAS GIVEN THE SECTOR A TECH-LIKE VALUATION

Texto completo: Utilities are more Tennessee Valley than Silicon Valley, but they're having a distinctly tech-like moment. At more than 20 times forward earnings, they sport an average multiple on a par with tech stocks.
Have the poles-and-wires guys somehow morphed into digital growth machines? Not so much. Utility earnings are expected to rise by just more than 4% in each of the next two years, well below what's estimated for technology stocks (and the broader market). Same goes for trailing earnings growth.
What the utilities do have going for them right now is the thing afflicting most everyone else: fear of a pandemic.
Last Wednesday marked a watershed in the energy world, with utilities' weighting in the S&P 500 rising above that of the energy (or oil and gas) sector for the first time ever. Leave aside things like energy transition and climate change, and this dichotomy explains a lot. Oil and gas is a cyclical, global business where China looms disproportionately large, and the oil price is a go-to macro trade. A pandemic scare originating in the center of global demand growth is about as bad as it gets for oil - and it's also not great for a host of other sectors relying on global markets and supply chains, tech included.
Utilities are the opposite of this. They are overwhelmingly domestic, with wires strung above and pipes laid below American streets. Demand for their products isn't likely to be affected too much whether people are commuting or staying home. More importantly, demand doesn't drive their near-term earnings anyway; regulators set an allowed return on investment. This is why energy stocks now yield almost 5% and utilities less than 3%. The majors are being penalized for spending money, while utilities are rewarded for doing just that.
It isn't the promise of high growth pushing utilities higher; it's more the sense their earnings will be resilient to whatever is coming on the coronavirus front. For example, we are yet to see what happens when a major outbreak is confirmed within the U.S.
Pandemic-flavored panic also offers a boost via the bond market.
The premium has obviously kicked up this year, but it has been there since late 2018. That was when the market sold off heavily on concerns about excessive tightening by the Federal Reserve. Then 2019 saw the interplay of fears about a trade war and the Fed's pivot, first toward holding off on further interest-rate hikes and then to outright easing. Like the coronavirus, this backdrop of turmoil centered on international business activity played to utilities' strengths.
The added twist is that utilities' regulated earnings and high payouts have long led investors to treat them as bond proxies. Greg Gordon, an analyst at Evercore ISI, tracks the relationship between utility dividend yields and the yield on a Moody's Corp. index of triple-B-rated corporate debt. As corporate bond yields feel the gravitational pull of a sinking 10-year Treasury yield - cut in half since the start of 2019 to today's 1.34% - so utility yields have also reset lower and lower:
This presents a conundrum. On one hand, utility valuations clearly look stretched. Their premium to the S&P 500 looks historically high, and they also trade significantly above another defensive sector, health care.
And yet the spread between utility dividend yields and corporate bond yields has narrowed to less than 60 basis points, roughly half the average of the past decade. That leaves little room for utility yields to rise without breaching the long-established relationship with the bond index. The latter, meanwhile, is being held down by those record low Treasury yields; and what with pandemic fears and an oncoming election, it is hard to see right now what could shift those appreciably.
One risk is that the fear that has crept into high-yield bonds seeps up into the higher-rated end of the market. That would loosen the grip of investment grade yields (hardly bargains themselves) on Treasuries, meaning wider spreads - and ultimately higher dividend yields and lower prices for utility stocks.
It would be correct to say utilities are priced for something like perfection. In the current context, though, "perfection" means something pretty awful.

AJC TOP LOCAL STORY CORONAVIRUS: Trump to visit Friday to convene with CDC: Vice President, official assure that overall risk to Americans is low.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is set to visit the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday as he tries to calm growing fears about the coronavirus outbreak.
The trip was detailed a day after health officials confirmed the first death in the U.S. from the coronavirus, leading the president to issue new restrictions on foreign travel and warn that additional cases of the illness are "likely."
Officials with direct knowledge of the planning outlined the details of Trump's trip to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday. It will be the president's eighth visit to Georgia and his first to the sprawling CDC complex.
The president, who has faced criticism that he has trivialized the extent of the threat, said he will also discuss a potential vaccine for the virus this week with health officials.
Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump has tasked with leading the coronavirus response, also announced the State Department would issue a "Do not travel" alert for parts of Italy and South Korea affected by the virus.
Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar sought to reassure the American public that the federal government is working to make sure state and local authorities are able to test for the virus. Both said during a round of TV talk show appearances Sunday that thousands more testing kits had been distributed to state and local officials, with thousands more to come.
"They should know we have the best public health system in the world looking out for them," Azar said, adding that additional cases will be reported and the overall risk to Americans is low.
Trump said he would be meeting today with pharmaceutical executives to discuss how a vaccine could be developed "very quickly," and that the United States had adequate supplies to confront a spread of the illness, including 43 million surgical masks, with more on the way.
"Our country is prepared for any circumstance," the president added. "We hope it's not going to be a major circumstance, it'll be a smaller circumstance. But whatever the circumstances, we're prepared."
Georgia health officials are bracing for the possibility of local cases of the virus, which has infected nearly 87,000 people across the globe.
There were 70 confirmed cases in the U.S. on Saturday, including one patient in Washington state who died of the illness, but none reported in Georgia. Officials from the CDC warn it's just a matter of time before the country sees more diagnoses.
Gov. Brian Kemp on Friday named a task force made up of several of his administration's top deputies, along with health and school officials, to identify the best ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia.

Texto completo: Father Cardenal defied the Roman Catholic Church in the 1980s by serving as a minister in the revolutionary government of Nicaragua.
The Rev. Ernesto Cardenal, one of Latin America's most admired poets and priests, who defied the Roman Catholic Church in the 1980s by serving in the revolutionary Sandinista government of Nicaragua, died on Sunday in Managua, Nicaragua. He was 95.
His personal assistant, Luz Marina Acosta, confirmed his death to The Associated Press.
Born to a wealthy Nicaraguan family, Father Cardenal became a prominent intellectual voice of the Nicaraguan revolution and an ardent proponent of liberation theology, a Christian movement rooted in Marxist principles and committed to social justice and uplifting the poor. He was appointed Nicaragua's first minister of culture after the Sandinistas overthrew the dictator Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979.
As the Vatican's opposition to liberation theology intensified in the 1980s under Pope John Paul II, Father Cardenal became a focal point. Before a scheduled visit to Nicaragua in 1983, the pope publicly demanded that Father Cardenal and four other priests who had actively supported the revolution resign their government positions. The Sandinista government refused the demand to replace them, but said its invitation to the pope still stood.
After months of public arguing, the pope accepted the invitation and landed in Managua, Nicaragua's capital. As he walked along a receiving line on the tarmac shaking hands, the pope seemed taken aback to see Father Cardenal among the dignitaries.
While other priests were in clerical garb, Father Cardenal had shown up wearing a collarless white shirt, slacks and his signature black beret over his thick white hair. When he knelt to kiss the pope's ring, the pope withheld his hand and wagged his finger at him as he spoke to him, apparently sternly. According to a Vatican official, the pope told Father Cardenal, "You must straighten out your position with the church," The Associated Press reported.
Videotape of the scolding, though not audible, was broadcast around the world.
"Christ led me to Marx," Father Cardenal said in an interview in 1984. "I don't think the pope understands Marxism. For me, the four gospels are all equally communist. I'm a Marxist who believes in God, follows Christ, and is a revolutionary for the sake of his kingdom."
His priestly authority was revoked by Nicaragua's bishops that same year. (Three other priests were also disciplined.) Father Cardenal's suspension was lifted in February 2019, when Pope Francis granted him absolution from "all canonical censorships," the Vatican News reported.
Father Cardenal began writing poetry as a young man, tracing the tormented history of Nicaragua and Latin America as epics in blank verse.
Much of his poetry, though, was intimate: love poems that recalled the longings of his youth, finely wrought images of city lights at dusk or his famous "Prayer for Marilyn Monroe," in which he describes how Monroe was found on her deathbed in 1962, "like someone wounded by gangsters/stretching out his hand to a disconnected telephone."
Fascinated by evolution and its lessons for politics, Father Cardenal began to incorporate science into his poetry in the 1980s. He developed the theme until the end of his life, marveling at the origins of the universe and the mysteries of DNA -- sources of awe that in his vision brought people closer to God.
"In this monumental vision, everything merges and condenses," the Nicaraguan writer Sergio Ramírez wrote in the introduction to Father Cardenal's anthology "Ninety at Ninety," which was published in Spanish in 2014. "Not only do the poet's intimate personal experience and the scientific exploration of the heavens enter into the mystical, so do the memories of his own past."
The most recent complete collection of Father Cardenal's poetry published in English was "Pluriverse: New and Selected Poems," (2009, edited and translated in part by Jonathan Cohen).
Closing the volume was the poem "Stardust," Father Cardenal's meditation on death. It concludes:
And the galaxy was taking the shape of a flower
the way it looks now on a starry night.
Our flesh and our bones come from other stars
and perhaps even from other galaxies,
we are universal,
and after death we will help to form other stars
and other galaxies.
We come from the stars, and to them we shall return.
Ernesto Cardenal Martínez was born on Jan. 20, 1925, to an upper-class family in Granada, a city on Lake Nicaragua. He studied literature in Managua and at Columbia University in New York City, where he read Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson and Ezra Pound.
He returned to Nicaragua in the 1950s, but after a failed coup against the Somoza family, he fled and joined the Trappist monastery Gethsemani, in Kentucky, where he befriended the American monk and writer Thomas Merton. He was ordained a priest after his subsequent return to Nicaragua.
Father Cardenal was an early supporter of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which was founded in the early 1960s, named after Augusto César Sandino, the revolutionary who had led a guerrilla campaign against the American occupation of Nicaragua in the 1920s and '30s and was assassinated in 1934.
Father Cardenal furthered the cause after settling on an island in the Solentiname archipelago, in vast Lake Nicaragua near the southern border, in the 1960s. He built a chapel, founded an artists colony, and taught literature and painting to local residents.
His poetry began to gain recognition. He became known for what he called his "Epigrams" -- lyrical bursts about love and longing mixed with political and social commentary against the Somoza regime. In one, he wrote:
I've handed out clandestine pamphlets,
yelling: VIVA LA LIBERTAD! In the middle of the street
defying armed guards.
I participated in the April rebellion:
but I grow pale when I pass by your house
and one look from you makes me tremble.
His sermons, too, were political, full of denunciations of the Somoza regime. Some of his young parishioners became "guerrilleros," and the island became a central military training ground for the Sandinista movement. After the Sandinistas came to power in 1979, after a bloody period of rioting, guerrilla resistance and a mass kidnapping operation in the capital, Father Cardenal was named minister of culture by the junta leader, Daniel Ortega.
As a government minister, Father Cardenal sought what he called the "democratization of culture." He created poetry workshops around the country, tapping into Nicaragua's rich poetic tradition, embodied in part by Ruben Dario, who spearheaded a Latin American modernist literary movement in the late 19th century.
But Father Cardenal's critics said the ministry was imposing ideological uniformity by pressuring new writers to produce propaganda, particularly during the Sandinistas' long guerrilla war against an American-backed counterrevolutionary force, known as the contras.
No immediate family members survive. His brother, the Rev. Fernando Cardenal, died in 2016.
Father Cardenal remained culture minister until 1987, when the ministry was dissolved and merged with another government agency. In the 1990s he distanced himself from the Sandinista government and in recent years criticized what he called the increasingly authoritarian style of Mr. Ortega, who became president in 2007. For Father Cardenal, the Sandinista revolution had failed.
But he remained committed to his Marxist ideals.
"I am a revolutionary," Father Cardenal said in an interview with The New York Times published in January 2015. "Revolutionary means that I want to change the world."
He added: "The Bible is full of revolutions. The prophets are people with a message of revolution. Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come."

Texto completo: The president's response to rising fears over coronavirus has given his would-be opponents a chance to attack his biggest strength with voters: economic stewardship.
WASHINGTON -- Democratic presidential candidates have seized on President Trump's response to the spreading global coronavirus outbreak, and the growing threat it poses to America's record-long economic expansion, to attack the president on what has been his greatest strength with voters: the economy.
Until last week, the candidates had largely attacked Mr. Trump's economic management on inequality grounds, at a time when growth has been steady and unemployment has sunk to a half-century low. But they have begun to attack his stewardship more directly after fears over the effects of the virus dealt stock markets their worst week since 2008 and forced Federal Reserve officials to reassure investors that they were considering interest rate cuts to combat a potential growth slowdown.
Two candidates in desperate need of delegates on Super Tuesday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, revamped their stump speeches in recent days to aggressively attack Mr. Trump's handling of the issue and portray themselves as the type of president the United States needs to endure a potential economic and public health crisis.
Mr. Trump has played down the virus, insisting several times last week that it might not spread any further in the United States, and the economic threats from it. And he has lashed out at Democrats, saying they were the ones spooking investors.
"Stock Market starting to look very good to me!" he tweeted on Monday, before four more days of losses. As markets continued to slide, he and members of his administration encouraged Americans to buy stock. "The market will all come back," Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. "The markets are very strong. The consumer is unbelievably strong."
Mr. Bloomberg told a Democratic Party dinner in Charlotte, N.C., on Saturday night that "the White House is endangering lives and hurting our economy" in its response to the virus. He has reserved three minutes of paid network airtime on Sunday evening to address the nation on the subject.
"We all know the stock market has plunged out of fear," Mr. Bloomberg said in Charlotte, "but also because investors have no confidence that this president is capable of managing the crisis."
Ms. Warren, who warned last summer that the economy could be tipped into recession by an outside shock, also called the virus an economic crisis in a speech Saturday night in Houston. She called for targeted stimulus measures, including direct support from Congress to businesses that have seen supply chains disrupted by quarantines and factory shutdowns in Asia, and low-interest loans from the Fed "to companies that agree to support their workers and that need a little help to make it through the next few months."
"The impact on our families, particularly on babies and elderly people and people with other health challenges, could be severe" from the spread of the virus, she said. "And the impact on our economy could also be brutal, putting jobs at risk, threatening savings, undermining economic stability and even potentially destabilizing our giant, globally interconnected banks."
The front-runners in the race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the South Carolina primary Saturday, have also criticized Mr. Trump's management of the virus response. They have focused less than Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg on the economic effects and have emphasized public health issues.
Asked on Friday in a CNN interview how bad he thought the economic woes from the virus could get, Mr. Biden replied, "Well, I'm less concerned about the immediate economic impact than I am about whether or not we gain control of this." He went on to criticize the Trump administration's response. "The concern is: Do they have any idea what they're doing?"
None of the candidates have changed their core economic platforms, which to varying degrees all call for trillions of dollars in new taxes on the wealthy and on businesses to fund programs meant to help the middle class and the poor. And they have often cited threats from the virus as new evidence to support the need for their plans, such as universal health care.
Mr. Sanders said in a tweet last week that the outbreak showed that "it has never been more important to finally guarantee health care as a human right by passing Medicare for All."
Mr. Trump has called for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, though some economists caution that such a move may have a limited effect. And he has hinted at middle-class tax cuts, though tax experts who have spoken with the administration see the effort as more of a campaign centerpiece than an immediate stimulus package.
Democratic strategists say the virus -- and its potential economic effects -- have given candidates a new opportunity to criticize Mr. Trump's management abilities.
"Candidates are right to be critical when the president and his economic team are whistling past the graveyard and putting out happy talk about the economy when it's clear that a significant disruption is happening globally," said Ben LaBolt, a partner at Bully Pulpit Interactive who was the press secretary for President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. "There's no doubt it could be a defining issue of the campaign."
Economic forecasters say the spread of the virus in China -- and the supply chain disruptions it has already caused -- will at least temporarily slow growth around the world, including in the United States, this year.
Some economists expect the U.S. and global economies to rebound in the second half of the year, with minimal lasting damage: Goldman Sachs and Bank of America researchers have marked down their forecasts for U.S. growth this year by 0.1 percent because of virus effects.
Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned in a research note last week that "the risks are clearly skewed to the downside until the outbreak is contained."
Morgan Stanley researchers said on Friday that in a worst-case scenario, where the virus spreads more widely across countries and sectors of the economy, growth could slow to a near halt in the United States for much of this year, resulting in a 0.5 percent growth rate overall in 2020, which would be the worst since the financial crisis. The unemployment rate would climb back above 5 percent in that projection.
Such a slowdown could hamstring Mr. Trump's re-election prospects. Voters give him significantly higher marks on economic management than his overall performance as president.
That strength, and a relative lack of interest in economic issues among Democratic voters, has complicated candidates' efforts to criticize Mr. Trump on his signature issue.
Some pockets of the Democratic electorate, particularly black voters, rate the economy as their top concern, according to a new nationwide poll conducted for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey. But Democratic voters overall rate health care and the environment as more important issues. They are about half as likely as independent voters to call the economy a top issue.
Over the course of the campaign, Democratic candidates have generally sought to emphasize that the strong economy was not being felt by ordinary Americans, who they insisted were struggling to make ends meet. Several candidates blame Mr. Trump's trade war with China for hurting American workers. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have called for broad transformations of the economy, with far steeper taxes on wealthy people and corporations. The leading Democratic candidates are all eager to raise taxes on the rich, though they disagree about how far to go with increases.
Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren levied more direct attacks this weekend, while championing their own qualifications to steer the country through economic tumult. Mr. Bloomberg said he had dealt with public health and economic crises as a mayor, as a philanthropist and as the leader of his business, Bloomberg L.P., "so I understand the economic damage that bad policies can cause."
Ms. Warren said on Saturday night that the crisis demanded a more skilled leader than Mr. Trump or several of her Democratic rivals, taking shots at Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg. The moment required "someone whose core values can be trusted, who has a plan for how to govern and who can actually get it done," she said.
Mr. Trump, in turn, has blamed his Democratic rivals for unnerving investors. "I think they're not very happy with the Democrat candidates, when they see them," he told reporters on Friday. "I think that has an impact."

Ex-Lawmaker's Memoir To Adopt a Defiant Tone

Texto completo: Last fall, private photos were published of Ms. Hill, and the House investigated claims of a relationship with an aide. Her farewell speech became famous.
Last fall, Katie Hill, a Democratic congresswoman from California, faced some of the darkest moments of her life. Nude photos of her had been published online without her consent, and the House was investigating her over an alleged sexual relationship with one of her staff members, which she denied.
She resigned from Congress, but during a farewell speech on the House floor, she delivered a passionate indictment of revenge porn and what she called a "double standard" when it comes to women's sexual behavior. "I'm stepping down, but I refuse to let this experience scare off other women who dare to take risks, who dare to step into this light, who dare to be powerful," she said in the speech, which later went viral.
Hill will expand on that message in "She Will Rise," a book that is part memoir, part gender-equity battle plan, which Grand Central Publishing plans to publish on Aug. 18. The date is the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.
The former congresswoman is exactly the kind of client that Anna Sproul-Latimer, the literary agent who represents Hill, had hoped to attract when she started Neon Literary with her co-founder, Kent Wolf, this past December. "My clients all share a sense that they really want to change the story of the world in some way," Sproul-Latimer said.
After years as an agent at Ross Yoon Agency in Washington, she was inspired to start her own firm after reading about the connections that Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender who died in August, had to the publishing world and prominent nonfiction writers.
Though the publishing industry struggles with low salaries and razor-thin margins, it wields significant power over the public discourse. Sproul-Latimer said she hopes to shift that power to writers whose voices are seldom heard.
The agency represents writers such as Carmen Maria Machado, who has written genre-bending short stories and memoir, and Ingrid Rojas Contreras, a novelist whose debut centered on a domestic worker in Colombia. Neon also represents Zoë Quinn, a video game developer, and Samantha Irby, a humor writer.
"I'm excited about the other people that she's signing," Hill said of Sproul-Latimer and Wolf's budding list of clients, several of whom have also spoken out about sexual harassment or gender discrimination. "I hope we can create a network out of that."
What Hill wants women to take away from her book is that they can own their mistakes and get back up, no matter how difficult their experience. "It would be much easier for me to just disappear, but I'm not, and this is an act of defiance, staying in the forefront," she said. "You can't let other people take away your power or your voice, even when it's hard."

Texto completo: The rule is intended to weed out candidates who don't have a viable path to the nomination.
If you pay attention to the news ahead of Super Tuesday, you're likely to hear about a critical bar that the candidates face, a baseline test that could reshape the large field of Democrats seeking the party's nomination.
It's called the 15 percent rule, and here's how it works.
What's at stake?
Well, the nomination, of course. To get there, candidates must capture a majority of the 3,979 pledged delegates -- 1,991, to be precise -- at the convention this summer in Milwaukee.
During the primaries, the candidates are competing for two major pools of delegates.
One pool, known as at-large delegates, are allocated statewide; another, known as district-level delegates, are awarded by congressional district. In each case, a candidate must win at least 15 percent of the vote to be eligible for those delegates.
Candidates who fall short of the threshold statewide could still win district-level delegates if they capture more than 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district. But in a relatively large field, not everyone will be able to clear that bar in each state or congressional district, and those who don't will be shut out.
The results could be significant in states like California, Super Tuesday's biggest prize. It has 415 pledged delegates -- 271 apportioned based on the results in the state's 53 congressional districts and 144 awarded by statewide vote.
How are delegates awarded?
Delegates are distributed proportionally among the candidates who clear the 15 percent cutoff. With as many as six candidates competing on Tuesday, several could pick up delegates, prolonging the race and making it harder for the front-runner to clinch the nomination.
"It's very hard for winners to wrap up delegates," said Elaine C. Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of "Primary Politics: Everything You Need to Know About How America Nominates Its Presidential Candidates."
"The system tends to reward not losers, but second-place finishers, and that keeps the race going longer," said Ms. Kamarck, who, as a member of the Democratic National Committee, could play a role in the process, as a superdelegate.
Already, some are concerned that the race could lead to a brokered convention for the first time since 1952, if no candidate hits the magic number of 1,991.
What happens to candidates who don't clear the 15 percent threshold?
Candidates who fail to clear that bar in a particular state or district cannot win delegates there -- and are locked out of the most critical part of the nominating contest.
Some could find their paths to the nomination all but blocked, as the cold reality of delegate math overtakes the bluster and spin used to paper over poor showings in early states. As these lower-tier candidates fall further behind in the hunt for delegates, donations could dry up and volunteers may quit.
The 15 percent rule, which was adopted in 1988, was designed to weed out candidates who don't have a viable path to the nomination, Ms. Kamarck said.
"You have to shrink this somehow, right? And that's what this was designed to do: Take out the smaller candidates," she said.
What if just a few candidates clear the 15 percent bar?
The more candidates who fail to clear the threshold, the better it is for those who do. That's because the votes of the failed candidates are effectively discarded when the delegate count is calculated. The math can significantly bump up the haul for the leading candidates.
For example, if only one candidate were to clear the bar in a given state or congressional district, even if he or she earned just 16 percent of the vote, that candidate would take home all the delegates in that area. If two or more clear the bar, they split the delegates proportionally, with the votes of the failed candidates excluded.
This could play out in powerful ways on Tuesday, when more than 1,300 delegates will be awarded -- about a third of the total at stake in the entire nominating contest.
For example, a poll released on Friday by the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont capturing 34 percent of likely voters in California's Democratic primary.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the only other candidate to clear the 15 percent threshold, with 17 percent support in the poll. If that were the result on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders might only have to yield a relatively small portion of California's at-large delegates to Ms. Warren.
"This situation gives Sanders an excellent chance of capturing the lion's share of the state's 415 pledged delegates," the institute said.

Texto completo: At a rehearsal one recent afternoon, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra was roaring out the final scene of Wagner's "Der Fliegende Holländer" ("The Flying Dutchman"), which opens on Monday, the first new Met production of the work in over 30 years.
A man's shadow, projected onto a screen at the back of the stage, stood several stories high behind the action. Watching it, it was hard not to think of another giant looming over this production, even in absentia: the commanding Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel, who had been scheduled to return to the Met for the first time in eight years to sing the title role in Wagner's early, torrid Romantic masterpiece.
Then, late in January, while appearing as the Dutchman in Spain, Mr. Terfel fell and fractured his ankle.
"Unfortunately I've been around long enough that I'm used to calls like that," Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, recalled with a rueful chuckle.
Mr. Terfel must have some variant of the Dutchman's curse, which in the opera has condemned the character to roam the oceans forever, allowed to leave his ship only once every seven years to try and break the spell.
"He was supposed to sing in the new production of 'Tosca' a couple of years ago," Mr. Gelb said. "Then he arrived to rehearse and couldn't perform. So he felt terrible that, once again, something beyond his control kept him from being here."
The Met eventually found, in Evgeny Nikitin, an experienced replacement. He extricated himself from some engagements in Russia with the help of Valery Gergiev, who is conducting the new production and wields considerable clout in their homeland.
Mr. Nikitin joins the soprano Anja Kampe, who plays Senta, a young woman who has grown obsessed with the Dutchman legend, practically worshiping a portrait of him that hangs in her father's house. She fantasizes about breaking the curse, and -- spoiler alert -- eventually sacrifices herself to save his soul. (A man's redemption through the love of a faithful woman is a favorite Wagnerian theme.)
Ms. Kampe has had a sterling career in Europe for two decades, but is only now making her Met debut. The company had offered her roles in the past, she said in an interview after running the score with Mr. Gergiev in a basement rehearsal studio, "but I wanted to wait for the right thing."
If this "Dutchman" -- a co-production with Dutch National Opera, the Abu Dhabi Festival and Opéra de Québec, which premiered it last summer -- isn't the right thing, it's hard to know what would be. The director, François Girard, has directed only a single opera at the Met, a vivid, sensitive version of Wagner's "Parsifal" that was introduced here in 2013 and revived in 2018, but was one of the most acclaimed stagings of Mr. Gelb's 14-year tenure.
"'Parsifal' is set in a world of unreality and we tried to pull it back to reality," Mr. Girard said, sitting in the theater after rehearsal. "Except for the Dutchman and his ghosts, this is the opposite. We've removed it from the ground zero of reality. Which helps the piece. When you play it too realistically, you expose its simplicity or naïveté."
In other words, the more stylized the action -- the more it seems to take place inside Senta's fevered imagination -- the more muted its antiquated gender dynamics. For Mr. Girard, the most challengingly misogynistic aspect of the piece is that Daland, Senta's father, agrees to trade his daughter for some gold the Dutchman is carrying, a troublingly mercenary transaction. In the new production, though, the Dutchman and his sailors have wandered the cosmos, arriving not with gold but with glowing rocks that, for Mr. Girard, represent "cosmic power, cosmic knowledge."
"We elevated the currency, therefore elevating the trade," he added. "And then that rock -- by the end, everyone has one; everyone has been contaminated by the cosmic light."
The set completes the Met's iconic golden proscenium with a matching lower lip, giving the staging the impression of taking place within Senta's painting, or perhaps even within her mind. That recurring, looming shadow of a man is actually created in real time by a dancer backstage wearing a motion-capture suit, a way of representing the Dutchman's supernatural nature without falling into what Mr. Girard called "the skeleton clichés." (Think the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies.)
Mr. Girard began his career as a film director ("Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould," "The Red Violin"), but when he began to work in live performance, he was at first reluctant to incorporate film into his stagings. He's gradually shrugged off that reticence, and the "Dutchman" overture introduces a heady mixture of painted elements, video and dance that continues throughout the intermissionless performance: "It's like in a dream," Ms. Kampe said.
Questions remain, and not just about how Mr. Nikitin will live up to the expectations of many in the audience who were eagerly anticipating Mr. Terfel. While Mr. Gergiev has done much Wagner, at the Met and elsewhere, his performances are notoriously uneven: sometimes inspired, sometimes phoned-in.
Last summer, when he conducted Wagner's "Tannhäuser" for his debut at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, reviews reflected this. Joshua Barone wrote in The New York Times that "his interpretation of the music was unreliably thoughtful, and at times lackadaisical." (The festival announced another conductor for this year's revival.)
And the Met's lead singers are worried -- as, to be fair, singers often are -- about being heard, given that the staging tends to place them high and upstage. "It's a pity we are so behind, for the sound," said Ms. Kampe, who has the charming habit of repeating words in triplicate when she wants to make a point. "It's high up, and back, back, back. It's all open. In the back we have some fabric and no wood; it goes up, up, up."
About Mr. Girard's sensible symbolism and visual flair, however, no one takes serious issue. With the hit "Parsifal" under his belt and now a second Wagner opera, with a third to come -- "Lohengrin," currently in development for a future Met season -- he is swiftly becoming the company's go-to director for this challenging but rewarding composer. Not that that was the plan.
"It wasn't a project," he said, and quoted himself from a recent roundtable discussion: "I feel I didn't choose Wagner; Wagner chose me."
"With 'Tosca,"' he added, "I really like watching it. But if I read the text, I think: Give me a camera, I'll make a movie. But Wagner is a theatrical space I feel comfortable in."

Texto completo: Floyd Abrams, the constitutional lawyer, discusses disclosure obligations of large donors.
To the Editor:
Re "More Money, More Political Problems" (editorial, Feb. 2):
You offer a welcome response to a significant body of opinion from influential right- and sometimes left-leaning civil liberties organizations that have opposed more disclosure obligations of the identity of large donors to political nonprofits on First Amendment grounds.
You argue that "disclosure is crucial," and you are not only correct but also in accord with recent Supreme Court rulings.
In case after case, the Supreme Court has rejected objections to such disclosures, relying in one ruling on the "First Amendment interests of individual citizens seeking to make informed choices in the political marketplace"; in another, on the critical interest of enabling the electorate "to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages"; and in a third, on disclosure offering "a particularly effective means of arming the voting public with information."
To be sure, there are situations in which required public disclosure can lead to dangers to those who contribute to organizations that take unpopular political or social positions and that could thus be subjected to what the Supreme Court has referred to as "economic reprisals or physical threats."
Exemptions to disclosure requirements can and should be granted in those cases. But the First Amendment is better served by more disclosure as to who is speaking rather than by less.
Floyd Abrams

Why the Success of The Times May Be Bad News for Journalism

Texto completo: In his debut, our new media columnist says The Times has become like Facebook or Google -- a digital behemoth crowding out the competition.
The first time I met A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times, I tried to hire him.
That was back in the heady days of digital media in 2014, and I was at BuzzFeed News, one of a handful of start-ups preparing to sweep aside dying legacy outlets like The Times.
Times stock was still sputtering, and the company had sold off everything but its furniture to keep paying for journalism.
Mr. Sulzberger, then the heir apparent to lead The Times, politely declined my offer. And today, after eight years as BuzzFeed editor in chief, I find myself in his employ as the new media columnist.
I'm stepping into the space opened a decade ago by David Carr, the late columnist who chronicled an explosion of new online outlets. My focus will probably be the opposite: The consolidation of everything from movies to news, as the media industry gets hollowed out by the same rich-get-richer, winner-take-all forces that have reshaped businesses from airlines to pharmaceuticals.
And the story of consolidation in media is a story about The Times itself.
The gulf between The Times and the rest of the industry is vast and keeps growing: The company now has more digital subscribers than The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and the 250 local Gannett papers combined, according to the most recent data. And The Times employs 1,700 journalists -- a huge number in an industry where total employment nationally has fallen to somewhere between 20,000 and 38,000.
The Times so dominates the news business that it has absorbed many of the people who once threatened it: The former top editors of Gawker, Recode, and Quartz are all at The Times, as are many of the reporters who first made Politico a must-read in Washington.
I spent my whole career competing against The Times, so coming to work here feels a bit like giving in. And I worry that the success of The Times is crowding out the competition.
"The New York Times is going to basically be a monopoly," predicted Jim VandeHei, the founder of Axios, which started in 2016 with plans to sell digital subscriptions but has yet to do so. "The Times will get bigger and the niche will get nichier, and nothing else will survive."
Janice Min, the former Us Weekly editor who reinvented The Hollywood Reporter, said The Times's broadening content mix posed a formidable obstacle for other digital subscription businesses.
"Because we're talking about the publishing business, it's all still kind of sad, but in this parallel universe people talk about The New York Times in the way people in Hollywood talk about Netflix," Ms. Min said. "It's the tail that wags the dog, and it's also the dog."
The rise of The Times from wounded giant to reigning colossus has been as breathtaking as that of any start-up. As recently as 2014, print advertising was collapsing and the idea that subscribers would pay enough to support the company's expensive global news gathering seemed like a pipe dream.
"We sold off every bit of the company we could sell off to hold our journalism investment as flat as humanly possible," Mr. Sulzberger, who became publisher in 2018, told me in an interview last week. "All the smart people in media thought it was crazy, all our shareholders thought it was financially irresponsible."
Just a few years later, amid a deepening crisis in American journalism, and a sustained attack from the president of the United States, Times stock has rebounded to nearly triple what it was in 2014 and the newsroom has added 400 employees. The starting salary for most reporters is $ 104,600.
The paper is now quietly shopping for dominance in an adjacent industry: audio. The Times is in exclusive talks to acquire Serial Productions, the breakthrough podcast studio that has attracted more than 300 million downloads.
The purchase requires deep pockets: Serial was for sale at a valuation of about $ 75 million, according to two people who were briefed on the deal, though The Times is expected to pay significantly less. (The Wall Street Journal first reported last month that Serial was for sale.)
The deal, along with The Daily, the popular weekday podcast at The Times, could form the basis for an ambitious new paid product -- like the company's Cooking and Crossword apps -- that executives believe could become the HBO of podcasts.
When I spoke to Mr. Sulzberger last week, I was reminded of other figures in this digital economy who have experienced success at dizzying scale and speed, and still cannot believe it when you mention the word "monopoly."
He sees plenty of competition for The Times -- he cited cable news, though its own future is uncertain. What's more, he says, Americans will buy more than one news subscription. He believes The Times is not dominating the market so much as creating one.
"What I actually think you're seeing is not a winner-take-all dynamic -- what you're actually seeing is a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats dynamism," said Mr. Sulzberger (who no doubt would have flourished in that midlevel product job I offered him).
His optimism is shared, at least publicly, by the small handful of news organizations that are scraping by on local subscriptions.
"The Times has shown the rest of the industry a path to some success," said Brian McGrory, editor of The Boston Globe, which has attracted more than 100,000 digital subscribers.
Times executives say they are also looking for a way to help out their weaker cousins, given the threat that the collapse of local journalism poses to democracy.
"But as they say in the airplanes, put your own oxygen mask on first before you start to help others," said Mark Thompson, the newspaper's chief executive.
Because The Times now overshadows so much of the industry, the cultural and ideological battles that used to break out between news organizations -- like whether to say that President Trump lied -- now play out inside The Times.
And The Times has swallowed so much of what was once called new media that the paper can read as an uneasy competition of dueling traditions: The Style section is a more polished Gawker, while the opinion pages reflect the best and worst of The Atlantic's provocations. The magazine publishes bold arguments about race and American history, and the campaign coverage channels Politico's scoopy aggression.
I'm proud to be leaving BuzzFeed News as one of a handful of strong, independent newsrooms still standing amid the rubble of consolidation. But I miss the wide open moment 10 years ago, when we were among a wave of new players reimagining what news meant.
My job as columnist here will be an exciting and uncomfortable one -- covering this new media age from inside one of its titans (though I hope you'll tell me if I ever get too far inside).
And I hope that earlier era of innovation didn't exist merely to create a farm team and some lessons for the newspaper equivalent of the 1927 Yankees.
"The moat is so wide now that I can't see anyone getting into it," Josh Tyrangiel, former senior vice president of news at Vice who is now producing television and documentaries, said in an interview. "There's no new thing coming. And the editor of BuzzFeed News, who was probably the chief insurgent, is now writing this column for you at The New York Times."

Texto completo: A woman in her 30s who had traveled in Iran contracted the virus and is now isolated at home.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday confirmed New York State's first case of the coronavirus, saying that a woman contracted the virus while traveling in Iran and is now in New York City isolated in her home.
"The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York," Governor Cuomo said in a statement.
The woman, who is in her late 30s, is in Manhattan, according to state officials. She returned from Iran last week, and was tested after going to a hospital in the city; she has since been staying at home, officials said.
The sample submitted for testing was analyzed on Sunday in the Wadsworth Lab in Albany, N.Y. Those results will now be reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
New York City's Health Commissioner, Oxiris Barbot, said the agency had already identified "close contacts of the patient" who may have been exposed to the virus, officially known as Covid-19.
"Our disease detectives have already identified close contacts of the patient, who may have been exposed, and will take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19," Dr. Barbot said. "Despite this development, New Yorkers remain at low risk for contracting Covid-19."
Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Cuomo, both Democrats, said they would brief the public on Monday morning.
Still the news that the coronavirus had landed in Manhattan was sure to raise the level of anxiety across this dense city, where people spend their days in close quarters. For weeks, the city has been bracing for the virus's arrival, as it spread across much of the world.
By this weekend, many stores in the city had run out of sanitary supplies such as hand sanitizer, masks and antibacterial wipes.
"We are trying to get some products from Amazon but so far they are back ordered as well, or prices are ridiculously expensive," Aleksandr Abdurakhmanov, the supervising pharmacist and owner of Chelsea Royal Care Pharmacy in Manhattan, said on Sunday afternoon.
More than 70 people in the United States have been confirmed through laboratory testing to have the new coronavirus. Many had been passengers on a cruise ship ravaged by the virus or had been infected in China and then returned to the United States.
But there have also been several confirmed cases of person-to-person spread in the United States. And researchers say that in Washington State the virus may have been spreading for weeks, largely undetected, and that hundreds of people may have possibly been infected. Two people in Washington have died after falling ill with the new coronavirus.
The new virus is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading to more than 50 other countries. More than 86,000 people have been infected, and more than 2,800 have died. New hubs of transmission have emerged in Italy, South Korea and Iran.
Iran, the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East, has officially confirmed 987 cases, state news media reported.
New York officials have said for weeks that it was inevitable that the virus would show up in the city.
In a statement issued late on Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said the city's health officials had "been in a state of high alert for weeks, and are fully prepared to respond."
Little is known about the woman other than the fact she was one of two people who the city's Health Department said on Sunday was being tested for the virus.
Earlier on Sunday The New York Post reported that Mayor de Blasio had described the two people who were being tested as a couple who had recently been to Iran. The other person's results have not yet been announced.
Over the last month, there have been obstacles to widespread testing that may have limited the ability of the authorities to detect cases. Until this weekend, New York State health authorities could not test patients locally and had to send samples to the C.D.C. Because of the C.D.C.'s narrow parameters on who was eligible for testing, the number of people tested was quite limited.
Over the previous month, only nine people in New York City had samples sent to the C.D.C. for testing -- all were found not to have the virus. But testing procedures changed over the weekend, when the Wadsworth Lab in Albany began administering coronavirus tests after receiving permission from the federal government.
In addition to faster turnaround, New York's health authorities now have more control over who is tested, which could lead to far wider testing than has occurred so far.
"We're closely watching as the situation evolves, and as we brace for the possibility for community transmission here in New York City," a spokesman for New York City's Health Department, Patrick Gallahue, said. "And if a change in criteria is needed, we'll seek it."
The authorities in New York have said they are prepared for the arrival of the virus. In New York City, some 1,200 hospital beds could be made available to coronavirus patients without interfering with anyone else's medical care, Mayor de Blasio has said.
Coronaviruses have been behind other dangerous outbreaks in recent decades: SARS in 2002-03 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which was first reported in 2012.
New York had a close call with SARS. A doctor in Singapore who had been infected with SARS while treating patients flew to New York City in 2003 for a conference. He grew increasingly ill while in New York, eventually cutting short his trip and boarding a flight for home.
The new coronavirus appears to be less lethal than SARS or MERS, but it is spreading more quickly.
The symptoms of the new coronavirus can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the C.D.C. While the illness is mild in some patients, others have pneumonia and respiratory failure.
Katie Van Syckle and Luis Ferré-Sadurní contributed reporting.

Texto completo: The Week in Tech: Coronavirus Disrupts the Industry
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello there, loyal technology newsletter subscribers. It's Mike Isaac, tech correspondent for The New York Times, bringing you this week's news digest. Let's dive right into it.
The biggest story of the moment is the rapid spread of the coronavirus, which can cause a potentially fatal flulike illness and originated in China. The virus -- and the global attempts to contain it -- has rocked the business world, sending financial markets into correction territory, down more than 10 percent.
In the tech industry, companies with direct exposure to China were the earliest to feel the effects. Apple, for instance, warned investors that the supply of iPhones -- the company's marquee product, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue every quarter -- would be hampered by the spread of the coronavirus. Apple relies heavily on factories in Shenzhen, China, and Chinese consumers are an enormous segment of the company's customer base.
Days later, Microsoft rang the alarm bell. The tech giant depends on customers who install its Windows software on laptops and Surface tablets, and both of those hardware products are also being hammered by closings and slowdowns in China. Personal computing accounts for roughly a third of Microsoft's revenue.
While hardware companies seem to be the most obvious candidates to face trouble, the impact is starting to ripple outward to other, less obvious internet companies.
Expedia, the travel aggregator, declined to provide a full-year financial outlook because of the coronavirus' disruption of travel. Companies like Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing giant, have started providing drivers with plastic barriers to place between the front and back seats, offering another layer of protection from the virus.
Dun & Bradstreet, the business research firm, said about 51,000 companies had one or more suppliers in regions of China affected by the virus, almost certainly leading to a broader impact in the months ahead.
To try to keep their employees safe, some companies are taking preventive measures. Organizers called off MWC Barcelona, the annual global telecommunications trade show in Spain. But the giant RSA security conference still went on in San Francisco this past week, even though big companies like IBM, AT&T and Verizon pulled out of it.
Facebook canceled one of its advertising events, which is attended largely by employees, and its annual F8 conference -- one of the company's most anticipated events. That's where it showcases its products and plans for the future to software developers. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, is a mainstay at the event, giving a regular state-of-the-industry keynote address.
Karen Weise, my colleague in Seattle, had this tidbit to share: Employees at Amazon's worldwide operations -- the company's largest division, which runs the technology and operations for warehouses, deliveries, Prime membership and physical stores, among other things -- were told that they should not travel domestically or internationally "until further notice," according to emails viewed by The New York Times.
Dave Clark, the senior vice president who runs worldwide operations, wrote in one of the emails that no group or team meetings requiring travel should be planned until at least the end of April, "by which time hopefully we have a better sense of the virus, its spread and impact."
Amazon confirmed that Mr. Clark had emailed his organization on the matter. "We are watching this situation closely with a focus on the safety of our teams and ensuring we can meet customer promises," an Amazon spokeswoman, Kelly Cheeseman, said in a statement. "We are closely following local and international health authority guidance as this situation progresses."
The company had already been scrambling to make sure it doesn't run out of popular products that are made in China, and has urgently emailed suppliers to see if they expect to have enough of their best sellers for its all-important Prime Day this summer.
Rather than forecasting the apocalypse, I've been engaging in a different thought exercise over the past few weeks: What less obvious companies might the coronavirus affect in ways we hadn't anticipated?
Will Netflix, for example, see a drastic uptick in hours of streaming television watched, given people aren't leaving their homes anymore? Or consider delivery companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Instacart, even Amazon. In a world where people are increasingly hesitant to go outside and mingle with others, will consumers start to rely more heavily on others doing the shopping for them?
Investors seem to be doing the same: Shares in Zoom, the teleconferencing software company, skyrocketed over the past week as more white-collar workers telecommute from home.
I find this Zoom anecdote highly relatable. I've sent my boss more Slack and G-chat messages in the past few weeks than I can remember ever sending before.
Some stories you shouldn't miss
Intuit, the tax-preparation and financial-data company, announced a $ 7.1 billion deal to buy Credit Karma, a major move into creating a financial-services and personal-data-collection behemoth. The idea is to serve as a kind of online financial assistant for people, our reporters Nathaniel Popper and Michael de la Merced wrote, helping consumers get their credit scores, file their taxes and find new loans and other financial products.
Uber plans to start paying drivers to display advertising on digital signs mounted to the tops of their cars, because apparently not enough surfaces in the world contain advertising on them.
LinkedIn is testing its own "Stories" product, hopping on the bandwagon of companies that have ripped off Snapchat's pioneering way of showing disappearing status updates to friends and followers.
Speaking of Expedia: The company slashed more than 3,000 jobs, about 12 percent of its work force. An internal email announcing the move said the cuts were due to Expedia's history of pursuing growth in an "unhealthy and undisciplined" way.
Bob Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, abruptly stepped down, replacing himself with another Bob (Chapek, who ran the company's entertainment theme parks division). Though Mr. Iger had long expressed his desire to leave the company, spectators immediately wondered what his next move would be. A Democratic vice-presidential pick, perhaps?
And finally, if you somehow missed it, you absolutely have to read The Wall Street Journal's corker of a story on the cutthroat squabbles at the top of SoftBank, the Japanese megaconglomerate, which has billions of dollars in investment spread throughout Silicon Valley and beyond. Having started making waves in the Valley years ago, SoftBank has fallen from grace in recent months after some of its highest-profile investments have turned out to be flops.

Texto completo: A sick day? Remote work? Not so easy if your job is at a restaurant, a day care center or a construction site.
Stay home from work if you get sick. See a doctor. Use a separate bathroom from the people you live with. Prepare for schools to close, and to work from home. These are measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.
Yet these are much easier to do for certain people -- in particular, high-earning professionals. Service industry workers, like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy, are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.
The disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Covid-19, harder to contain in the United States than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say. A large segment of workers are not able to stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.
"Very quickly, it's going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones," said Dr. James Hadler, an epidemiologist who was Connecticut's public health director and is now is a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones, and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others, and to share bathrooms.
Unequal access to precautionary measures cuts along the same lines that divide the United States in other ways: income, education and race.
"It's definitely an equity issue," said Alex Baptiste, policy counsel for workplace programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group. "You have not just an economic disparity but also a racial disparity between who has that access and can take care of themselves and their families."
Portia Green, 33, is a restaurant worker in New York. She has no paid sick leave or health insurance. If schools closed, as a single mother she'd have no child care. A day off work means losing around $ 100 in pay, she said, and if she had to take more than a few days off, losing her job. The restaurants she has worked for are too understaffed to call in backup workers easily, she said, and the expectation is that you show up unless you're "green."
"They're going to push you to do it anyway," said Ms. Green, who is a member of Restaurant Opportunities Centers United in New York, an advocacy group. "You go to work, pop a vitamin C and if you can do it, you do it."
The biggest disparity for workers is access to health care: In the United States, some 27.5 million people lack any form of health insurance. That makes them less likely to seek medical care when they become ill or to have access to preventive health benefits that can help them stave off illness. The uninsured are disproportionately low income.
Workers also have unequal access to remote working. The government recommended that people work from home in a coronavirus outbreak, but just 29 percent of American workers can do so, according to Labor Department data. They are most likely to be highly educated and high earners.
On an average day, 35 percent of the highest earners and 8 percent of the lowest earners spend some time working from home. Managers and professionals are most likely to do so, and service industry and construction workers least likely. Nearly half of workers with a graduate degree do some of their work from home, as do a third of those with a college degree. Just 12 percent of those who didn't attend college work from home.
For many workers, being sick means choosing between staying home and getting paid. One-quarter of workers have no access to paid sick days, according to Labor Department data: two-thirds of the lowest earners but just 6 percent of the highest earners. Just a handful of states and local governments have passed sick leave laws.
Only 60 percent of workers in service occupations can take paid time off when they are ill -- and they are also more likely than white-collar workers to come in contact with other people's bodies or food.
"When you're talking about paid leave and who should stay home, it's the ones who need it most that don't have access to it, the ones showing up at work sick touching your food, touching your bags, coming into everyday contact with your direct life," said Kris Garcia, 43, an airport worker in Denver.
She will not receive paid sick days until she works at her job half a year, and even then, plans to save them for dealing with a chronic disease, hemophilia. "I think people should stay home," said Ms. Garcia, who is helping an advocacy group on issues like paid leave called Family Values at Work. "But I know I'd need my infusions, whereas if I'm coughing and have a fever, I could push through five hours."
Evidence shows that paid sick time reduces the spread of illness. A working paper on state laws that require employers to offer paid sick leave found that statewide influenza infections fell 11 percent in the first year after enactment compared with places that made no such change. An earlier paper, on city laws, showed a similar, but smaller, effect. (There are differences between influenza and the new coronavirus, but the two diseases are transmitted in similar ways.)
"It's very clear: When people don't have access to sick leave, they go to work sick and spread diseases," said Nicolas Ziebarth, an associate professor of economics at Cornell University, who was a co-author on both papers.
Still, paid sick time works only if people take it. Even when workers have paid sick leave, American culture often rewards going to work at all costs. In an average month, one in 10 workers said they needed to take leave but did not, and the most common reason was for their own illnesses, according to Labor Department data.
The top reasons for not taking it when they needed it: having too much work, fearing negative repercussions or being unable to afford a day off.

Texto completo: Readers both applaud The Times's effort to publish more letters from women and call it "political correctness run amok."
Editors' Note: Thomas Feyer, the letters editor of The Times, recused himself from selecting responses to his own article and delegated that role to another editor.
To the Editor:
Re "Women, Please Speak Out," by Thomas Feyer (Sunday Review, Feb. 16), a report on progress toward the goal of parity for women on the letters page:
I spent 18 years as the letters editor at The Calgary Herald. I believe that your obsession with tallying the gender of letter writers to achieve greater parity between men and women is the height of political correctness run amok.
During my tenure at The Herald, I, too, noticed that more men than women wrote letters. However, gender was never among my criteria for publication. Letters that were well written, concise and thoughtful got published in The Herald, regardless of whether a man or a woman wrote them.
My goal for The Herald's letters page was simply to offer a mix of topics and a diversity of opinions each day. The best letters were often the two-line zingers we received from a variety of people indulging in delightfully sarcastic commentary on political and other issues. Men write letters to the editor more often than women. So what? Stop being silly. Just publish the best letters you get, regardless of who wrote them.

To the Editor:
I applaud the Women's Project in its effort to balance representation on the letters page. And I applaud Kimberly Probolus, whose letter inspired the project a year ago. Before we conclude that we can correct that imbalance if more women submit letters and more men listen, I wonder if we haven't simplified the issue.
Why aren't more women offering their opinions on matters of both political and personal importance? Why have women persistently lagged in speaking up?
Could it be that our voices have repeatedly been censored or dismissed by a system in which men still hold most of the power? That women have, in effect, been socialized not to speak because to do so threatens that system?
Women must speak if they want to be heard. And listening is a necessary starting place for men. But to reach gender parity, our society still has a long way to go.

To the Editor:
I would like to share my dismay at the limited coverage (articles and photos) about women in the hard news sections. I love to peruse The Times daily, and often fail to find a photo of a woman and have to wait for the Arts or Style section (soft news) before there is some evidence that women are worth reading and writing about, except as victims.
Women make up half the world, do a huge share of the world's work, take care of children and the elderly, and often lack recognition. Please, let's try to remedy this imbalance. Perhaps more women will write if they see themselves, and their issues and values, more fairly covered in the hard news sections.

To the Editor:
Our father, Kalman Seigel, letters editor of The New York Times from 1967 to 1980, faced the same issue. In the foreword to "Talking Back to The New York Times," a book of letters to the editor from 1851 to 1971 that he edited, he wrote: "Who writes letters to the editor? Everyone does. Surprisingly, there is little formal research information available, although one study of about 10,000 letters shows that men wrote 46 percent of all letters to the editor and women 37 percent -- the others were not identifiable."
He went on to cite a 1964 study published in the Journalism Quarterly indicating that published letter writers were male by a 3-to-1 ratio. Still, in 1971, our dad was proud of The Times's efforts to enhance openness and welcome -- and print -- a diversity of opinion from a diverse readership.
Letters, he wrote, "have given the voices of quiet expression and honest persuasion to masses of men and women in a world that shouts more, but listens less."

To the Editor:
I have a simple solution to the issues undermining goals to achieve gender parity via the Women's Project. Letter writers should be identified simply with a first initial and a last name. Certainly if the content of the opinion "requires" that the letter writer identify as "a mother of three in Milwaukee" or "a gay male bus driver in Los Angeles," then the integrity of the response should be maintained. Otherwise, let the opinion in the letter run on its own merits, without at the end "outing" the letter writer as male or female.
Problem solved?
J. Szymczak

To the Editor:
I applaud the Women's Project. But I think there is another project that needs to be implemented by The Times -- getting more young people to write. When I accepted your invitation to attend a meeting of frequently published letter writers, I was struck not only by the small percentage of women but even more so by the apparent absence of anyone, male or female, under the age of 55. Young voices matter, too, especially as they are confronted with the massive problems their elders have created for them.
The Times needs younger readers, and engaging them seems like an important undertaking when all of journalism is under attack.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Li Yuan writes about the intersection of technology, business and politics in China and across Asia for The New York Times in her column, The New New World. She recently examined the rare public dissent that has emerged in China as residents grow frustrated with the government's response to the coronavirus. In an interview, Ms. Yuan discussed the sadness, anger and resilience of the Chinese people as the country still reels from the impacts of the outbreak.
Walk us through the origins of this backlash.
The night when Li Wenliang, the doctor who tried to warn China about the virus, died, some doctors told Chinese journalists that he died around 9:30 p.m. Then, shortly after, the journalists were told he didn't die. They had used some kind of emergency thing. Then the hospital didn't declare he died until around 3 a.m. I stayed up the whole night when he passed away, and so did many, many Chinese people.
People were speculating the authorities delayed announcing his death because they didn't know how to manage the public anger. From that night on, it seems to me there has been a tug of war between the online population -- the public -- and the propaganda machine. The online revolt was something I had never seen before. I had never seen something so unanimous -- people unanimously sad and angry at the same time. In a previous column, I wrote about investors, venture capitalists, lawyers, not just your elite liberal intellectuals or dissidents. It was very unanimous. People felt like, he was just one of us. He just shared what he knew about this mysterious virus. And then he was punished, reprimanded by the police, and then he caught the virus. People saw themselves in him.
What was the shift that happened at that moment?
There are more people willing to speak out. Especially young people, they're really organizing themselves. I was stunned to find that so many people were just so outspoken, laughing at how ridiculous the party was in trying to spin the huge national disaster into something positive. One blogpost was headlined: "News Coverage Should Stop Turning a Funeral Into a Wedding."
I took so many screenshots -- because posts can disappear in like a minute. Everybody takes a lot of screenshots, and people figured out how to build an online archive of media articles, social media posts and videos outside the Chinese internet, because it's censored. They want to keep records of this collective memory. That feels quite unprecedented.
There are young people online, talking about, "I'm not going to self-censor anymore. Even if my online presence disappears completely, because everybody gets their social media accounts deleted all the time, I don't want to self censor anymore, I want to speak the truth."
Is there still a fear of censorship or punishment?
Everybody is fearful. I would say it's very hard not to live in fear in China.
Why isn't the messaging working this time?
It's not working because I don't think there has ever been any event that has affected everybody -- 1.4 billion people -- everybody has to at least stay at home, not go out, try to find masks, and that has affected everybody. Many people have this question -- why didn't we know this before? Why didn't the government tell us earlier?
People are frustrated. They also read so many heartbreaking stories and watched so many videos and they are just really sad. The party came out like, "Oh these medical workers are so brave -- let's celebrate our unity." Many people are like, "I don't want to do that right now." It's just something everybody has to deal with that. I don't think many people are in the mood of celebrating.
What will the Communist Party do now?
Since Dr. Li's death, they really enhanced the censorship and they are censoring a lot more. So many people's social media accounts have been deleted or suspended. They are deleting a lot more articles. They're sending out a very clear message: We don't want you to talk about the negative effects of this outbreak. We want you to focus on the positive side.
I don't think it's working. Eventually, the government will win, probably because it's just too powerful and they control everything. At the same time, I don't think we should underestimate the anger, frustration and resilience of the Chinese people, especially the young people. Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.

Lizzo Is Countersued Over 'Truth Hurts'

Texto completo: Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who were sued by Lizzo in October, claim that the hit song's key line came from another song they had written with her.
Last year, the song "Truth Hurts," by the R&B and pop singer Lizzo, was one of music's most extraordinary success stories, a two-year-old track that became a No. 1 hit and established Lizzo as a bold and charismatic new star.
The authorship of "Truth Hurts" also became one of the industry's most closely watched controversies, after Lizzo was accused by two songwriting brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, of taking her song's signature boast -- a wisecrack about the results of a DNA test, which itself came from a tweet -- from another song they had written with her, and denying them credit.
Lizzo responded in October by suing the Raisens and another writer who said he was involved in the original track, saying their claims did not have "any merit," and announcing that she would be granting writing credit and royalties to the woman behind the tweet that had started it all. By the time the Grammys came around -- with Lizzo as a top contender -- the controversy around the song was barely being talked about.
But on Friday, the Raisens filed a detailed counterclaim seeking credit and royalties on "Truth Hurts," arguing that their work in a joint early songwriting session set the "DNA test" line to music. If not for the Raisens' work as songwriters and producers in that session, they said in their complaint, "Lizzo would never have collected her Grammy Award," for best pop solo performance on "Truth Hurts."
The Raisens had raised many of their major arguments last year, on social media and in an interview with The New York Times, in which they described that songwriting session, from April 2017 -- about five months before "Truth Hurts" was released. They posted audio clips comparing "Truth Hurts" with the original track they wrote with her, which was called "Healthy."
But their countersuit, filed in Federal District Court in Los Angeles, has far more detail, including excerpts from what it says are Justin Raisen's text exchanges with Lizzo and with her primary producer, Ricky Reed. According to screenshots submitted in the complaint, Reed reached out to Raisen when the song went to No. 1; seeming sympathetic to the Raisens' claims, Reed said he wanted their dispute "resolved."
A representative for Lizzo declined to comment. But in her suit last fall, she portrayed the Raisens and Yves Rothman, another writer who said he was denied credit on "Truth Hurts," as having only "come out of the woodwork" once the song became a hit. "The men who now claim a piece of Truth Hurts," she said on social media at the time, "did not help me write any part of the song."
The case drew wide attention not only because it challenged the authorship of a smash hit -- "Truth Hurts" was No. 1 for a total of seven weeks last year -- but because it shined a light on the tense negotiations that often go on behind the scenes among artists, producers and writers to divide credit and royalties. Writers and their advocates often argue that while pop artists have many opportunities to exploit their fame, songwriters' livelihood is almost entirely dependent on the percentages, or "splits," that they get from contributing to hit songs.
Among the lawyers representing the Raisens is Lawrence Y. Iser, a noted copyright attorney who in 2010 represented David Byrne in a lawsuit against Charlie Crist, the governor of Florida, who had used a Talking Heads song without permission in a Senate campaign ad.
In a statement, Iser called Lizzo "a talented musician and performer who currently enjoys immense popularity based on a hit song that she did not write alone," and said the case had larger ramifications for the music industry.
If the Raisens do not prevail in their effort to gain credit and royalties from "Truth Hurts," Iser said, that "would make it impossible for working musicians to be confident that they will be properly credited for their work if they get into a studio and create songs with powerful artists."

Big Investors Are Recoiling After a Rout On Wall St.

Texto completo: The S&P 500 just had its worst week in more than a decade as investors fretted over the global coronavirus outbreak. The best cure may be time.
Wall Street has often adopted a simple playbook when facing a stock market plunge: "Buy the dip." Not lately.
In recent years, investors who jumped on downturns as chances to buy shares at bargain prices have profited from the move. Their buying, in turn, helped stabilize prices, snuffing out slumps before they morphed into panics.
But last week, as coronavirus cases turned up around the world and new information kept pouring in -- photographs of deserted business districts in Milan, a stark warning from an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday, news that a single Google employee in Switzerland had tested positive for the virus on Friday -- big investors across Wall Street lost their nerve, interpreting the steep fall in share prices not as an invitation to go bargain-hunting but as a reason to dump more stock.
"This is one of the few times in recent history where we've seen them meeting that with selling and not buying," said Mike Lewis, head of U.S. equity cash trading at Barclays, referring to big investors like hedge funds and pension funds that tend to employ sophisticated trading strategies.
The result: the worst weekly rout for stocks since the 2008 financial crisis.
The coming week will be another test for investors. Wall Street culture fetishizes forecasts and figures. Analysts and investors are rewarded for their ability to correctly gauge risk, incorporate those assessments into accurate forecasts and then make trades based on them. As a result, investors despise uncertainty, because it makes it difficult to generate good guesses about the future.
And uncertainty is pervasive right now. The coronavirus -- highly contagious, with new cases emerging daily, and millions still facing lockdowns in the world's second-largest economy, China -- is creating exactly the kind of unpredictability that makes investors fret. There is little clarity about how long it will take governments and health officials to contain the virus, leading to a gloomy prognosis for global economic growth. Supply chains remain deeply disrupted. Consumer spending may suffer if daily life is disrupted by the virus.
Markets are as precarious as they've been since stocks started climbing in March 2009 after the financial crisis. In such cases, investors tend to sell to limit their losses or wait for clarity to emerge, which could take weeks, if not months.
"You need to show that the virus is under control," said Jack Janasiewicz, a portfolio manager with Natixis Investment Managers. "Until that happens, we're going to be in these volatile swings."
But instead, federal health officials have warned that the virus will spread. Over the coming days, Americans will probably hear updates on new infections, and perhaps deaths. (The first reported virus death in the United States, of a man in Washington State, was announced on Saturday.)
Already, during last week's panic, updates on even a single new infection were at times enough to move multitrillion-dollar financial markets. The most recent economic data has been bleak. Official Chinese surveys of activity in the factory sector released over the weekend, showed even deeper contraction than expected.
The jitters could continue.
"Anytime you see another headline, you almost instantaneously see a reaction in the markets," said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale in New York, said Friday. "Clearly there's a lot of skittishness."
Even if, as is now expected, the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates this month, an action that has been a balm for market woes over the last decade, that may not be enough to put things back on a surer footing.
"The playbook for the last 10 years, you should throw out the window," Alan Fournier, who trades his own money through a family office in Summit, N.J. "Because this virus doesn't care what the Fed does."
Since the 2008 financial crisis ended, America's decade-long economic expansion has hardly been smooth. But when growth faltered, the Fed has reliably stepped in to act -- pumping new money into financial markets or cutting interest rates, or both.
Those actions kept the economy chugging, and helped stocks rebound. The dynamic repeatedly rewarded investors who used market setbacks as buying opportunities.
But this time, traders, investors and analysts expect any action from the Fed to have limited impact, at least on the economy. Unlike previous periods of stress, including the U.S. government shutdown fights in 2011 or the trade war with China that started in 2018, the current crisis of confidence is tied more to epidemiology than economics.
So whether the market turns around depends on those who make health policy and communicate information to the public, rather than officials who determine monetary policy.
The Fed can still help calm market fears to some extent. On Friday, a brief statement from the Fed that it stands ready to support the economy helped the market rally off the worst of its lows. More soothing words could come in the days ahead, potentially reversing some of last week's decline in stocks.
But even if markets see a short-term bounce, it could take longer to restore the investor confidence -- or complacency -- that pushed stocks to record highs a little more than a week ago. After all, investors just endured the second-worst week for the S&P 500 stock index since 1941 and one the fastest 10 percent declines on record. Nose dives like that are psychological events for investors as much as financial ones.
"The positive economic outlook that people had for 2020 and beyond that was not realistic," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. "The coronavirus helped bring that down and the stock market helped bring that down. But I don't think you can put Humpty Dumpty back on the wall again."
What's most needed, investors say, is time. It will take weeks before the American public and investors have enough information to know if the country is facing significant economic disruption from the outbreak or a relatively benign scenario in which the spread of the virus is relatively quickly brought under control. It will also take weeks before the impact of the outbreak appears in economic data. Analysts will watch government economic reports for indications that news coverage of the virus, and the market's tumble, spooked shoppers and threatens consumption, the main engine of U.S. growth.
"It is not the kind of thing that the market will quickly bounce back from," said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an analyst with Barclays in New York. "They will need to see evidence through the passage of time."

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the Democratic presidential race Sunday, ending an improbable and historic campaign that cemented the gay former South Bend, Ind., mayor as one of the party's young stars, but which struggled with the candidate's short political resume and his lack of popularity with voters of color.
He narrowly won the Iowa caucuses and finished a close second in the New Hampshire primary. But poor showings in the next two contests, in Nevada on Feb. 22 and Saturday in South Carolina, suggested there was no plausible route to the nomination.
Buttigieg announced the decision Sunday night in a speech to supporters and staff in South Bend.

His departure just two days before Super Tuesday will probably boost other moderate candidates' hopes of finally assembling a coalition large enough to compete with the progressive base backing Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
"The truth is the path has narrowed to the close for our candidacy," Buttigieg said in his suspension speech, adding that to defeat President Trump, "We must recognize that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with [our] goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party together."
It had been an uphill climb from the beginning for Buttigieg, 38, who launched his candidacy from relative obscurity from South Bend, a Rust Belt city of about 100,000 people that had been on an economic upswing since the start of his eight-year tenure in 2012.
Not since the nomination of diplomat and Solicitor General John W. Davis in 1924 has the Democratic Party selected a candidate who had not previously won a statewide election as either governor or U.S. senator. Buttigieg had previously run for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 and lost both races handily.
But the Republican Party's nomination and election in 2016 of Donald Trump, who had no experience as a public servant, had broadened voters and experts' perspectives on what was possible in a presidential nominee. The Democratic Party, still reeling from the loss, was undergoing an identity crisis and had no clear leader, which ultimately led more than 20 candidates to plunge in.
Buttigieg surged past multiple governors and senators through successful early media appearances on CNN and the liberal podcast "Pod Save America," where the former Rhodes scholar and Navy intelligence officer impressed many listeners with the nimble and clear speaking style that would become the hallmark of his public appearances.
Buttigieg's youth presented a stark contrast to the septuagenarians leading the Democratic field. He pitched himself as a liberal who was moderate enough to bring in independents and disaffected Republicans disgusted by Trump's brash presidency.
The fact that he was a gay man from conservative Indiana lent historical weight to his presidential candidacy, which was a first for the Democratic Party; his husband, Chasten, a public school teacher, would become a cultural figure in his own right.
"I told Pete to run because I knew there were other kids sitting out there in this country who needed to believe in themselves too," Chasten Buttigieg said at his husband's suspension speech Sunday night.
Buttigieg's advisors sensed his unique biography and self-discipline would be a strength on the campaign trail, and -- in contrast to candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden -- they made the South Bend native as accessible to journalists as possible.
The strategy helped boost his media profile on the cheap, and campaign contributions followed as big-dollar Democratic donors were particularly taken by Buttigieg, whose endorsers included Hollywood celebrities such as Kevin Costner and Mandy Moore. He also drew the support of prominent LGBTQ entertainers such as George Takei and Ellen DeGeneres.
The donations enabled Buttigieg's campaign to swell to hundreds of paid staff and compete against his higher-profile and well-financed opponents, but also marred his image as the Midwestern mayor-next-door after images leaked of a posh campaign fundraiser in a Napa Valley wine cave.
The fact that Buttigieg was even accepting large donations and holding private fundraisers in the first place marked an ideological departure from his fellow millennials, who were increasingly turning toward the kind of economic populism espoused by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and who became some of Buttigieg's harshest critics.
Buttigieg struck increasingly moderate positions as the campaign wore on, criticizing big left-wing ideas such as universal free college and a single-payer "Medicare for all" healthcare system, which Buttigieg rebranded as a less aggressive "Medicare for all who want it" public option. His campaign defended him from attacks from progressives by arguing that he was running to the left of Hillary Clinton's 2016 platform.
His political inexperience also drew concern, particularly from critics who wondered if a woman with a similarly short resume would have gotten similar attention and credibility. "Could we be running with less experience than we had? I don't think so," Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told the New York Times. "I don't think people would take us seriously."
Ultimately, perhaps the issue that did the most damage to his campaign was Buttigieg's failure to draw support from voters of color, not just nationally, but in his hometown. Although many black leaders in South Bend expressed their support for Buttigieg's presidential candidacy, he had also been distrusted and outright disliked by some residents for his handling of the city's police department.
Shortly after arriving in office in 2012, Buttigieg fired the city's black police chief, who was accused of improperly recording police colleagues who were allegedly making racist remarks. The number of black officers in the department dwindled dramatically during Buttigieg's tenure.
Those tensions exploded into the open during Buttigieg's campaign in June 2019, when a white officer shot a black man who the officer said threatened him with a knife. The officer's body camera wasn't on, leaving the incident shrouded in uncertainty.
Buttigieg stayed in the race and won a very narrow victory in Iowa over Sanders and came in second in New Hampshire.
For months, Buttigieg's campaign had proceeded with the theory that his problem with voters of color was not dislike or distrust, but a lack of name recognition or excitement. They hoped that strong performances with white voters in Iowa and New Hampshire would swing open the door to Latinos in Nevada and, hopefully, black voters in South Carolina.
But by Saturday, it was clear that the campaign's grand strategy had failed. Sanders won the Latino vote in a decisive victory in Nevada, and Biden gave a similarly commanding performance in South Carolina, where it was estimated that Buttigieg had support from only 2% of black voters.

Texto completo: In a century of American wars, none has been quite so invisible to the public. Americans don't want to fight in Afghanistan, they don't want to die there and they don't really want to hear about it. Why? This war is different.
U.S. Troop Levels and Living Veterans for Each War
Fewer American troops have fought in Afghanistan than in any American war in the last century. At most, about 12,000 American troops remain there now and a total of about 600,000 have rotated through over 18 years.
That number is less than a quarter of those who fought in Vietnam and about half the number who went to Iraq, where more troops fought and died in less than half the time, increasing the visibility of their sacrifices.
Fewer troops serving means fewer veterans. Even today, the number of living veterans of World War II and the Vietnam War each exceeds the number of Afghan war veterans.
That matters because living veterans are a potent lobbying force in keeping a war alive in the public consciousness. As the number of living veterans declined after 1946, the American sense of the presence of war as measured by veterans has steadily diminished.
In the years immediately after World War II, 15 percent of the population had recently returned from a war. Today, that number is about 2 percent.
Civilian and U.S. Casualties by War
A big contributor to rendering the Afghanistan war invisible has been the success at minimizing casualties, particularly military casualties.
A series of new military medical protocols -- honed by experience in the last couple of wars and by advanced battlefield trauma techniques and rapid medevac capacity -- has created the concept of "the golden hour."
"The golden hour" has been astoundingly successful in saving troops' lives. It emphasizes getting wounded service members to a trauma care facility within an hour, and immediate first aid to keep them alive for that long. The result has been so successful that an American soldier was more than five times as likely to be killed in each of the first four wars of the last century than in Afghanistan.
And while even Afghan allies have criticized the United States about killing civilians, far fewer civilians have died in Afghanistan than in any previous war involving American forces.
U.S. Yearly War-Related and Total Defense Spending
Afghanistan has been every bit as expensive as any war in the last 75 years, with the exception of World War II. The United States has spent $ 2 trillion over 18 years.
But that amount is dwarfed by the overall defense budget during that period. Military spending has continued to rise, nearing its levels during World War II, even as the United States has reduced its involvement in Afghanistan.
Much of that money has gone toward expensive showcase, high-tech projects -- popular with communities back home where they create jobs -- like the $ 400 billion F-35. And foreign policy priorities have shifted to the Persian Gulf and the South China Sea, each demanding expensive naval commitments, at a time when both China and Russia are spending heavily on projecting power and influence in new regions.
Yearly Front-Page Headlines About War
Despite the costs, the war in Afghanistan has mostly remained in the back of the nation's consciousness. In recent years, the war was the subject of fewer front-page articles in The New York Times than any other war since World War I. After an initial spike in coverage following the Sept. 11 attacks, the war in Afghanistan rarely appeared more than once a week on the front page.
The New York Times is not exceptional. If anything, The Times has invested more resources in covering the Afghan war than any other Western news organization in Kabul, where it maintains the largest foreign bureau.

Rice University asks "small group" to self-quarantine due to employee's possible exposure to coronavirus

Texto completo: Coronavirus in Texas
The latest updates on Texas coronavirus cases: Texas has 11 known cases — all of them in the San Antonio area, as of March 2, 2020. All of those were instances of people who got the disease overseas and are now at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease. More than 120 people are set to be released from quarantine in San Antonio on Tuesday, March 3.

Saying the move was out of an abundance of caution, Rice University on Saturday asked a "small group of students and faculty" to self-quarantine because a university employee might have been exposed to the new coronavirus while traveling overseas.
The university didn't identify the person but said that they are a research staff member who had contact with a possible positive case of the virus. The person's "contact with the Rice campus was limited and occurred on Monday and Tuesday of last week," the university said in a campus-wide alert Sunday. The university didn't say where the employee traveled — other than that it was not to a country on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's restricted travel list.
"Rice public safety officers learned of the case on Saturday afternoon and took immediate action to ensure the safety and well-being of those involved and the broader Rice community," the university said in the alert.
The university said it's not planning to suspend campus operations, events or classes. The staff member has not had direct contact with undergraduate students and has not been in a residential college or classroom since returning to Houston, the university said.
"Only one individual is being investigated by public health authorities, but out of an abundance of caution, Rice has identified those persons on our campus with whom there was direct contact, and we recommended that the 17 individuals self-isolate and follow heightened precautions in locations off the main campus," the alert said. "Those self-quarantined include faculty, doctoral students and staff. We are working closely with them to ensure their safety and well-being."
As of Sunday, there have been 74 confirmed cases of the virus in the United States, according to The New York Times. Eleven of those have been in Texas — all of them in San Antonio where federal officials have set up a quarantine at Lackland Air Force Base for people returning to the country from high-risk areas. State health officials say the risk for average Texans remains low.
Still, worries about the virus continue to spread. On Sunday, CERAWeek 2020, an international energy conference in Houston, was canceled "in light of developing circumstances." Delegates from more than 80 countries were expected to attend the event, which was scheduled for March 9-13.
"Our number one concern is the health and safety of delegates and speakers, our partners, our colleagues and vendors," said the event organizer, IHS Markit, in a statement. "We have spent the last several weeks focused on this question, established a medical partnership with Houston Methodist Hospital, have been in continuing dialogue with experts on infectious disease, and established an extensive protocol. But the spread of COVID-19 is moving quickly around the world.
At Rice, officials are requiring anyone at the school who travels overseas to notify the university. Those who travel to places where the risk of contracting the virus is elevated are being asked to stay away from the university for two weeks.
"We understand that the Rice community will be rightfully concerned," the university said. "The safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty and staff are our highest priority."

Climate research must be objective, reliable

Texto completo: Seventeen-year-old Greta Thunberg has been making international headlines passionately advocating for action on climate change. Millennials and many younger people are embracing climate change and seem equally enamored with the prospect of socialism. Could there be a connection?
Let's reminisce a bit.
A 1970 Boston Globe headline read "Scientist predicts a new ice age by 21st Century." In 1972 a Brown University letter to the president read "The present rate of the cooling seems fast enough to bring glacial temperatures in about a century." In 1974 the Guardian reported "Space satellites show new Ice Age coming fast" while 1976 saw the publication of "The Cooling" by Stephen Schneider.
Then in 1988 the Miami Herald reported "88 on way to be hottest ever as world temperatures up sharply." "Prepare for long, hot summers." In 1989, Salon asserted New York's "West Side highway will be underwater by 2019" and in 2000 "Children just aren't going to know what snow is."
Among these and other climate predictions were headlines such as "It's already too late ... the time of famines is upon us ... most disastrous by 1975." Then 1980 had "Acid rain kills life in lakes." And then "'Great peril to life'; Gas pares away earth's ozone."
After 60 years of crying wolf we're now told "climate change" - a conveniently amorphous term - is today's existential planetary crisis. Those who followed and remember these headlines might be forgiven their skepticism.
Platitudes issued by politicians at international climate conferences and command and control policy proposals such as the "Green New Deal" only add to the suspicion that there is more to the story.
Indeed, the late Charles Krauthammer and others suggested the reality of market capitalism, "where just the partial abolition of socialism lifted more people out of poverty more rapidly than ever in human history" led to the demise of the various iterations of collectivism and left progressive social planners, intellectuals, experts and their political allies homeless.
Like rats from a sinking ship, leftists found a new nest - in the environmental movement. Now they will, per Krauthammer, "regulate your life not in the name of the proletariat or Fabian socialism but - even better - in the name of the Earth itself."
Britain's Prince Charles, insulated (as most leading environmental pontificators are) from the consequences of his assertion, said "The price of capitalism and consumerism is just too high." Hmmm. The "wolf" that's going to finish us off is capitalism.
With movie stars and other wealthy advocates jetting around while preaching about carbon emissions, it appears - certainly at the leadership level - environmentalism has more hypocrites than idealists.
Still, irrespective of ideology and despite the fact past apocalyptic prophesies have proven false or overblown, prudence requires rational consideration of the impact of mankind's actions on our world.
Continued research must be objective and reliable - not driven by politics or other agendas. If true scientific consensus suggests urgency and an abundance of caution, then nuclear power generation must be fundamental to the solution.
The New York Times wrote in 2016 nuclear power is "the only technology with an established track record of generating electricity at scale while emitting virtually no greenhouse gases."
Nuclear energy is also the answer that buys time for other technologies, including those uncompetitive but for taxpayer handouts - for example, wind, solar, ethanol - to develop as free markets continue providing increasingly widespread prosperity.
Those predicting impending environmental and social catastrophe while rejecting the nuclear solution are not serious or have ancillary agendas.
And if you think the environment is in crisis or filthy today, wait until you have the progressive or socialist "solution."

Texto completo: If you thought Hillary Clinton has slipped into oblivion, just book a room at the same hotel she's staying in.
The day before her appearance at the Television Critics Association press tour in January to promote the new movie "Hillary," the former secretary of state's presence was everywhere. At one point, Secret Service agents at Pasadena's Langham Hotel seemed to outnumber the maids.
Right before the news conference the next morning, the moderator announced that the Q&A would not be followed by the usual "scrum," an almost comical routine in which reporters storm the stage to get their 20 seconds of one-on-one time with the stars.
"I was sort of looking forward to the scrum," Clinton said, eliciting some laughs.
The four-hour documentary, which premieres Friday on Hulu, is determined to expose that human side of a polarizing figure.
Filmmaker Nanette Burstein makes sure to include moments that would normally be left on the cutting-room floor: Clinton getting makeup applied, rehearsing a Saturday Night Live" sketch with Kate McKinnon, doing an impression of former U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel. She's more blunt in her criticism of Bernie Sanders than she ever has been. Through her lens, the Oscar-nominated director tries to show how political pressure and chauvinistic swipes robbed us of getting to know that version of Clinton.
If she has come across as a stiff, or even coldhearted, during her career, it's only because we made her that way.
"I'm sorry if I'm not brilliantly charismatic on TV, but I am the same person I've always been," Clinton says in the first of four episodes. "Going through this gantlet of unbelievable obstacles, yeah, you get scarred up a little bit."
"Hillary" captures lots of moments on the campaign trail that male candidates would never face: Why are you wearing purple instead of more patriotic colors? You need to smile more! How dare you not leave that two-timing husband of yours!
New York Times reporter Amy Chozick summarizes the message she heard again and again while covering the 2016 presidential campaign.
" 'I want to vote for a woman, just not that woman,' " she says in the documentary. "Well, did 30 years of sexist attacks make her that woman?"
Burstein spends most of the project arguing that it did.
She leaves little time for a rebuttal. Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is one of the few Republicans to make an appearance, and he's only around long enough to confirm that Clinton was a swell egg.
It's up to Clinton to serve as her own harshest critic. You can imagine how that goes.
While she makes a number of apologies, there's always a caveat. Yes, it was a mistake to lead the health care initiative in the '90s, but that's only because too many Americans weren't ready for a first lady to assume so much power. Yes, maybe I should have left my dog of a husband after the Monica Lewinsky affair, but can you imagine how much heat you would have given me if I hadn't stood by my man?
"Hillary" isn't exactly a puff piece, but it's not terribly interested in being objective, either. If you're one of those who chanted "Lock her up," you're not suddenly going to give her the key to the city.
But for those who supported her presidential bid, or have been on the fence about her legacy, "Hillary" is a bit of revelation.
Turns out she's likable enough -- as long as the person behind the camera is an unabashed fan.

Texto completo: Based on the tone of Tuesday's Democratic debate, you'd think the Kremlin has already determined the outcome of the presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Russians are "engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our election." Billionaire Tom Steyer said there is "an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now." Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg charged that Russia was backing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to ensure a Trump victory.
Clearly, the Russia scaremongering is in full swing. Last week's intelligence testimony that the Kremlin is backing President Donald Trump made headline news. Another report emerged alleging Moscow is backing Sanders. Biden claimed that Bernie-backing Russian bots have been attacking him on Facebook. And Hillary Clinton told a foreign audience that "Russians are back in our cyber systems," and that "anyone who tries to deny it" is living in a "sad dreamworld."
Moscow no doubt is up to something, seeking to create chaos and discredit democracy. So are other malign actors. But it is safe to say the greatest practical effect Russia will have is serving as a narrative platform for Americans to generate increasingly strident headlines, tweets and sound bites discrediting the election. This will happen whether Russian President Vladimir Putin lifts a finger or not.
First, let's acknowledge that Moscow's attempts to undermine American democracy did not start in 2016, or even back in the 1980s when Sanders was there on his honeymoon. Interference in foreign politics has been a fixture of the Kremlin's foreign strategy for 100years. These efforts have had no discernible impact on American politics.
There is no reason to suspect Russia will improve its record in shaping American elections. The Mueller report detailed the efforts of Kremlin-linked activists to interfere in the 2016 election, but it did not conclude that these crude propaganda efforts influenced the outcome whatsoever. We should balance our legitimate concern that the Russians are trying to sway the electorate with the knowledge that they are not very good at it.
Even so, technology has made these influence operations easier to execute. Social media has empowered superficial and emotional messaging regardless of the source. And Americans hardly need Moscow to push divisive ideas. Any glance at Twitter reveals how bitter our politics has become.
Yet the Russian interference narrative has become entrenched.
When intelligence community election expert Shelby Pierson speculated to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting that Russia was trying to help President Trump get reelected, it quickly leaked, became a front-page story in The New York Times and precipitated the usual outrage. It took a few days for the less dramatic truth to catch up – that there was no evidence for the "misleading" supposition the Kremlin is pro-Trump.
It is not clear how Russia would benefit from a Trump second term anyway, since the first one has not worked out well for them. President Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, expelled Russian diplomats, sent arms to Ukraine, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, undercut Russia's natural gas markets in Europe, pursued nuclear modernization while not rushing to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and even killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria.
It is also a mistake to blame only Russia for bot campaigns and other forms of election interference. Any foreign government with a grudge against America could be at it. Iran has already tried to hack into the Trump reelection campaign. China may also be involved in seeking to influence the U.S. election.
When incidents take place leaving behind evidence of well-known Russian cyberespionage groups like Fancy Bear, it could well be hackers from other countries trying to cover their tracks. Even Americans could be exploiting the climate of Russophobia.
The United States should remain aware that malign groups, both foreign and domestic, will seek to exploit the increasingly shrill information domain to tilt the election playing field one way or the other. Forewarned is forearmed.
Nonetheless, Americans should not make it easy for them. We play into the hands of these groups by overreacting to the latest shiny stimulus thrown into the media ecosystem. In that sense, the real problem is much bigger than the Russians; the problem is us.

Yet the Russian interference narrative has become entrenched.
When intelligence community election expert Shelby Pierson speculated to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting that Russia was trying to help President Trump get reelected, it quickly leaked, became a front-page story in The New York Times and precipitated the usual outrage. It took a few days for the less dramatic truth to catch up — that there was no evidence for the "misleading" supposition the Kremlin is pro-Trump; at best Russia may have a "preference" for a "deal-maker."
It is not clear how Russia would benefit from a Trump second term anyway, since the first one has not worked out well for them. President Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, expelled Russian diplomats, sent arms to Ukraine, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, undercut Russia's natural gas markets in Europe, pursued nuclear modernization while not rushing to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and even killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria.
Those who accuse the president of being a Kremlin asset should seriously rethink their premises.
It is also a mistake to blame only Russia for bot campaigns and other forms of election interference. Any foreign government with a grudge against America could be at it. Iran has already tried to hack into the Trump reelection campaign. China may also be involved in seeking to influence the U.S. election; it was recently accused of election meddling in Cambodia and Indonesia.
When incidents take place leaving behind evidence of well-known Russian cyberespionage groups like Fancy Bear, it could well be hackers from other countries trying to cover their tracks. Even Americans could be exploiting the climate of Russophobia to try to hack the election and escape undetected.

Market panic means little for those left out of stock gains

Texto completo: Monday's 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America's real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors and enabling President Donald Trump to claim that "our economy is the best it has ever been." Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what's happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market," says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. "But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What really matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education."
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 per hour, picking up trash from sports fans who may pay hundreds of dollars to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single mothers in the United States, 29% live in poverty. Most do not have college educations and could not afford one even if they wanted a four-year degree.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with ever higher deductibles and co-pays.
Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, today's stock market decline does mean a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce, not counted in official unemployment statistics. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can't afford to rent a small apartment.
Andrew L. Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter and history professor who writes frequently on the socioeconomic difficulties of struggling Americans, including in his recent book, "Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life."

No, Trump didn't call the coronavirus a 'hoax'

Texto completo: It can pretty much be taken for granted that liberals in the national media are dishonest whenever they're pretending to be outraged over something President Trump says, but every now and then, it's good to revisit how truly deranged they can be.
Case in point, both Paul Krugman at the New York Times and Dana Milbank at the Washington Post asserted in the past few days that Trump called the coronavirus a "hoax."
Here's Krugman on Thursday: "So, here’s the response of the Trump team and its allies to the coronavirus, at least so far: It’s actually good for America. Also, it’s a hoax perpetrated by the news media and the Democrats."
And here's Milbank: "Now Trump faces his first major crisis. And he’s ... holding a political rally where he calls the coronavirus a 'hoax.'"
The president, of course, never called the virus a hoax.
What he said at a campaign rally last week was, “Now, the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus," and, "One of my people came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.' That didn't work out too well. They couldn't do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. And this is their new hoax.”
Both the Times and the Post have running tallies of Trump's "lies." Maybe they should start one for their own writers.

Bernie Sanders's war on charities

Texto completo: In 1981, when Bernie Sanders was serving as mayor of Burlington, Vermont, the current front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination shocked the crowd gathered to kick off the annual Chittenden County fundraising drive for the United Way when he declared, “I don’t believe in charities.” The mayor, according to a New York Times account, went on to take issue with the “fundamental concepts on which charities are based,” asserting that government should instead be the provider of social services.
What was then a fringe view (in a country that would give more than $400 billion to charities in 2018) would take on the force of tax law, were a Sanders administration to prevail. That’s thanks to the candidate’s proposals to hike tax rates on the affluent and, crucially, to impose for the first time a tax on assets (a “wealth tax”) in addition to one on income. The combination would deeply wound charitable and philanthropic giving, which is dominated by the well-off. It would not only leave less income for potential charitable gifts but would tax wealth that has been pledged but not yet transferred to foundations, universities, or any other nonprofit organization. Like so many other Sanders proposals, it would make the United States look more like Western Europe, where charitable giving (as in Germany) is less than a third of that here. And it’s premised on a false equivalency — that government can and would do the same things and do them as well as charitably funded civil society.
To understand the impact of the Sanders income tax and wealth tax proposals on charity and philanthropy, one must understand that the wealthy are disproportionately the source of both. Williams College economist Jon Bakija has found (in 2009) that those earning more than $200,000 comprised just 2.6% of the population but accounted for more than 29% of charitable giving. The 2018 tax reform law has likely concentrated such giving even more — since only 13% of households now itemize their tax returns and can avail themselves of the charitable tax deduction. Before tax reform, more than 30% itemized. But the rich are different here: Among the wealthiest 5% of people, 72% itemize — and, in light of the limitation of such deductions as that for state and local taxes, may see in charity a still-unlimited tax break.
But a Sanders wealth tax would be a game-changer, especially on top of higher tax rates which will limit the amount of discretionary income available for all purposes, including charitable giving. (One wonders whether he’d even try to get rid of the charitable deduction entirely, in keeping with his 1981 remarks.)
An excellent new National Taxpayers Union Foundation research paper analyzes the Sanders wealth tax, which would range from 1% on assets starting at $32 million to 8% for assets of more than $10 billion. In finding that the wealth tax “would have massive implications for American altruism,” economists Andrew Wilford, Andrew Moylan, and Jacob Plott note especially the potential for the assets of foundations to be taxed because of the link between pledged wealth by such donors as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and the link with the direction of such donors — such that the foundation assets might be lumped together with the overall Gates’ billions. Their research estimates that the Gates Foundation could face a wealth tax of $3.8 billion per year, compared to the total of $4.5 billion in grants it made in 2018. The paper sees similar implications for the Dell Foundation, (Ray) Dalio Philanthropies, and the Omidyar Foundation, based on the eBay fortune.
As the paper puts it, “A wealth tax,” whether that of Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who has her own version, “would throw a wrench into the worlds of any foundation or donor seeking to maximize charitable impact” and “would introduce a layer of tax planning that would significantly distort their incentives.”
All this for a revenue increase characterized as a “drop in the bucket” compared to current and potential federal spending, especially the eye-popping new totals for "Medicare for all" and free college, child care, and pre-K, as per Sanders.
One has to believe that all this is worth it because the monies that federal government “loses” to the charitable deduction and related giving incentives could be put to better use by government, no matter how much it is. But this is the fundamental error of the Sanders worldview.
Philanthropically supported efforts by superdonors such as Gates or Peter Thiel can be seen as a sort of national venture fund, allowing a small percentage of GDP to be used for ideas that don’t have to pass a political test. What’s more, civil society groups (small and local) are more likely to focus on shaping values than on providing social services. In my book, Who Killed Civil Society?, I call this an emphasis on the “formative” rather than the “reformative.” This is the difference between the YMCA and the Boys and Girls Clubs (both of which are locally funded) and the Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, there is value for the social fabric in the local organizations that bring together volunteers — such as those who no doubt were in attendance at that 1981 Burlington event where Sanders spoke.
Perhaps Sanders went on to say that charity was necessary prior to the arrival of the socialist utopia. But that is a day that will never come. Government simply can’t replace charity — and that which charity supports.

Texto completo: Attorneys for Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann announced that they were filing lawsuits against five additional media outlets.
Sandmann was accused of harassment after he was photographed sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat while standing in front of a Native American man, Nathan Phillips, with a smirk on his face in Washington, D.C., last year. It was later revealed that the student did nothing inappropriate during the exchange, despite several major newsrooms reporting otherwise.
His attorneys notified the court on Feb. 23 that they intended to file lawsuits against the New York Times, Gannett, ABC, CBS, and Rolling Stone. All of the lawsuits will be formally filed by March 9.
“All of the future defendants listed above have published or republished statements made by Nathan Phillips and others that Nicholas blocked or otherwise restricted Phillips’ free movement and would not allow Phillips to retreat at the National Mall on January 18, 2019. Nicholas reserves his right to file complaints in this is Court or any other court against any other potential defendant not listed above, subject to the applicable statute of limitations,” Sandmann’s attorneys argued in the letter to the court.
Sandmann has two outstanding lawsuits against the Washington Post and NBC Universal. He already settled one other lawsuit with CNN for an undisclosed sum. The original request from CNN was a $275 million settlement, but it is not clear what the final agreement was.
The teenager was in Washington, D.C., to participate in the March for Life when the photograph of him and Phillips was taken. He was accused of cornering Phillips while he played a tribal drum, but footage of the full encounter revealed that Sandmann had not blocked or harassed Phillips in any way.

Texto completo: When Meet the Press host Chuck Todd today repeatedly challenged Vice President Mike Pence to “name some names” of Democrats or media figures politicizing the coronavirus to damage President Trump, Pence gave just one example before he was cut off.
CHUCK TODD: Because this is just — it just feels like gas-lighting. Please name some names. I’m — we're all big — we're all big people here. Name some names.
VP MIKE PENCE: There was a column in the New York Times by a prominent liberal journalist that said, "We should rename it the Trump virus." --
TODD: Okay, that is — does that apply, does that apply to all people …
Tweet
Under fire all day in the media for its handling of the coronavirus, a plan put in place six weeks ago that has included flight bans from infected areas, the Republican National Committee late today fired back with a list of at least 14 examples of prominent media and Democrats using the virus to hit the president.
Tweet
“While President Trump has directed the full resources of the federal government to combat Coronavirus, Democrats and the Sunday shows have not followed President Trump’s call to not incite panic. For President Trump’s opponents, Coronavirus is sadly their latest cudgel to hit President Trump. It’s disgraceful and must end immediately,” said Steve Guest, the RNC’s rapid response director.
Tweet
Throughout the day, he kept adding to a Twitter thread with examples from Politico, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Todd, State of the Union host Jake Tapper, and 2020 candidates Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg.
The fight has been escalating all week but took off when acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said that the media and Democrats hope that the virus will end the Trump presidency.
Tweet
“The reason they are paying so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to bring down the president, that’s what this is all about,” said Mulvaney at last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference.
Trump later expanded on that theme, calling the effort to hit him over the virus the latest “hoax” to take him down.
Pence did not back off in his interview.
TODD: This doesn't help. This does not help us no?
PENCE: This is decisive action to protect the American people. And when you see voices on our side pushing back on outrageous and irresponsible rhetoric on the other side, I think that's important.
Tweet
TODD: Do you think this rhetoric from your side helps?
PENCE: I, I never begrudge people responding to unwarranted, unjustified attacks. But I promise you, we're going to continue to focus on the mission the president's given this taskforce and given this government. And that is, we're going to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear. And the American people, the American people can be confident that we're going to continue to work this issue. We're going to work with leaders in both parties in Congress to make sure that not only our federal agencies have all the resources they need, but our state and local governments, healthcare providers have the resources and the support to provide the care that every American would want. Remember, Chuck, this is about the lives of the American people.

Texto completo: NBC host Chuck Todd claimed Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans are gaslighting the public about Democrats blaming President Trump for the coronavirus.
Several Republicans, including Trump, have accused Democrats of using the coronavirus as a club to hit the White House rather than expressing concern about the situation. During a Sunday interview on Meet the Press, Todd asked Pence to explain why some Republicans were making such statements.
“What facts are there that Democrats are doing this?” Todd asked. “It seems like people are asking questions and are concerned about the virus. This implies some sort of political motivation, which is kind of gross.”
Pence responded, “I will tell you, there’s been a lot of irresponsible rhetoric among Democrats and commentators on the Left.”
“Name some names, sir,” Todd said. “Because this is just — it just feels like gaslighting. Please, name some names. We’re all big. We're all big people here. Name some names.”
Pence referenced a New York Times article by Gail Collins that suggested the coronavirus should be renamed “Trumpvirus” as one example. Todd conceded that as an example but continued to confront Pence, saying, “Does that apply to all?”
“I never begrudge people responding to unwarranted, unjustified attacks,” Pence said. “But I promise you, we are going to continue to focus on the mission the president's given this task force and given this government, and that is, we’re going to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear.”
So far, more than 88,000 people have been infected with the coronavirus, which is also called the COVID-19 virus, since the outbreak began in 2020. Nearly 3,000 have died from the disease, including one man in the United States.

Fox News legal analyst: Trump libel lawsuit against the New York Times is ‘dead on arrival’

Texto completo: President Trump’s libel lawsuit against the New York Times has no hope of moving forward, according to a Fox News legal analyst.
The president’s campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times over a story that was published in the opinion section of the newspaper. Trump accused the outlet of “intentionally publishing false statements” about his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the article. Mercedes Colwin, a legal analyst for Fox News, brushed off the lawsuit as “dead on arrival.”
“This case is D.O.A., dead on arrival. Why do I say that? When you have a libel case, especially against an op-ed editor, the very nature of an op-ed is that it’s opinion. There’s lots of well-settled law that says when you’re expressing an opinion, you are devoid of making a defamatory statement,” Colwin explained on the network Sunday.
She continued, “And even when — president said at that press conference that, well, he got the opinion wrong. Well, by his own admission, you’re talking and criticizing an opinion. The case law is very clear. When you express an opinion, you’re not actually making a statement that’s defamatory.”
As Colwin noted, Trump said in a press conference on Wednesday that the New York Times story was “beyond an opinion” and claimed there would be “more” lawsuits coming against the newspaper or other outlets for their coverage. Colwin argued that Trump was trying to use the lawsuits as a “deterrent” but added that she doesn’t believe it will “stop anything” because the lawsuit will likely be dismissed by the courts.
Trump’s lawsuit referenced an article by Max Frankel, who was the executive editor of the New York Times from 1986 to 1994, in which he accused Trump of having “an overarching deal” with "Vladimir Putin's oligarchy." Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation revealed last year no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians in 2016, though the Kremlin did meddle in the election via other methods.

Sanders and Biden both know that Democrats are probably screwed

Texto completo: To watch Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders back to back Sunday on ABC's This Week was to essentially watch the Democratic Party fall apart before it even gets to nominate a presidential candidate.
The party right now is facing two massive problems: unremarkable voter turnout and no contender who is a clear favorite.
Turnout so far has looked exactly like 2016, despite Sanders promising to motivate a hidden swath of voters who want free health insurance, free child care, and free college education.
The New York Times reported last week:
Despite a virtual tie in Iowa, a narrow victory in New Hampshire and a big triumph in Nevada, the first three nominating contests reveal a fundamental challenge for Mr. Sanders’s political revolution: He may be winning, but not because of his longstanding pledge to expand the Democratic base. The results so far show that Mr. Sanders has prevailed by broadening his appeal among traditional Democratic voters, not by fundamentally transforming the electorate.
In other words, there's no reason to believe Sanders has any better chance at beating President Trump than any other Democrat, even if he is the one with the most votes within his party. At this point, they might as well be nominating Hillary Clinton again.
Sanders himself knows this is a problem. When he was asked about it on This Week, he could only offer a "guess" that his campaign has "an excellent chance to win some of the largest states in this country and states all across this country because of the coalition that we’re putting together, because of the issues that we’re talking about.”
This is what we call wishful thinking.
As for their second problem, Biden, who came into the race with a 20-point national lead, only to see his chances quickly slip away with every poor debate and primary (other than South Carolina, which he won), gave the most uninspiring answer for why he should be the nominee.
"Because I can win and I can bring along Democratic victories up and down the state[s]," he said. "I can keep the United States Senate — I can win the United States Senate at the top of the ticket. I can keep the House and increase the number in the House. I can go into every state in the nation. I can go into purple states, and we can win. I can win in places where I don’t think Bernie can in a general election."
That's not a case for why he should be president. That's a case for why he should be endorsing someone who he thinks should be president.
And this is to say nothing of the growing panic that the party might end up at its convention this year and no candidate has secured a majority of delegates.
It's a mess, and both Biden and Sanders know it.

Texto completo: A few months ago, I wrote a column saying I would vote for Elizabeth Warren over Donald Trump. I may not agree with some of her policies, but culture is more important than politics. She does not spread moral rot the way Trump does.
Now I have to decide if I’d support Bernie Sanders over Trump.
We all start from personal experience. I covered the Soviet Union in its final decrepit years. The Soviet and allied regimes had already slaughtered 20 million people through things like mass executions and intentional famines. Those regimes were slave states. They enslaved whole peoples and took away the right to say what they wanted, live where they wanted and harvest the fruits of their labor.
And yet every day we find more old quotes from Sanders apologizing for this sort of slave regime, whether in the Soviet Union, Cuba or Nicaragua. He excused the Nicaraguan communists when they took away the civil liberties of their citizens. He’s still making excuses for Castro.
To sympathize with these revolutions in the 1920s was acceptable, given their original high ideals. To do so after the Hitler-Stalin pact, or in the 1950s, is appalling. To do so in the 1980s is morally unfathomable.
I say all this not to cancel Sanders for past misjudgments. I say all this because the intellectual suppositions that led him to embrace these views still guide his thinking today. I’ve just watched populism destroy traditional conservatism in the GOP. I’m here to tell you that Bernie Sanders is not a liberal Democrat. He’s what replaces liberal Democrats.
Traditional liberalism traces its intellectual roots to John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Social Gospel movement and the New Deal. This liberalism believes in gaining power the traditional way: building coalitions, working within the constitutional system and crafting the sort of compromises you need in a complex, pluralistic society.
This is why liberals like Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Warren were and are such effective senators. They worked within the system, negotiated and practiced the art of politics.
Populists like Sanders speak as if the whole system is irredeemably corrupt. Sanders was a useless House member and has been a marginal senator because he doesn’t operate within this system or believe in this theory of change.
He believes in revolutionary mass mobilization and, once an election has been won, rule by majoritarian domination. This is how populists of left and right are ruling all over the world, and it is exactly what our founders feared most and tried hard to prevent.
Liberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism. Liberalism is horrified by cruelty. Sanders’ leadership style embodies the populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarization, a demand for ideological purity among your friends and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.
A liberal leader confronts new facts and changes his or her mind. A populist leader cannot because the omniscience of the charismatic headman can never be doubted. A liberal sees shades of gray. For a populist reality is white or black, friend or enemy. Facts that don’t fit the dogma are ignored.
A liberal sees inequality and tries to reduce it. A populist sees remorseless class war and believes in concentrated power to crush the enemy. Sanders is running on a $60 trillion spending agenda that would double the size of the federal government. It would represent the greatest concentration of power in the Washington elite in American history.
These days, Sanders masquerades as something less revolutionary than he really is. He claims to be nothing more than the continuation of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. He is 5% right and 95% wrong.
There was a period around 1936 or 1937 when Roosevelt was trying to pack the Supreme Court and turning into the sort of arrogant majoritarian strongman the founders feared. But this is not how FDR won the presidency, passed the New Deal, beat back the socialists of his time or led the nation during World War II. FDR did not think America was a force for ill in world affairs.
Sanders also claims he’s just trying to import the Scandinavian model, which is believable if you know nothing about Scandinavia or what Sanders is proposing. Those countries do have generous welfare states, but they can afford them because they understand how free market capitalism works, with fewer regulations on business creation and free trade.
There is a specter haunting the world — corrosive populisms of right and left. These populisms grow out of real problems but are the wrong answers to them. For the past century, liberal Democrats from FDR to Barack Obama knew how to beat back threats from the populist left. They knew how to defend the legitimacy of our system, even while reforming it.
Judging by the last few debates, none of the current candidates remember those arguments or know how to rebut a populist to their left.
I’ll cast my lot with democratic liberalism. The system needs reform. But I just can’t pull the lever for either of the two populisms threatening to tear it down.

Texto completo: Alice Wolowitz, a student nurse, began her shift at a hospital one morning in Philadelphia. She fell sick during the shift, rapidly declined and was dead that night.
That was 1918, and people were collapsing and dying everywhere from a Spanish flu pandemic. Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals were full and turning away patients, who offered huge bribes to get in. Police officers with surgical masks were sent to pick up bodies from homes, but 33 police officers died within weeks.
“In virtually every home, someone was ill,” John Barry wrote in his book about that pandemic, “The Great Influenza.” “People were already avoiding each other, turning their heads away if they had to talk, isolating themselves. The telephone company increased the isolation: With 1,800 telephone company operators out, the phone company allowed only emergency calls.”
Sports events were canceled. Theaters closed. Shaking hands was made illegal in Prescott, Arizona. Philadelphia hurriedly set up six more morgues. Families put crepe paper on doorways to signal a death inside — and crepe was everywhere.
That Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, which killed at least 50 million people worldwide, has been the bench mark for pandemics ever since. For decades public health experts have called for preparations for another “big one” — yet adequate preparations were never made.
Nobody knows if the coronavirus will be a “big one,” for it may still fizzle. As of this writing, only one person is known to have died from it in the United States, while thousands routinely die annually from the seasonal flu. But increasingly, experts are saying that we should get ready just in case.
“Are we seeing a replay of 1918?” asked The New England Journal of Medicine, a publication not associated with alarmism. Bill Gates, who for years has been warning presciently about the danger of pandemics, bluntly cautions that this virus could be a “once-in-a-century pandemic.”
“I hope it’s not that bad, but we should assume that it will be until we know otherwise,” Gates said, and that seems prudent.
While figures are uncertain, the coronavirus may kill 2% of those infected; if correct, that would be similar to the lethality of the 1918 flu (it’s also possible that many more people are infected without significant symptoms, which would make the death rate quite a bit lower). Another similarity with 1918 is that the United States and the world are unready for a pandemic.
“We’re amazingly unprepared,” Dr. Irwin Redlener, a Columbia University professor and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, told me.
President Donald Trump exaggerates threats from caravans of migrants or from a hobbled Iran, and he has diverted billions of dollars from the military to build a border wall that smugglers hack apart with $100 saws. But he has not been attuned to pandemic threats: In 2018 the White House removed the position on the National Security Council to fight pandemics, while seeking to scale back anti-pandemic work to about 10 countries from 49. Experts warned at the time that this was dangerously shortsighted.
At a time when we need wise, scientifically informed leadership, we find ourselves with a president with little credibility and an antagonistic relationship with scientists. It doesn’t help that during the Ebola crisis of 2014, Trump was one of the most fiery critics of evidence-driven policies that actually succeeded in ending the outbreak.
The United States is also vulnerable because of long-standing deficiencies in our health care system. We are the only major rich country without universal health insurance and paid sick leave, and we have fewer doctors per capita than peer countries.
Consider a Florida man, Osmel Martinez Azcue, who returned from China and found himself becoming sick. As The Miami Herald reported, he might normally have gone to a drugstore and bought over-the-counter flu medicine. But because of the risk of coronavirus he did the responsible thing and sought medical attention: He went to a hospital for testing. In the end, it turned out not to be coronavirus — but he was billed $3,270.
We must ensure that no one is deterred from seeking help by the costs. The White House and Congress should immediately establish a system to ensure that patients need not pay for coronavirus testing and treatment. We should also ensure paid sick leave. Do we really want to go to a restaurant where a coughing, sneezing food preparer still goes to work out of financial need?
William Haseltine, president of a think tank called Access Health International, told me that a vaccine might take at least six to eight months to develop and test — some other estimates are longer — and this should involve an immediate federal investment through Project BioShield. We also need better diagnostics and treatment as well as more ventilators to keep people alive.
Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, an expert on global health at Baylor University, emphasized to me the need to support front-line health workers and keep them from becoming infected.
“If we see a situation in the U.S. like we saw in Wuhan — more than 1,000 cases among hospital workers and five or six deaths — it’s game over,” he said. “Health workers lose confidence, and things start to fall apart.”
Hotez said that one crucial step is simply ensuring that all health workers have enough personal protective equipment.
We may also have to think about reducing occasions when people are crowded together; that may mean more people working from home to avoid offices, buses and subways. It may mean avoiding sports events, school assemblies, parties and even unnecessary visits to crowded doctor’s offices; this is a time to develop telemedicine.
I have two family graduations this spring, and who knows if they will take place? Experts can’t answer the questions that we all have, but they say that we will get through better if we make preparations while relying on science and evidence rather than on muddled political leaders trying to talk up markets or score political points.
The legendary Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist and Nobel Prize laureate, once said that in the struggle against new diseases, “It’s our wits versus their genes.” If we want our wits to triumph, we will need to think clearly, prepare for the worst — and do better.

Texto completo: Washington • Donald Trump was right.
Germs are scary.
For three decades, I talked to Trump about his fear of germs. When I interviewed him at the Trump Tower restaurant during the 2016 race, the famous germaphobe had a big hospital-strength bottle of hand sanitizer on the table, next to my salad, ready to squirt.
He told me about the nightmarish feeling he had when a man emerged from the bathroom in a restaurant with wet hands and shook his hand. He couldn’t eat afterward.
Today, in a stunning twist of fate, germs are infecting his presidency and threatening a bad prognosis for his reelection prospects.
Trump is the first president to use the stock market as a near-daily measure of his success — and his virility — and now the market is slumping. If you want to own it on the way up, you have to own it on the way down.
Investors, who worried when Trump began to rise in politics, soon realized that he had their backs. He was just a corporate vessel pretending to be a populist; the stock market was his sugar high.
Now Trump is learning the hard way what my fatalistic Irish mother taught me: The thing you love most is the first to go. As Mike Bloomberg points out, investors have factored in Trump’s incompetence, and that is contributing to the market cratering.
The president urged the Fed to do something soon to mitigate the stock market losses. Socialism for the rich!
The scaremonger in chief has been downplaying the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic and joining Fox News hosts in accusing the “anti-Trump” media and “Do Nothing Democrats” of scaremongering about the virus.
At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mick Mulvaney told a cheering crowd that impeachment was the “hoax of the day” and now the press thinks the coronavirus “is going to be what brings down the president.” The media, he said, should spend more time on positive stories, like the president’s “caring” relationship with his teenage son, Barron Trump, even though White Houses usually frown on stories about young presidential offspring.
Mike Huckabee went on the attack, asserting that Trump “could personally suck the virus out of every one of the 60,000 people in the world, suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out, and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean.”
On Fox, Donald Trump Jr. said the Democrats “seemingly hope” the virus kills millions to stop Trump’s winning streak. Rush Limbaugh chimed in that the media “would love for the coronavirus to be this deadly strain that wipes everybody out so they could blame Trump for it.”
There are 2,800 dead worldwide and disturbing stories showing how federal criteria delayed the diagnosis of a California woman and how federal health employees interacted with Americans who had possibly been exposed to the virus in China without proper training or gear.
Yet Trump seems more consumed with how the Democrats might blame him for a coronavirus recession than with the virus itself.
Trump had tweet-shrieked at President Barack Obama about how he should handle Ebola. (“Obama should apologize to the American people & resign!”)
Yet he was so relaxed about the coronavirus threat that he spent 45 minutes Thursday chatting in the Oval with the authors of a little play called “FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers,” inspired by the texts of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. The play’s leads, Dean Cain of “Superman” fame and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” actress Kristy Swanson, were also in the meeting. Trump joked that he’d be willing to be Cain’s understudy, the actor said. The president got together the same day with a group that included his social media boosters Diamond and Silk.
At the White House press conference, Trump preened, “Because of all we’ve done, the risk to the American people remains very low.” He later said that one day, like a miracle, the virus “will disappear.”
His top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, pushed the crisis as an opportunity: “Stocks look pretty cheap to me.”
Trump won’t be able to deflect and project and create a daft alternative narrative. The virus won’t respond to conspiracy theories from Limbaugh or nasty diatribes from Sean Hannity or nicknames from Trump.
This will be a deus ex machina test of Trump’s authoritarian behavior. Epidemics are not well suited to authoritarian regimes and propaganda, as we saw last week when Beijing’s use of propaganda tactics to suppress information about the outbreak failed spectacularly and when Iran tamped down news about the virus for political reasons even as it ravaged top officials.
The reality of the coronavirus spreading will reflect poorly on Trump — his cavalier dismantling of vital government teams for health response and his disdain for experts and science.
Trump tried to make federal agencies complicit in his fabulist hogwash about the size of his inaugural crowd and the path of Hurricane Dorian. It is unlikely that he will be able to keep his insatiable and insecure ego in check long enough to give the nation the facts, reassurance and guidance it needs about the infection.
Trump is already doing his orange clown puffer fish routine, acting as if he knows more about viruses than anyone, just as he has bragged that he knows more about the military, taxes, trade, infrastructure, ISIS, renewables, visas, banking, debt and “the horror of nuclear.”
He appointed Mike Pence to be point man, even though, as the famously homophobic governor of Indiana, Pence helped make the HIV epidemic there worse by substituting moral pronouncements for scientific knowledge. Coronavirus Czar Pence spent Friday at a $25,000-a-plate dinner in sunny Sarasota, Florida, raising money to try to win back the House, The Tampa Bay Times reported.
Trump’s history in business — he makes people feel good for a while, and then it ends badly — could presage a stock market crash before he exits.
And it’s conceivable that a crash — along with hospitals being overwhelmed by the uninsured — could lead to the election of a real populist promising Medicare for All.
And that would be a very Trumpian arc indeed.

MULTISTATE INVESTIGATION OF JUUL COULD MEAN A SETTLEMENT SOONER THAN LATER, EXPERTS SAY 39 STATES, INCLUDING EIGHT WHO ALREADY SUED JUUL, BAND TOGETHER

Texto completo: If there was any question whether states wanted to push Juul, the company blamed for the teenage vaping epidemic, into a global settlement as they have with Big Tobacco and are currently doing with opioid-related companies, the announcement of an investigation agreement by 39 states put that to rest.
The agreement - trumpeted as a "bipartisan multistate investigation" by the attorneys general - is likely to "ramp up the pressure," as Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro put it in his press release Tuesday announcing the state's participation, and hasten the move from court to settlement with Juul, experts said.
"Thirty-nine states are taking part. That fact alone just ups the stakes exponentially for Juul and increases the incentive for them to reach a universal settlement," said Doug Blanke, executive director of the Public Health Law Center, an anti-tobacco advocacy group based in St. Paul, Minn.
Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University and an expert on the politics of state attorneys general, noted, "It was already bad enough when big states like California, New York and Pennsylvania had gone after them.
"Now [Juul] is in some real trouble now with 39 states coming after them together," he said. "It creates even more pressure to settle."
One aspect that could be significant, said Tina Batra Hershey, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, is that all the first eight states but one (Arizona) have Democratic attorneys general. Getting 39 states involved shows it's clearly now a bipartisan issue.
"I think at this point we're at that stage in this process that there is enough feeling that this [vaping] goes across party lines and is a national problem," Ms. Hershey said.
While other companies sell vaping products, Juul controls about 75% of the emerging U.S. market, having sold about $3.4 billion worth last year.
"It's understandable the focus of state lawsuits is Juul," said Dennis Henigan, vice president for legal and regulatory affairs for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. "Because Juul almost single-handedly created this epidemic of youth addiction that's caused such enormous social harm."
Since Juul is now one-third owned by Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, it could be expected to fight like a Big Tobacco company "tooth and nail" in the lawsuits filed by the eight states, including Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Mr. Blanke said.
But the sheer number of state attorneys general now using "pre-litigation discovery powers that counties" and private attorneys don't have could prove daunting, he pointed out.
That has already started to happen in the initial eight state lawsuits.
Although the suits all share a common theme of Juul improperly targeting teenagers with deceptive advertising and misleading sciences, each so far has had new wrinkles.
Massachusetts, for example, dug into Juul's online advertising and found the company had bought ads on kid-friendly websites for both the Nick Jr. and Cartoon Network channels - revelations that brought even further condemnation.
In its standard response since it was first sued by North Carolina in May, Juul said in response to Massachusetts' lawsuit that it wanted to work with attorneys general and others ". to combat underage use and transition adult smokers from combustible cigarettes."
An official from the Massachusetts attorney general's office quipped if the goal was to get a 40-year-old mother of two to stop smoking cigarettes, rather than advertise on Nick Jr. and Cartoon Network, the company would be better off advertising on The New York Times website.
Pennsylvania's lawsuit, filed Feb. 10 in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County, drilled into two aspects of Juul's science and advertising that had not been as thoroughly explored before.
The first was taking a closer look at how Juul depicted its nicotine "absorption rate" - a measure of how fast the nicotine that users inhaled from vaping got into a person's body. The state's lawsuit documents how Juul not only allegedly was intentionally misleading with its packaging in-formation but also obscured data in its patent application.
In another section of the lawsuit, Pennsylvania explained how Juul, in its early promotional efforts in 2015, targeted towns in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania by offering people free samples at Sheetz, Wawa and Rutter's convenience stores.
Using young attractive models, the lawsuit points out, the company's representatives set up tables with samples of Juul products, offering free puffs so people could see how it works, how it tastes and the effect it had, and then gave them for free the rest of the pod that held the nicotine liquid to take home.
"It's a highly engaging method of marketing," said Joe Swartz, deputy attorney general with the Tobacco Enforcement section of the office, who is the lead attorney for Pennsylvania's case. "It puts the products and paid spokespeople in confined spaces near candy and soda, places kids go."
Kar-Hai Chu, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who has studied social media's role in the popularity of vaping among teenagers, said the lawsuit agrees with research he and others have found.
"We know that Juul has targeted kids on social media, and study after study shows they had an impact" on kids vaping, he said. "It wasn't about trying to find a 55-year-old 20-year smoker and getting them to quit."
The issues Mr. Shapiro's lawsuit focused on "are targets we as researchers have focused on."
Neil English, instructional principal at Riverview School District's junior/senior high school in Oakmont, who has overseen his school's anti-vaping efforts, was glad to see the state file its lawsuit, and not just because it might bring Juul to change its ways.
"It helps, because any sort of negative pressure against the vaping industry is good," he said. "Just having the medical issues [from vaping lung injury cases in the past year] in the press in recent months has helped kids understand that it's not safe."

Cal Thomas: The Russians are coming (again)

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, “they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump re-elected.” The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump’s re-election. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Trump? That would be the self-described Democratic Socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" />
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) The New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it’s out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian “collusion” narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how they supposedly intend to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Putin’s press secretary told Russian state-run media, “This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth.”
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year’s election should Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach, not only his 2016 election, but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy. That’s why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn’t recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America’s “faults” have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush’s administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the deaths of many in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like a setup and an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup poll shows record high approval (49 percent) of the president’s policies. Forty-three percent of independents polled now support the president — the highest percentage during Trump’s entire presidency. We’ll see if that translates into Republican victories in races for the Senate and House.
According to Gallup, “The latest survey finds a further increase in national satisfaction, with 45 percent now satisfied, the highest since February 2005.”
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall “The Gingrich who stole Christmas” line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s. Democrats have also demagogued Republicans for not helping the poor and for being racist. That is a harder sell with the African-American unemployment rate at record lows and wages rising for virtually all groups. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty level is as low as its been in 11 years.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

Tal vez sea cierta la leyenda de los cocodrilos que habitan las alcantarillas de Nueva York

Texto completo: Por décadas, una leyenda ha circulado por Nueva York: la presencia de cocodrilos en las alcantarillas de la ciudad.
Dicen que son grandes y albinos, debido a la falta de luz solar , pues nacen y pasan toda la vida nadando por los intestinos de la urbe, debajo de las agitadas calles.
También dicen que se alimentan de ratas y desechos de basura, y que aterrorizan a los trabajadores del alcantarillado que, aunque nunca los hayan visto, les temen.
Estos cocodrilos pueden ser el mito urbano más arraigado de la ciudad, ha impregnado la cultura pop y se ha convertido en un tema recurrente en libros, programas de televisión y películas.
Ese mito centenario ha generado engaños y proyectos de arte. Incluso se ha convertido en un cuasi festivo informal en la ciudad: el “ Día del Cocodrilo en el Alcantarillado” es el 9 de febrero.
Pero los cuentos son más o menos ciertos, pues la ciudad rescata a varios cocodrilos al año, generalmente ex mascotas que han sido abandonadas después de haber superado su linda fase.
Aunque es ilegal bajo las normas estatales y municipales comprar, vender o poseer cocodrilos sin un permiso; lo cierto es que un gran reptil puede aparecer cuando menos lo esperan, y con cada nuevo avistamiento, la leyenda recibe otro impulso.
The New York Times honró esta leyenda haciendo un recorrido por los casos ciertos y míticos que la prensa local ha reportado desde 1907 hasta el presente:

Pence says Trump Jr. 'justified' to claim Democrats hope coronavirus 'kills millions'

Autor: Cummings, William.

Resumen: Last week, Donald Trump Jr. said Democrats hope the coronavirus "kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning."

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday defended comments from President Trump and his supporters accusing Democrats of politicizing the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, including Donald Trump Jr. 's assertion that his father's opponents hope the disease "kills millions" of Americans.
"When you see voices on our side pushing back on outrageous and irresponsible rhetoric on the other side, I think that's important, and I think it's justified," Pence said when asked about the remarks from Trump Jr. and others on NBC News' "Meet the Press. "
Since the outbreak began, Trump has taken fire from liberal pundits, Democrats on Capitol Hill and his 2020 election opponents for comments that appeared to downplay the severity of the threat from the virus, including an assertion that it would simply die out once the weather warms. Critics also accused him of trying to defund programs and agencies designed to deal with exactly this kind of threat.

Globally, there are more than 86,000 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus and nearly 3,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In the U. S. , there are at least 76 confirmed cases, and the first U. S. death was reported over the weekend in Washington state.
On Friday, Trump told a crowd of supporters at a campaign rally in South Carolina that the coronavirus was the Democrats' "new hoax" to use against him – the same term he used for the investigation into Russian election interference and his impeachment. The next day, Trump clarified that he was calling the Democrats' criticism – which he suggested ignored his administration's efforts – a hoax, not the actual virus.
Several of Trump's surrogates took his attacks further.
Right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh said, "It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. " Limbaugh said the virus was "nothing but the common cold" and that concerns about it were driven by "media hype. "
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said, "Democrats are using this for their political gain to try and stoke fear in the American people, which is shameful, wrong, and I think un-American. "
"Anything that they can use to try to hurt Trump, they will," Trump Jr. told Fox News. "For them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning is a new level of sickness. "
In response to those quotes, Pence turned the blame on the president's critics and told "Meet the Press" host Chuck Todd, "there's been a lot of irresponsible rhetoric" among Democrats and commentators.
"Name some names, sir," Todd shot back. "Because this just feels like gas-lighting. Please name some names. "
Pence pointed to a New York Times column written by Gail Collins that suggested the illness should be called the "Trumpvirus. "
Todd pressed Pence, asking him if he considered Trump Jr's. comments "helpful. "
"To have someone advocate that you rename the coronavirus the Trumpvirus is reckless and irresponsible," Pence responded.
When asked about Limbaugh's comments, Pence replied, "I have great respect for Rush Limbaugh, and he's a strong conservative commentator. "
Pence agreed Democrats were trying to politicize the threat.
"And that's why my friends that you just played clips of are pushing back as hard as they're pushing," he said. "It's time for the other side to turn down the volume. "
Like Trump, Pence attributed the coronavirus response criticisms to the opposition's overall distaste for the president.
"Washington D. C. has just become reflexively critical of this president at every turn," he said. "The opposition to this president for the last three years has been unprecedented in my lifetime. "
Criticism of the president's response to the outbreak ramped up during Trump's visit to India last week. The president downplayed the threat, telling reporters the virus was "very well under control in our country" and the "whole situation will start working out," even as a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official warned, "Disruption to everyday life may be severe. "
That same week Trump requested $2. 5 billion in emergency funding from Congress to tackle the disease. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer responded with a proposal to increase the amount to $8. 5 billion.
STOP BUYING MASKS!': Surgeon general says they won't protect from coronavirus
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. , the top Democrat on the health care committee, said the administration's request was "totally inadequate. "
On Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden said the stock market had its worst week since the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, not just because of "the pandemic concern, but the way in which the president is handling this. "
Biden continued his criticism on Sunday, telling CNN, "We knew this was coming back as far as January. They didn't even begin to prepare the testing kits. I mean, this is something that's kind of elementary. "
And he slammed Trump's "hoax" remarks.
"What in God's name is he talking about?" Biden asked. "Has he no shame?"
Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign said the administration's handling of the virus was "inadequate, misleading, and dangerous. "
"You would think that you'd have a president of the United States leading, working with scientists all over the world, bringing people together to figure out how we're gonna deal with this crisis," Sanders said.
Pence said Sunday that when the president tapped him to lead the task force on the virus, Trump told him, "I want you to make it clear that we're all in this together. "
The vice president said he hoped Americans and the country's political leaders would "think of the people that have been impacted in this, in this country and around the world, and find a way to come together. "
"This is no time for politics. "

Texto completo: William Galston's explanation for " Why the Young Back Bernie Sanders " (Politics & Ideas, Feb. 19) can be summed up that their generation got a raw deal. Young adults today are much more willing than were prior generations at the same age to entertain the possibility of radical change, and support Sen. Sanders as a leader who will make that happen.
Mr. Galston misses the gross malfeasance on the part of educators who failed to provide a relevant frame of historical reference for what they now consider to be a grossly unjust and irresponsible nation. Were things that much better for young adults who graduated from college just before World War I, the Great Depression, World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War?
Young adults today received a steady diet of social-justice, secular-progressive and climate-change dogma from grade school to graduate school. The New York Times 1619 Project that repackages American history as four centuries of white, male privilege and exploitation of all others is the latest example of an agenda-driven story peddled to a more diverse generation split between guilt-ridden whites and victims of white privilege.
If you are blessed to be born in a country that has outperformed the world for 400 years and still offers better prospects for a comfortable lifestyle than any other nation, and you think the country needs a radical makeover by Bernie Sanders, you were punked by the left-wing ideologues teaching your social-studies classes.
Lou Peters
Savannah, Ga.
Young people have been told all of their politically aware lives that the economy is rigged, the American dream is dead, and "you didn't build that." The idea of success has been replaced with an image of inherent corruption and criminality attributed to all "millionaires and billionaires." They've been told that the world is biased and rife with bigotry, and that they're likely victims whose only hope is to rely on the government to take care of them.
Much of this has been politically expedient rhetoric for the politicians who spout such notions to win elections, but to the young and inexperienced, it appears to have stuck. Is it any surprise, with this onslaught of deliberate negative messaging, that the young support someone calling to overthrow the foundations of America?
John Foster
Portola Valley, Calif.
Where is President John F. Kennedy who exhorted Americans: "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." Today many of the youngest voters in the Democratic Party who support the entitlement policies of Bernie Sanders have turned those words around: Ask what your country can do for you.

No, not Sanders, not ever

Texto completo: A few months ago, I wrote a column saying I would vote for Elizabeth Warren over Donald Trump. I may not agree with some of her policies, but culture is more important than politics. She does not spread moral rot the way Trump does.
Now I have to decide if I'd support Bernie Sanders over Trump.
We all start from personal experience. I covered the Soviet Union in its final decrepit years. The Soviet and allied regimes had already slaughtered 20 million people through things like mass executions and intentional famines. Those regimes were slave states. They enslaved whole peoples and took away the right to say what they wanted, live where they wanted and harvest the fruits of their labor.
And yet every day we find more old quotes from Sanders apologizing for this sort of slave regime, whether in the Soviet Union, Cuba or Nicaragua. He excused the Nicaraguan communists when they took away the civil liberties of their citizens. He's still making excuses for Castro.
To sympathize with these revolutions in the 1920s was acceptable, given their original high ideals. To do so after the Hitler-Stalin pact, or in the 1950s, is appalling. To do so in the 1980s is morally unfathomable.
I say all this not to cancel Sanders for past misjudgments. I say all this because the intellectual suppositions that led him to embrace these views still guide his thinking today. I've just watched populism destroy traditional conservatism in the GOP. I'm here to tell you that Bernie Sanders is not a liberal Democrat. He's what replaces liberal Democrats.
Traditional liberalism traces its intellectual roots to John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Social Gospel movement and the New Deal. This liberalism believes in gaining power the traditional way: building coalitions, working within the constitutional system and crafting the sort of compromises you need in a complex, pluralistic society.
This is why liberals like Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Warren were and are such effective senators. They worked within the system, negotiated and practiced the art of politics.
Populists like Sanders speak as if the whole system is irredeemably corrupt. Sanders was a useless House member and has been a marginal senator because he doesn't operate within this system or believe in this theory of change.
He believes in revolutionary mass mobilization and, once an election has been won, rule by majoritarian domination. This is how populists of left and right are ruling all over the world, and it is exactly what our founders feared most and tried hard to prevent.
Liberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism. Liberalism is horrified by cruelty. Sanders' leadership style embodies the populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarization, a demand for ideological purity among your friends and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.
A liberal leader confronts new facts and changes his or her mind. A populist leader cannot because the omniscience of the charismatic headman can never be doubted. A liberal sees shades of gray. For a populist reality is white or black, friend or enemy. Facts that don't fit the dogma are ignored.
A liberal sees inequality and tries to reduce it. A populist sees remorseless class war and believes in concentrated power to crush the enemy. Sanders is running on a $60 trillion spending agenda that would double the size of the federal government. It would represent the greatest concentration of power in the Washington elite in American history.
These days, Sanders masquerades as something less revolutionary than he really is. He claims to be nothing more than the continuation of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. He is 5% right and 95% wrong.
There was a period around 1936 or 1937 when Roosevelt was trying to pack the Supreme Court and turning into the sort of arrogant majoritarian strongman the founders feared. But this is not how FDR won the presidency, passed the New Deal, beat back the socialists of his time or led the nation during World War II. FDR did not think America was a force for ill in world affairs.
Sanders also claims he's just trying to import the Scandinavian model, which is believable if you know nothing about Scandinavia or what Sanders is proposing. Those countries do have generous welfare states, but they can afford them because they understand how free market capitalism works, with fewer regulations on business creation and free trade.
There is a specter haunting the world - corrosive populisms of right and left. These populisms grow out of real problems but are the wrong answers to them. For the past century, liberal Democrats from FDR to Barack Obama knew how to beat back threats from the populist left. They knew how to defend the legitimacy of our system, even while reforming it.
Judging by the last few debates, none of the current candidates remember those arguments or know how to rebut a populist to their left.
I'll cast my lot with democratic liberalism. The system needs reform. But I just can't pull the lever for either of the two populisms threatening to tear it down.

'We'll get through this': Mike Pence says 'no question' there will be more coronavirus cases

Texto completo: Vice President Mike Pence said Sunday that it is certain additional people in the United States will contract the new coronavirus spreading rapidly across the globe, but he said the risk to the average American remains low and the government is doing "everything possible to prevent the spread. "
"There will be more cases. There's no question," Pence said on NBC News' "Meet the Press. " But, he said, "the vast majority" of Americans who become infected "will be treated, they will recover. "
President Donald Trump has put Pence in charge of a task force charged with coordinating the government's response to the outbreak. Pence stressed that the administration was taking "a whole of government approach. "
"I'll have one of the most renowned experts in infectious diseases literally joining my staff in the West Wing tomorrow. We're going to bring the best scientific minds, experts together," Pence said, "We’re going to work every day to, to contain this disease, to treat those that are contracted. "
"I'm very confident we're ready," he said. "And I know that we’ll get through this. "
Globally, there are more than 86,000 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus and nearly 3,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering. In the U. S. , there are 71 confirmed cases, and the first death was reported over the weekend after a man died from the illness in Washington state.
"It's a tragic loss, and the man passed away," Pence said. "He was an individual we believe in his late 50s that, that also had some other high-risk factors, but it doesn't take away from the tragedy. "
Pence said that of the confirmed cases in the U. S. , "the majority of them are recovering well" and "four remain in serious condition. " He said he would keep those patients "in our prayers. "
When asked about potential school closures in responses to the outbreak, Pence said, "The president would respect any decisions that are made at the state and local level. "
As for whether unnecessary closures or actions by companies might slow the economy after last week's stock market drop, Pence said, "the fundamentals of this economy are strong. "
"The president’s concern is the health and safety of the American people," he added.
In an appearance on "Fox News Sunday," Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the man who died of the illness had been living in a nursing home where there have been additional cases.
"At this point, we do not know how this gentleman contracted the illness," Azar said. He said the man died in a hospital where "the nursing home sends patients. "
Coronavirus: Washington state declares emergency after first patient dies in US
"There are cases in that nursing home also. So right now there's a large investigation going on in the nursing home, the hospital, contact-tracing to try to determine where that disease was introduced and how it might have spread," Azar said.
Like Pence, Azar said the illness would continue to spread.
"We've been very clear from the outset we're going to have more cases here in the United States in spite of the president's aggressive efforts at containment. We'll see more cases. We'll see some forms of community spreading.
"But the risk to any individual American remains low. Thanks to the efforts the president has taken, they stay low. We're working to keep it that way," Azar said. "But things can change rapidly. "
Pence and Azar praised the president's response to the virus and his decision to restrict travel from countries where the outbreak has been widespread. But critics have said the administration was slow to provide resources and accused the president of initially trying to downplay the severity of the outbreak.
Azar said Trump was "trying to keep balance in messaging so that the American people don’t engage in unwarranted panic. "
'No need to panic': President Trump says risk to Americans is low as first coronavirus death reported in US
Several of the president's supporters have accused Democrats of politicizing the disease to hurt Trump, who himself accused the Democrats of creating a coronavirus "hoax. "
Conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh had said that the virus was nothing but the "common cold" and that Democrats were exaggerating the risk it poses to "weaponize" it against Trump. And the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. , said Democrats "hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning. "
Pence defended those comments as legitimate reactions to "irresponsible rhetoric among Democrats and commentators. " When pressed to offer examples of that rhetoric, Pence cited a New York Times op-ed from liberal columnist Gail Collins, who suggested last week that the disease should be dubbed the "Trumpvirus. "
CDC coronavirus testing kit glitches: 'Not gone as smoothly as we would have liked'
'When you see voices on our side pushing back on outrageous and irresponsible rhetoric on the other side, I think that's important, and I think it's justified," Pence said.
"Washington, D. C. , has just become reflexively critical of this president at every turn," Pence added. "The opposition to this president for the last three years has been unprecedented in my lifetime. "
Though Pence defended the remarks from the president and his defenders, he said, "This is no time for politics. "
"Our administration are going to continue to stay focused on the health and safety of the American people. "

Texto completo: COLOGNE, Germany - The last time Henriette Reker ran for mayor, she was nearly killed.
Reker was handing out flowers to voters at a bustling market in Cologne, Germany, in 2015 when a man took a rose with one hand and rammed a kitchen knife into her throat with the other. He wanted to punish her for her pro-refugee stance.
Five years later, Reker is running again. But she is an exception. Since she recovered from a coma to find herself elected, far-right death threats have become an everyday reality, not just for her but for an increasing number of local officials across Germany.
The acrimony is felt in town halls and village streets, where mayors find themselves the targets of threats and intimidation. The effect has been chilling.
Some have stopped speaking out. Many have quit, tried to arm themselves or taken on police protection. The risks have mounted to such an extent that some German towns are unable to field candidates for leadership at all.
"Our democracy is under attack at the grassroots level," Reker said in a recent interview in Cologne's City Hall. "This is the foundation of our democracy, and it is vulnerable."
The trend, local officials and analysts said, reflects a worrying breakdown of civility and political discourse in a polarized Germany, where the insidious influence of an angry far right is changing the rules of behavior.
Mayors have not been the only ones to suffer as Germany's political and social fabric has strained. The shootings last week in the western town of Hanau, near Frankfurt, that left 11 people dead were just the latest attacks aimed at ethnic minorities.
Germans who openly support immigration have been targeted, too. Given the decentralized nature of Germany's political system, local officials like mayors may be the most important among them. Attacks against them take on outsize significance.
Over the last year, there were 1,240 politically motivated attacks on politicians and elected officials in Germany, according to preliminary figures released this year by federal police.
A study conducted by the German Association for Cities and Municipalities showed that 40% of the country's city governments had to contend with stalking, harassment or threats. Of the 11,000 mayors in the country, at least 1,500 reported concrete threats.
And people have died. In June, Walter Lübcke, a regional official, was killed on his front porch by a known extremist, the first far-right assassination of a German politician since World War II.
Supporters of far-right ideology were responsible for more than one-third of the reported episodes, nearly twice as many as were committed by supporters of the extreme left, the government said.
But nearly half of all politically motivated attacks could not be attributed to any specific group, reflecting what experts said showed the erosion of civil norms.
Experts and local officials who have been affected said the violence started when the 2008 economic crisis began to bite. But it took on new dimensions in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the borders to more than 1 million asylum-seekers, most of them Muslim and many fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Andreas Zick, director of the Institute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence at the University of Bielefeld, has been tracking the mood of German society for decades.
He said he first noticed groups of people calling themselves "concerned citizens" who were critical of politicians emerge more than a decade ago.
One of their concerns has now grown into a concerted campaign of hate against local politicians and representatives, he said, driven by populist forces such as the far-right Alternative for Germany, a party known by its German initials, AfD.
"The populists have declared the 'elites' as their enemy, and now we are seeing the rise of this politics of hate which has infected the center of society," Zick said.
Barbara Lücke, the mayor of Pulsnitz in the eastern German state of Saxony, has been targeted by hate campaigns.
"The arrival of the refugees was a catalyst," she said, "but it would have happened regardless."
She attributed the rise in violence to a toxic cocktail of an "anything goes" culture on social media, a dearth of social services and a lack of understanding among Germans in the former Communist East about how a representative democracy works.
"We as a society have lost the ability to respect one another, or those in government," said Lücke, an independent.
"There are no boundaries anymore and no understanding for how to respond when my idea of freedom is in conflict with someone else's idea of freedom," she said. "We have forgotten how to resolve conflicts."
By some accounts, the atmosphere has become particularly toxic in eastern Germany, where the AfD wins on average 1 in 4 votes and many more in rural areas.
Burkhard Jung, the mayor of Leipzig, another eastern city, said that in his first nine years as mayor, he did not get a single threat. But that changed when the country took in the refugees.
"Something broke open then - something came out," he said. "These threats would come. We had to install a security system in our house. Police would sometimes be outside.
"How do you explain that to your children?" he added.
In the five years since she was stabbed, Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said anonymous death threats and constituents writing to say they understand those who want her murdered have poured in.
Shortly after the murder of Lübcke, Reker received a letter signed, "Sieg Heil und Heil Hitler!"
"The phase of cleansing has started," it stated. "Many more will follow him. Including you. Your life will end in 2020."
Last month, she buried a City Hall employee who had been stabbed while on the job.
But Reker has refused to change her message. Just recently she asked the Cologne City Council to approve of a plan to welcome 100 additional refugees and 16 unaccompanied child refugees who are stuck in a camp on the Greek island of Lesbos.
The motion was passed. But in response, a representative of the far-right Alternative for Germany, Sven Tritschler, immediately took to the microphone.
"You have blood on your hands," he said.

Settlers knock holes in Trump's map US plan may not help Netanyahu in Monday's election

Texto completo: YITZHAR, West Bank - For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Donald Trump's recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse.
For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: U.S. recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law.
"The whole narrative has changed," said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar's leadership council. "A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here."
But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements, including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones, as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian ministate, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries.
Standing by Trump's side during the recent rollout of the plan at the White House, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel's election Monday.
But if Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one.
The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel.
"It will be impossible to provide security to the residents," Gavrieli said. "It's absurd. It's another way of saying 'Get up and leave.' "
The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to "Swiss cheese."
Regardless, Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.
Signaling their serious intent, a U.S.-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time last week in the settlement of Ariel.
Yet all this appears to have had little effect on voters.
"It was clearly timed to have a political impact," Reuven Hazan, a political scientist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. "But for all of that, nothing has happened."
Pre-election opinion polls again show Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, in a virtual tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Netanyahu's right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government.
The plan may have helped distract the public from Netanyahu's legal troubles: Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open March 17.
Gantz's endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Gantz as a "Bibi from AliExpress," using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself.
To remain in power, Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself Monday.
In September, more than 58% of Yitzhar's voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of "enemies of Israel," meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries.
But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Netanyahu's pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation.
Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
"In the big picture Netanyahu did great things," said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar's council. "But we'd like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in."
Those, he said, include the recognition that "We are the landlords. It's all our land."
Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984.
Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses.
"Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy," Moshe Goldsmith said. "We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide, and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland."

Texto completo: It hasn't been long since Matthew Cherry, the Chicago native and NFL retiree turned entertainment sensation, won the Oscar for best animated short film for his charming movie "Hair Love," a story about a black father doing his young daughter's hair for the first time.
"Hair Love" was released in theaters in August and came out in December on social platforms. The film has received more than 20 million views on YouTube and has an accompanying picture book that became a New York Times bestseller.
Cherry, who directed and wrote the film, came back to Chicago recently for a screening of the movie and a panel discussion about black hair and black beauty. He was joined on the panel by Caroline Robinson, a cosmetic dermatologist; Ebony Jamison, a beauty, fashion and lifestyle blogger; and Amina Smith of Stadium Sports Network, who moderated the discussion.
Cherry sat down with the Tribune to talk about his Oscar win and what's next for him. The conversation has been edited for space and clarity.

Watching you and Sony executive and producer Karen Rupert Toliver- two black people with locs - walk up to the stage to receive the Oscar for "Hair Love" was a powerful moment. You all broughtDeAndre Arnold, and you talked about the CROWN Act in your speech. It really felt like the culmination of a moment. What kind of message do you think this sent?
Anytime you can have art meet real life action and change, with a story like DeAndre's and the story like the CROWN Act, it's just the best situation possible for a film. Our goal was to always try to help change the world, and try to have young black boys and girls see themselves in this medium of animation, which often is the first medium of film that most kids are introduced to.
When you don't see yourselves in these mediums, it really can do a number to your self-confidence. There are so many stories of young kids saying they want their hair straight like their favorite character and just things that may not seem damaging at the time. For us, we wanted a character in Zuri (the daughter in the film) who was very proud of her hair; you can tell she got it from her mom, and her dad, as well, who has locs and tattoos and looks like any young black man you would see today.
We just wanted people to see themselves in the project.

Some would say you kind of "spoke into existence" your Oscar win with some clairvoyant tweets. What was that winning moment like for you, knowing how long the journey had been of starting "Hair Love" from a Kickstarter?
Eight years ago, it was a little darker time in my career. I just did my first feature and was trying to figure out what would happen next. I didn't get the same love that a lot of other filmmakers get after their first films, so I was kind of considering giving it up. I didn't have a lot of followers on Twitter at the time, so I could just put stuff out there almost like a journal. So for it to happen - when I tell you it all felt like a dream, and still does - it hasn't really, truly hit me.
I had to go right back into work the very same day. I had to bring it with me (on the set of "Mixed-ish"); I didn't even get a chance to go home. Light flex, light flex. It was cool, though, too, because for the most part, how many times are you ever going to see an Oscar in your life? It was cool seeing the cast and crew be inspired.

You dedicated your award to Kobe Bryant. What does it mean to you to have won in the same category he did just two years ago?
Kelly Carter, an ESPN writer made the connection that he was the first former athlete and I was the second. Kobe actually retweeted it, it was one of his last tweets; he said, "Let's go." He was very supportive. I think it just goes to his mentality: He didn't see it as competition but as another young brother trying to come up and he wanted to support. I hoped he may present the category.
For me, he represents everybody who has a strong second act in their career; he always talked about wanting to be a storyteller. Even when he won his Oscar two years ago, backstage you could tell he was like a kid, he was just so honored to be there. Because there was that connection of both being a former athlete, I really wanted to honor him, and show him that obviously what he did blazed the path and now we just got to keep the ball going.

Black men and their sons have a special bond with their hair as well, so I'm curious what made you choose to focus on a father-daughter relationship in "Hair Love"?
Back in 2016, I came across a really amazing image of what looked like an Afro-Brazilian father, and his daughter was sitting in his lap and she had these two afropuffs. How they also say little girls are "daddy's little girl" and little boys are "mama's little boy," there's just something about that dynamic that is always so special. I saw that image; that's when I initially had the idea for the project, and then I tried to make it happen. A year later, for whatever reason, it fell off; then I came across all these videos of dads doing their daughters' hair. For me it was like if we can capture that same magic that is helping these videos go viral, then we'll be in good shape. I think that's what we did.

In your speech you mentioned "Hair Love" being born out of wanting to normalize black hair. Do you have anything else in the works that will continue moving that mission forward?
In all my work I always try to normalize black life. Typically it's smaller, slices-of-life stuff, stories that show us just being us and just us existing. And that act in itself is radical because so often we have the burden of our entire race when we're doing films, where we have to represent for everybody. And I think the more we just normalize each other's stories, I just think the world will be a better place.

Texto completo: Ben Affleck, Oscar-winning writer, director of the Oscar-winning "Argo," better actor than you remember - and, yes, alcoholic divorcé - has four movies coming out this year.
Dad Bod Batman has been banished, and actual films are back on his docket, including his first all-on-him movie in four years: "The Way Back," a poignant sports drama that arrives in theaters March 6. Affleck plays a reluctant high school basketball coach with big problems - he's a puffy, willful, fall-down drunk who blows up his marriage and lands in rehab.
You read that correctly.
"People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they're trying to make go away," Affleck said. "You're trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make that discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts. It becomes a vicious cycle you can't break. That's at least what happened to me.
"I drank relatively normally for a long time. What happened was that I started drinking more and more when my marriage was falling apart. This was 2015, 2016. My drinking, of course, created more marital problems."
Affleck's marriage to Jennifer Garner, with whom he has three children, ended in 2018 after a long separation. He said he still felt guilt but had moved past shame.
"The biggest regret of my life is this divorce," he said. "Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.
"It's not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures - the relapses - and beat myself up," he said. "I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you've got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward."
"The Way Back" was originally called "The Has-Been." That downer of a title was dropped during development as the film became less focused on what a basketball talent the main character had been in high school, Affleck said. Suffice it to say, no star wants to appear on a poster next to the words "The Has-Been," especially not after two box office disappointments. "Justice League" (2017) took in $658 million, a puny sum by superhero standards, and "Live by Night" (2016), a period gangster drama that he also directed, flatlined with $23 million.
Affleck, 47, has been working like a madman to get his career back on track. The hard truth is that the outcome is not guaranteed. Moviegoers, women in particular, will ultimately decide: Is forgiveness for transgressions still something that society in all of its Twitter-fied polarization allows? To some, Affleck is still the guy who broke Garner's heart and who was accused of groping a talk-show host in 2013. "I acted inappropriately," he said of that incident in 2017, as the #MeToo era dawned, "and I sincerely apologize."
Hollywood has certainly granted Affleck clemency. He just finished acting in "Deep Water," a psychological thriller co-starring Ana de Armas ("Knives Out") that's due in theaters in November. He's on Netflix this month in "The Last Thing He Wanted," an abysmally reviewed mystery anchored by Anne Hathaway and directed by Dee Rees. Affleck has also been working with the Oscar-nominated Nicole Holofcener and Matt Damon on the script for "The Last Duel," which begins filming in France this month. Set in the 14th century, "The Last Duel" re-teams Affleck and Damon as screenwriters for the first time since "Good Will Hunting" in 1997; Ridley Scott is directing.
Affleck has not talked much about his alcoholism since completing a third stint in rehab in 2018. (The first two were in 2001 and 2017.) But the arrival of "The Way Back" has made the subject impossible to avoid. Affleck has also accepted that the second word in Alcoholics Anonymous does not apply to him - certainly not after he (briefly) relapsed in the fall, turning up smashed on TMZ a few months after making it known that he had achieved one year of continuous sobriety.
"Relapse is embarrassing, obviously," he said. "I wish it didn't happen. I really wish it wasn't on the internet for my kids to see."
Growing up in Massachusetts, Affleck saw his own father drunk almost every day.
"My dad didn't really get sober until I was 19," Affleck said.
"The older I've gotten, the more I recognize that my dad did the best he could," he said. "There's a lot of alcoholism and mental illness in my family. The legacy of that is quite powerful and sometimes hard to shake."
Affleck's younger brother, Casey, 44, has spoken about his own alcoholism and sobriety. Their paternal grandmother took her own life in a motel when she was 46. An uncle killed himself with a shotgun. An aunt was a heroin addict.
"It took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic," Ben Affleck said. "The next drink will not be different."
It seemed like a good moment to point out how many stars had started to speak out about getting sober - Brad Pitt most notably - and how that was lessening the stigma of addiction and, perhaps, inspiring people with substance problems to seek help. Jamie Lee Curtis, sober for two decades, appeared on the cover of Variety's "recovery" issue in November. Discussing their sobriety in recent books and interviews have been Demi Lovato, Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Simpson, Demi Moore and, of course, Elton John, who has sponsored Eminem.
Affleck cited the sober A-listers Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr. as "guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude."
"One of the things about recovery that I think people sometimes overlook is the fact that it inculcates certain values. Be honest. Be accountable. Help other people. Apologize when you're wrong."
Let's talk about honesty for a minute. Shouldn't he have been honest from the start about the back tattoo rather than telling "Extra" it was "fake" for a movie?
"I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me," Affleck said, shifting on the sofa where he was sitting. "It felt invasive. But you're right. I could have said, 'That's none of your business.' I guess I got a kick out of messing with 'Extra.' Is your tattoo real or not real? Of course, it's real! No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it."
Affleck has a habit of putting himself in the crosshairs. He thought it was a good idea to star (with Damon) as a fallen angel in Kevin Smith's "Dogma" (1999), which Disney decided was too blasphemous for its Miramax label to release. Playing Batman as melancholy and middle-aged was certainly not the safe choice. "The Last Duel" has already provoked indignation on social media; Affleck and Damon play a knight and a squire who are forced to duel after a woman's rape accusation.
And now comes "The Way Back," a spare film with a 1970s vibe about a man imprisoned by alcoholism.
How exactly does he make these choices?
Affleck laughed. "I've never been very risk-averse - for better or worse, obviously," he said. "Regarding 'The Way Back,' the benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic."

Hungry for intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: Rather than fretting over whether straight America is ready to accept former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's happy, loving, gay marriage - as talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been doing - straight America may want to take a cue or two from same-sex marriages, which are statistically some of the happiest around.
Social scientist Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, analyzed data from several recent studies on the satisfaction and stability rates of couples in heterosexual, gay and lesbian marriages. Men married to other men reported the lowest levels of psychological distress in their marriages. Women married to men reported the highest levels of strain.
Gay and lesbian couples, Coontz found, tend to approach conflicts with more humor and affection, spend less time criticizing and lecturing each other and offer each other more praise and encouragement, compared with their heterosexual counterparts.
"As a marriage historian," Coontz told me, "it seems to me we're totally entering uncharted territory. Never before in history have we tried to do marriage in a way that is totally free from dictation by our biology - whether we can or can't have babies; whether we have to have babies - or by legal assignments that only husbands can do this and only wives can do that. It's the first time we've really tried to build marriages that were not laid out for us by law and hundreds of years of customs."
Why not build them into the happiest, healthiest unions they can be?
"Since same-sex couples can't use imputed male-female differences to sort out who does what, they rely less on stereotypes," Coontz wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. "Heterosexual parents tend to see tasks such as child care and laundry as part of a package that is handed to one partner. Same-sex couples are far more likely to each take on some traditionally 'feminine' and some 'masculine' chores."
She cited a 2015 time-use survey that found 74% of same-sex couples shared routine child care equally, compared with 38% of straight couples.
"It's not a question of good or bad, villains or victims," Coontz told me. "It's a question of whether we can look at other models and say, 'Huh. How do you do it when you don't know that women's work is this and men's work is this?' "
The University of Texas sociologist Debra Umberson co-authored one of the studies Coontz analyzed. Umberson's work focuses less on the division of housework and child care and more on emotional labor.
Women spend more time taking the emotional temperature of their partners and their marriages than men do, Umberson found, and that's true whether women are married to men or women are married to other women. Men - gay or straight - tend to do less preemptive emotional wellness check-ins with their spouses. ("How are you feeling? Do you need to talk?")
Neither style is inherently good or bad. But conflict can arise when one partner's style differs dramatically from the other partner's, and that tends to happen more, statistically speaking, in heterosexual marriages.
"It's kind of stressful to constantly be aware of someone's emotional needs and respond to them," Umberson told me. "But even if it's a little bit hard and a little bit stressful, if it's reciprocated and there's love in the relationship, then it can be a really positive thing."
But not always an easy thing.
"Because of 200 years of rigid socialization, these roles have been around long enough that we fall into habits even if we want to do things differently," Coontz said. "We have 200 years of driving our wagon down exactly the same road, and the ruts have gotten pretty deep. So it takes some effort to pull into the new lane, so to speak."
Coontz says it's valuable to keep those centuries of socialization in mind when we're interacting with the opposite sex.
"Men have been told for 200 years that the way you show love is to explain things, to protect and to provide," she said. "And women have been told to listen and check in and do all these emotional care tasks. We've been socialized to think that we're so different from one another, and it's easy to slide into defensiveness."
Same-sex couples, on the other hand, are partnerships between two people who haven't spent their entire lives being told how mysterious and unknowable (and unreasonable) their partners are.
Now that same-sex marriages have been legal across the nation for close to five years, all marriages can benefit from research that explores their ins and outs, ups and downs.
"Relationships are so variable, and you can't say one group does it all better and one group does it all worse," Coontz said. "But the more we can look at each other's styles of problem-solving and relating and mix and match - not try to imitate, just mix and match - what works for us in our individual relationships, the better off we'll be."
Love is, indeed, a many splendored thing.

Texto completo: Afghan women have been working to build peace for decades. We have spent years fighting for basic rights and, over the past year, for a seat at the table in talks between the United States and the Taliban. We are not reassured by the agreement signed Saturday by U. S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taliban’s Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, or by the process that led up to it.
This is a critical moment for our country. The window of opportunity to ensure that all Afghans are protected in the next phase of the peace talks is narrow. Despite the significant progress made in women’s political participation in Afghanistan, Afghan women still face huge obstacles in representation.
For a start, Afghan women and representatives from civil society and other minority groups should have been at the table for the U. S. -Taliban talks that led to this agreement, but we were not. History has shown us that women and minorities stand to lose the most from any deal made behind closed doors and by a room full of men.
Doublespeak puts our rights at risk
Saturday's agreement lays the groundwork for talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. We were not surprised to read recently that while Taliban leader Sirajuddin Haqqani is tired of bloodshed and war, he opposes preconditions to these talks. Instead of guaranteeing to protect the provisions in the Afghan Constitution that grant women equality, he suggested in a New York Times op-ed that this issue can be resolved through "consensus among Afghans. "
This is doublespeak for reopening negotiations on the hard-won legal rights that Afghan women have secured through years of blood, sweat and tears. We have faced unimaginable odds and made enormous sacrifices in our battle for basic rights and freedoms.
Over 100,000 Afghans have been injured or killed in the past 10 years since the United Nations began systematic documentation of civilian casualties, and there is not a single Afghan citizen whose life has not been affected by this war.
Afghan women are desperate for an end to the violence and a durable peace, but we fear that negotiators will trade away our rights for a deal. Just last week, in order to preserve its own negotiations with the Taliban, the United States signaled President Ashraf Ghani to delay his second-term inauguration, and he did.
How can we expect the Taliban and the warlords to treat us as equals when the lead negotiators have refused to give us a seat at the table? We know from previous experience that without a seated, elected, inclusive government based on the results of the elections, this peace deal will be little more than a division of power and resources among the Taliban, the warlords and the political strongmen.
A good opportunity:Don’t assume the Taliban aren’t serious about an Afghanistan peace plan. Test them.
Women and girls make up about half of the Afghan population, and 64% of the population is under the age of 25. A sustainable peace simply cannot be built without us.
On Sunday, more than 40 Afghan civil society organizations from across the country released an open letter calling for "an Afghan-owned, Afghan-led and Afghan-maintained peace. "
Preserving all rights is nonnegotiable
They have advanced proposals to address the real issues that continue to drive the conflict, like inclusive governance, restorative justice, local grievances and refugees stranded across Europe. Their demands are clear: Elected representatives must lead the negotiations, the constitution must be preserved and efforts must be made to reduce violence across the entire country.
The new U. S. - Taliban agreement and the ensuing intra-Afghan negotiations must address our rights in specific terms, not broad generalizations. Preserving the constitutional rights of women and all Afghan citizens must be a nonnegotiable demand on the agenda of every political party and group.
Editorial Board:Donald Trump and peace envoy deserve credit for Afghanistan deal, but key questions remain
Any peace deal, if it is to succeed, will have to include the protection of our human and civil rights, including freedom of speech and religion, the right to assembly, protection for our human rights defenders, and a mechanism of restorative justice for the hundreds of thousands of victims of this long war.
Afghan women are not asking anyone to grant us our rights. Our rights are clearly enshrined in our country’s constitution, our national laws, international law and sharia law. Our message to Mr. Haqqani and other Taliban negotiators is simple: Our rights are guaranteed, and we have a right to sit at any table you do.

Texto completo: The hour is getting late. On Tuesday, Democrats will be voting in 14 states to choose a presidential nominee — and if you believe the polls, we may be heading for a disaster. Not just for the party, but for the United States of America.
We simply can't afford to nominate Sen. Bernie Sanders, an arrogant, finger-pointing socialist whose call for a revolution is a $60 trillion fantasy — exactly what America doesn't need.
I’m supporting Mike Bloomberg for president, and I urge you to do the same. He, and he alone, can provide the leadership we need to bring us together and end the toxic civil war that is ripping our nation apart.
This was made abundantly clear in last Tuesday’s South Carolina debate. With only one exception, the Democratic candidates for president shouted, bullied and blustered their way through an embarrassing two hours.
12 years of experience
Mike Bloomberg — an accomplished businessman who led New York City as mayor for 12 years — was the only person on that stage who had the guts to speak the truth. The only grown-up in the room. When he was asked a question, he responded to it directly, unlike the other candidates who reverted to their original, canned talking points and said little more.
There were four people on that stage — Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — who have collectively served more than eight decades as U. S. elected officials, charting national policy. If they believed that something is wrong with America — and there’s no question that America needs tweaking to make things more equal — why didn’t they get it done? Given their failure to accomplish this, why should we trust them now — as opposed to a candidate like Mike who saw problems in New York and found ways to fix them?
He was the only candidate in last week's debate, for example, who described what it takes to revitalize floundering public school systems across the nation — and that’s because he did just that in the nation’s largest city. Mike enriched school programs that worked, got rid of ineffective teachers and funded classrooms that addressed the needs of individual students.
He was the only candidate who gave an honest, straightforward answer to a question about marijuana, pointing out scientific evidence that it can damage the development of adolescents’ brains.
Above all, he made it clear that the Democrats’ No. 1 task is to defeat the president — not destroy each other.
I cannot remember an election in my lifetime when so much was at stake. My father had a favorite saying, which I often repeat in my courtroom, when it's clear that someone is not telling the truth and trying to pull a fast one: "Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining," he'd say. Well, that's my reaction to Sanders' hollow, hectoring call for a socialist revolution that will magically make all our problems go away. It’s a joke.
Put us on the right path
You know me as a straight talker. I am no different off the bench than on — and I tell it like it is to my family, my friends, my co-workers. Amid all the toxic anger roiling our nation, Mike Bloomberg is the one man who can put us back on the right path and turn down the noise. He will restore faith in our institutions, rekindle respect for American values and recruit extraordinarily talented people to re-energize a government that has been systematically dismantled over the past three years.
True, he may not be the most practiced debater. He doesn’t make speeches for a living, unlike the political insiders running against him. But as a smart, accomplished manager, he is second to none.
The New York Times said Mike “may be remembered as one of the greatest mayors in New York history. " Bloomberg brought a city of 8 million people back from the depths of 9/11. He spurred economic growth that led to 400,000 new jobs. Under his leadership, the number of New Yorkers without health insurance fell nearly 40% from 2001 to 2013. He drove crime down to record lows, pioneered ambitious public health initiatives and helped raise air quality in New York to the highest levels in 50 years.
As a philanthropist, Mike has put his money where his mouth is — supporting courageous programs to combat gun violence, battle climate change, fund women's health initiatives, education and the arts, and increase jobs and wealth for people of color.

Democrats are overthinking the 2020 nomination race. Time to let passions rule.
Just as important, Mike has the personal funds to help us take back the White House. But before he can do this, he has got to stop Sanders in his tracks. And that's why I’m appealing for your support.
It's no wonder other candidates feel threatened by Mike. Warren has insulted Bloomberg's personal appearance. How presidential! The last time I looked, she finished fourth in the Nevada caucuses.
It's time for Democrats to wake up. I don't believe America will elect a socialist who wants to take away your health care and replace it with a $47. 5 trillion scheme that would never get through a divided Congress.
I don't believe people of goodwill who voted for the president the last time, but might choose differently this November, will support a man who doesn't understand that they, too, must be part of a winning coalition.
We’ve had enough anger and division. We're done. America needs a leader who can restore the decency that made us the envy of the world, and get things moving again. Mike Bloomberg is that man, and your votes can put him in the White House. But the hour is late. I want peace in this great nation of ours — and so should you.

Texto completo: For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Donald Trump's recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse.
For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: U.S. recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law.
"The whole narrative has changed," said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar's leadership council. "A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here."
But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements, including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones, as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian ministate, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries.
Standing by Trump's side during the recent rollout of the plan at the White House, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel's election Monday.
But if Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one.
The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel.
"It will be impossible to provide security to the residents," Gavrieli said. "It's absurd. It's another way of saying 'Get up and leave.' "
The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to "Swiss cheese."
Regardless, Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.
Signaling their serious intent, a U.S.-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time last week in the settlement of Ariel.
Yet all this appears to have had little effect on voters.
"It was clearly timed to have a political impact," Reuven Hazan, a political scientist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. "But for all of that, nothing has happened."
Pre-election opinion polls again show Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, in a virtual tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Netanyahu's right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government.
The plan may have helped distract the public from Netanyahu's legal troubles: Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open March 17.
Gantz's endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Gantz as a "Bibi from AliExpress," using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself.
To remain in power, Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself Monday.
In September, more than 58% of Yitzhar's voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of "enemies of Israel," meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries.
But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Netanyahu's pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation.
Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
"In the big picture Netanyahu did great things," said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar's council. "But we'd like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in."
Those, he said, include the recognition that "We are the landlords. It's all our land."
Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984.
Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses.
"Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy," Moshe Goldsmith said. "We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide, and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland."

House panel now focusing on interference at Justice

Texto completo: House Democrats are scrutinizing whether President Donald Trump has improperly interfered at the Justice Department for political reasons, a prominent committee chairman said Friday, requesting documents and interviews with more than a dozen U.S. attorneys related to the cases of three Trump associates and a review of the FBI's Russia inquiry.
The requests are the first major return to politically charged oversight matters by the House Judiciary Committee since it helped impeach Trump late last year. But with House leaders intent on shifting attention toward domestic policy legislation they believe will help preserve their majority in this fall's election, it was not clear how far Democrats would be willing to escalate a likely fight.
Officials were careful Friday not to characterize the requests as the beginning of a new investigation, instead framing them as routine oversight. They come as Trump has moved aggressively in the wake of his impeachment acquittal to insert himself into Justice Department business.
"These circumstances are deeply troubling," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee chairman, wrote in a letter to William Barr, the attorney general. "Although you serve at the president's pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws. In turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility."
Nadler asked for materials related to a handful of criminal cases, including the sentencing of Roger Stone, antitrust matters and a review by John Durham into the roots of Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. Democrats believe Durham's inquiry is designed to undermine Mueller's findings.
In most of the cases under scrutiny, Trump has blurred the lines that traditionally separate the White House from criminal enforcement matters, offering running commentary or outright rooting for a result on Twitter and in public comments. Documentary records and interviews with prosecutors could definitively show whether the department acted based on Trump's statements or if the White House at any point issued more direct orders in private.
In the case of Stone, the president's remarks on Twitter blasting the judge and Justice Department lawyers for recommending what he said was too harsh a sentence for his longtime friend and campaign adviser went so far that Barr delivered an extraordinary public rebuke, but only after senior department officials intervened to reverse the recommendation of career prosecutors and suggest a shorter sentence.
The attorney general said earlier this month that he would not be "bullied" into any result and warned that the president's tweets made it "impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."
Although tensions have eased somewhat in recent weeks, Barr remains in a precarious position. Trump has largely defied his request, continuing to tweet about the Stone case and forcing Barr to contemplate what it would take for him to resign. The Judiciary Committee's scrutiny could only make things more difficult for the attorney general, whose actions have drawn intense criticism inside and outside the Justice Department for politicizing the law enforcement system.
Nadler cited those tensions as he asked for the materials by mid-March so the committee could study the matter before a planned hearing with Barr on March 31.
If history is any guide, though, the exchange will not be an easy one. The department generally opposes handing over files related to ongoing matters, especially to lawmakers of another party, though it has made exceptions. And Nadler and Barr have particularly bad blood, stemming from the attorney general's handling of the special counsel's investigation.

Texto completo: Buttons, shirts and bumper stickers heralding the failed presidential ambitions of Sen. Kamala Harris are gathering dust inside a warehouse in Texas.
Among lava lamps and incense sticks, a retailer in Connecticut still offers shirts that cry "Jeb!"
And for years after Mitt Romney's 2012 quest for the White House ended, fading campaign hats and shirts resurfaced on the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
For decades, U.S. presidential campaigns have churned out enormous quantities of swag -- $5 buttons, $15 mugs, $75 guacamole bowls -- to promote candidates, fill campaign coffers and gather sophisticated data about supporters.
Less attention has been paid, however, to what happens to all those things after most of those campaigns end, sometimes abruptly.
Many campaigns do not have a plan for what they leave behind.
"You literally go from building a multimillion-dollar startup to being shut down overnight," said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 campaign, which gave many leftover shirts to volunteers. "It's a lot easier to have people help you when you win to shut down a campaign."
Surplus items often end up in storage or in the homes of staff members and volunteers. Some are given a second life with a new campaign. Most are thought to be recycled or thrown away.
"If somebody doesn't deliberately collect them or hold on to them, almost all of it disappears," said Jon Grinspan, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History who collects presidential campaign memorabilia for the museum.
The Harris campaign placed a bulk order for merchandise in the summer, said Shelby Cole, who was digital director of Harris' campaign. The plan was to distribute the items to campaign teams nationwide. But before they could, Harris, a senator from California, dropped out.
"All of our staff was pretty much caught by total surprise," Cole said. "I was just thinking, 'Oh my God, what are we going to do with all these shirts?' "
Cole said that the vendor the Harris campaign had hired, Bumperactive, offered to store the items in a warehouse and that they had been there for months. The merchandise is not marked with the year 2020, so it could in theory be used for Harris' future campaigns, Cole said.
Harris' office said there were plans to recycle the items but offered no specifics. Kyle Johnson, owner of Bumperactive, declined to comment.
At times, vendors that print shirts and other items are left with the surplus stock. The retailer in Connecticut, Old Glory, still offers items printed for Jeb Bush, John McCain and other bygone candidates.
"It's just in our warehouse, sitting on a shelf," said Austin Braumann, a district manager for Old Glory. "What ends up happening is you either leave it up online and you can sell it, or you can donate it or throw it away."
Several hundred shirts and hats promoting Romney's 2012 presidential campaign wound up in Kenya after a former county campaign director in Tennessee donated the items to a charity run by his aunt.
The former campaign official, Alexander Waters, recalled thinking after the election, "Instead of someone selling them on eBay for $5 down the road, how can we turn this boon into something that can change someone's life?"
In 2013, Waters delivered the clothes to his aunt's charity, the Orbit Village Project, which has been operating in Kenya for more than 20 years. His aunt, Cyndy Waters, said she saw people wearing Romney hats for years.
"Kenyans are very much in tune to what's going on in American elections, so they knew Romney," she said.
Jason Worrix, marketing director for My Campaign Store, a company in Louisville, Kentucky, said he advises that leftover goods be donated to local organizations. Signs can be painted over by Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, pens can go to bars and restaurants, clothing to shelters or Goodwill.
Sometimes, campaigns reuse the material, Worrix said. Small changes can turn a yard sign for a congressional campaign into a yard sign promoting a run for governor or president, he said, and if a T-shirt or mug shows only a candidate's name, it can be reused every election cycle.
"Politicians, a lot of times they're lifers," he said. "Especially for yard signs and things, we print a lot of stickers that say 'reelect,' or cover up positions and years to modify what they're running for."
But there is no consistent practice of giving to charity, as the NFL does with the premade, "winning" merchandise of teams that lose in the Super Bowl.
Some campaigns keep their stores open; sales can help pay the bills or generate income to finance a future race. Zach Graumann, campaign manager for Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who ended his long-shot bid for president last month, said Yang merchandise would remain available until whatever was left sold out.
The National Museum of American History has about 130,000 items that showcase American political history, most of which came from campaigns. Grinspan, who has been a curator at the museum for five years, said that snagging items before they got tossed could be a challenge and that "99%" of items were thrown away.
Sometimes, collecting can mean sifting through recycling bins or piles of discarded material. In most cases, volunteers and staff members willingly share campaign merchandise.
Curators gathered a few dozen posters and buttons in New Hampshire while attending political rallies and visiting campaign headquarters, said Claire Jerry, another curator at the museum.
Jerry said the museum also received older items from people who had packed them away at home and forgotten about them. The museum recently obtained a torch used in Abraham Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign that had been sitting in the attic of a small historical society in Milford, New Hampshire, Grinspan said.
"A lot of these things come from people's junk drawers," Jerry said.
Lori Ferber Collectibles in Scottsdale, Arizona, has been gathering campaign ephemera from elections, administrations, manufacturers and estate sales for over 40 years, said Steve Ferber, the company's vice president.
The company, which specializes in presidential and presidential campaign memorabilia, recently bought and sold about 160,000 Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan buttons that one manufacturer had sitting in a warehouse since the 1970s and '80s, Ferber said.

Texto completo: Author Charles Portis died recently at 86. Whether his name means anything to you is proof one way or another as to whether Portis really was America's "greatest unknown novelist," as he was so often called.
If I say Charles Portis, author of "True Grit," the needle of recognition moves. Published in 1968 and turned into two very fine movies -- one starring John Wayne, the other directed by the Coen brothers -- "True Grit" belongs on any list of great American novels.
"True Grit" is the story of genuine eccentrics, the dissolute U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (played by Wayne), obviously, but also the novel's narrator, Mattie Ross, an old woman looking back on her adventures as a 14-year-old determined to avenge the death of her father at the hands of an outlaw. They are simultaneously ridiculous and admirable, caricatures who are also somehow recognizable as real.
The result of these tensions is a deadpan humor that many critics liken to Mark Twain, but I've always looked at Portis as an American version of England's P.F. Wodehouse, a writer who knows his culture well enough to mock it in such a way as to engender genuine affection for it.
Portis was partial to con men.The avoidance of a conventional life was a sign of virtue, and Portis' own life was largely removed from wider society. Following a brief career as a successful reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, Portis retreated to his native Arkansas and started writing, publishing "Norwood" in 1966, and finishing with his fifth and final novel, "Gringos," in 1991.
Portis was press shy, despite or perhaps because of his status as a former member of the press. His last substantive interview in 2012 was not published until the occasion of his New York Times obituary following his death. The author of the obituary, Roy Reed, died in 2017. It's like something out of a Charles Portis novel.
An author's death seems to always be a great spur to their book sales, and I anticipate people will track down copies of "True Grit" for the next few weeks.While "True Grit" may be a classic American novel, I'm here to tell you that, as fine as it is, it is not even Charles Portis' best book.
For my money, the most enjoyable Portis offering is "The Dog of the South" (1979). Narrated by Ray Midge, the novel opens with some of Portis' very best deadpan:
"My wife Norma had run off with Guy Dupree and I was waiting around for the credit card billings to come in so I could see where they had gone. I was biding my time. This was October."
The remainder of the novel is a quixotic tale of Midge's pursuit of his wife through Central America, a series of adventures featuring various Portis eccentrics. There is no real plot and yet the novel is stuffed with story. You'll read it with a little, knowing smile on your face.
A Portis book is always great company, which is why I've given away at least a half- dozen copies of "The Dog of the South" over the years. I see my current copy, which I must've picked up as a replacement after the last giveaway, looks to be unread. I will be remedying this soon.
I don't traffic in superlatives like "best unknown writer" or "most underrated novelist." What I do know is that when readers encounter "True Grit" or "The Dog of the South" or "Masters of Atlantis" (1985), they are in for some time well spent.

A dahl house: Meet Mrs. Krishnan, the accidental hostess

Texto completo: In the beginning there was “Krishnan’s Dairy,” a one-man show interweaving the story of an Indian immigrant shopkeeper and his homesick wife with the romance of Shah Jahan and the beloved consort in whose memory he built the Taj Mahal.
Over two decades later, for the Hindu harvest festival of Onam, that man’s widow of 23 years finds herself rustling up dhal (which starts with rice and lentils) for 100 or so unexpected visitors in the storage room of the convenience store (that would be the “dairy”) she took over when her husband was killed by an intruder.
Welcome to “Mrs. Krishnan’s Party,” the latest production of Indian Ink, at a guess the liveliest theater company in Auckland, New Zealand, coming Friday to the stage of the Castle Theater at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center for one night only. And Mrs. Krishnan’s guests, which is to say the public, will be right on stage with her, and not just to watch.
“Tonight we are all one people — Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, atheist, agnostic, capitalist, communist — all one tribe, united in this time and space, which, in Eastern philosophy, is possibly an illusion,” announces the 20-something emcee James, who is also Mrs. K’s lodger.
“What is real is what we feel. Who’s been to Onam before? Not many of you, eh? Sweet. Well, it’s like Christmas and Easter and Diwali all rolled into one.”
Be advised there will be dancing, and we of the Valley Isle will be falling down on the job if we don’t raise the roof at least a little.
In short, this is immersive theater, the genre that can paralyze introverts and set extroverts on fire. Whether we choose places of honor at the top table, seats in the bleachers with the self-selected wallflowers, or no chairs at all as free-ranging “party animals,” we’re part of the show.
“Dhoti kurta” or sari optional but definitely a plus. Choose locations advisedly. In the center of things you might be asked your name or get handed a can opener. Prepare to shed a tear or two when Mrs. K starts slicing onions.
Over the past two decades and counting, Indian Ink co-founders Jacob Rajan and Justin Lewis have created a repertory of nine hit plays (sample titles: “The Dentist’s Chair,” “Guru of Chai” and “Kiss the Fish”). What drives their work is the philosophy of the “serious laugh” — “opening mouths with laughter,” as they have put it, “in order to slip something serious in along with a love of mask and story.”
There seem to have been lots of masks in “Krishnan’s Dairy,” though there are none in the current sequel. Still, the laughter and the seriousness are here, in the personal histories of lead characters who misjudge what they mean to each other, what they mean to other people, where they belong and what’s in it for them if they bury illusions that have been turning to ashes in their mouths.
On the evidence of the script and video clips, Rajan and Lewis deliver wisdom of the ages (or common sense?) with a zany touch that is both fresh and graceful. So do the stars of “Mrs. Krishnan’s Party,” both in the springtime of their careers. Kalyani Nagarajan (cross yet giving as Mrs. K) and Justin Rogers (keyed up as James) were classmates in drama school and have the chemistry to show for it. That Nagarajan is way underage for her part seems hardly to matter.
As in “Krishnan’s Dairy,” the here and now of the action mirrors the long ago and faraway. In the earlier case the point of reference was historical; in this case it’s myth. James, floundering in college but going places as “DJ Jimmy J,” welcomes the crowd in a budget-busting saffron vest, emerald Aladdin pants and the gilt-flowered crown of King Maveli, an upstart demon who challenged the almighty Vishnu and lost, yet paradoxically won a kind of victory for humankind, too.
Never got the memo? Never fear. In good time, Mrs. Krishnan explains everything. Mind you, she has her reservations about James as a Malveli in sunglasses — a detail James has copied from the Maveli he locked eyes with celebrating Onam on a visit to Kerala, the faraway homeland Mrs. K still dreams of going back to.
“He was like the King of Love,” James explains, jazzed by the memory of that Flower Power moment.
“He’s supposed to be returning from the underworld,” scoffs Mrs. K. “Not Hawaii.”
Is that a serious laugh? Maybe not, but you can bet your sweet okole, on Maui that’s a zinger that lands.

------------ SPOTLIGHT
‘OUT OF ORDER’
Yet again, it’s time for top Maui thespians to brush up their Shakespeare — or at least on their King’s or Queen’s English. Hard on the heels of local productions of the recent U.K.-themed Broadway hits “Matilda” and “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” here comes a vintage slice of British politics in the form of Ray Cooney’s knockabout “Out of Order,” originally produced as “Whose Wife Is It Anyway?” in 1990. The acidulous Dale Button stars as Richard Willey, sleazeball extraordinaire, who sits at the right hand of Margaret Thatcher. Hopelessly entangled in illicit interoffice hanky-panky, he digs his grave deeper with every harebrained attempt to cover up. Don’t you love farce? Cooney supplies the multiple doors, closet and surly hotel staff. For good measure he throws in a casement window that keeps dropping like the blade of the guillotine in the Terror. Watch for Alan Muniz in the bravura role of The Body. Bring Kleenex and laugh till you cry. David Belew directs. — “Out of Order” opens Friday at ProArts Playhouse, 1280 S. Kihei Road, with shows at 7:30 p.m. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays and 3 p.m. Sundays through March 22. Tickets: $ 27; 463-6550 or proartsmaui.com.
‘THE GREAT AMERICAN SONGBOOK’
A big role for Capathia Jenkins on Broadway was the Washing Machine in “Caroline, or Change,” a slab of laundry room magic realism from the baroque imagination of Tony Kushner as in “Angels in America” (music by Jeannine Tesori). As a concert artist, Jenkins has more glamorous opportunities. Stepping onstage for her Maui Pops debut, she won a standing ovation for presence alone. Already she’s back for a return engagement, exploring “The Great American Songbook” with Tony DeSare (vocals and piano). With Gershwin, Kern, Berlin and Rodgers on the playlist, it’s the sort of Champagne program you might have swooned over back in the day at one of Manhattan’s swankiest cabarets. If you missed Jenkins last time, don’t make that mistake again. — Maui Pops:“The Great American Songbook,” Capathia Jenkins, Tony DeSare, 3 p.m. March 8 at Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater. Tickets: $ 22- $ 60, 242-7469 or mauiarts.com.

Texto completo: Monday's 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America's real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors and enabling President Donald Trump to claim that "our economy is the best it has ever been." Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what's happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market," says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. "But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What really matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education."
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 per hour, picking up trash from sports fans who may pay hundreds of dollars to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single mothers in the United States, 29% live in poverty. Most do not have college educations and could not afford one even if they wanted a four-year degree.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with ever higher deductibles and co-pays.
Workers have strikes against them Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, today's stock market decline does mean a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce, not counted in official unemployment statistics. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can't afford to rent a small apartment.
The Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on the Chinese economy — and potential impact on the global economy — are cited as the major reasons for Monday's stock market sell-off. However, it is poor, low-wage and even many middle-class Americans who are more likely to be in poor health and have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those who have higher incomes and are well educated. The richest American men live 15 years longer than the poorest.
A huge collapse in the stock market makes little difference to them. How could it, if one is behind on one's bills, has a broken-down car, needs food stamps to eat and Medicaid to get health care.
Conversely, a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones is not going to stop the wealthiest Americans from buying homes around the world and a yacht or private jet where they can drink Dom Perignon. As inequality has grown, the top one-fifth of earners account for about 55% on the nation's annual income. By comparison, the bottom 20% account for just 4% of all income.
Since investments in equities represent wealth, the wealth comparisons are even more glaring. The top 1% hold nearly 40% of the country's wealth, significantly more than the middle 60% of the income distribution. If those at the top bewail the millions in stock-market investments wiped out Monday, remember: 2 out of 5 households do not have enough savings to make ends meet for three months at the poverty level if they had no income.
Let's make the distinction: Today was an awful day for investors, but too many Americans don't have the savings to participate in the stock market at all. For them, today's trillion dollar economic calamity means little.

Texto completo: It was late on a Friday afternoon in November when representatives of Mike Bloomberg arrived at the Alabama Democratic Party headquarters in Montgomery to qualify the former New York City mayor's presidential primary run.
The entry, just under the state's filing deadline, was a late one, trailing behind Democratic candidates who had been on the campaign trail for months.
But Bloomberg – and his unparalleled campaign coffers – have made up for lost time in the state.
"I don't think Donald Trump should be president of the United States," Bloomberg said in a campaign stop in downtown Montgomery in December. "... I don't think he is the right person for the job. I think he's done enormous damage to this country, both domestically and in terms of our relationships around the world. I'm spending an enormous amount of money to try and replace him."
And spend he has. The Democratic candidate has amassed a whopping 30-person staff across four field offices in the state, a presidential campaign staff likely larger than any other in state history. It's an unprecedented level of investment in a ground campaign, political experts and former campaigns staff say, particularly in a state not typically prioritized by Democratic candidates. The staff size dwarfs the rest of the field's, where some candidates, such as Pete Buttigieg, have zero paid staffers in the state.
"The Bloomberg strategy in Alabama and elsewhere has been shock and awe," Democratic pollster Zac McCrary said. "Every time you turn on your television you see an ad. Every time you fire up your computer, you see a Bloomberg ad. I can't think of a primary campaign in Alabama history that has rivaled this in terms of boots on the ground, money sunk in the ground. And that's not unique to Alabama."
The New York Times in early February called the campaign a "waterfall of cash," citing monthly paychecks equivalent to annual salaries of $72,000 for "entry level field organizing work," $12,000 monthly for communications directors and state political directors, and $10,000 monthly for state communications directors.
Analysis of advertising buys by FiveThirtyEight estimates that of $5.54 million in TV advertising in Alabama, Bloomberg's purchases account for $5.09 million.
Bloomberg's investments have certainly garnered some results: The campaign nabbed a coveted Alabama Democratic Conference endorsement in January from the minority-led wing of the state party, a historically key player in the Democratic bedrock of black voters in the state.
Bloomberg courted ADC chairman Joe Reed on a December visit to Montgomery, where he was feted around the city by Reed's son, newly elected Mayor Steven Reed, on a private visit to the EJI memorial and a roundtable on maternal mortality. Later flanked by the younger Reed on a podium in downtown Montgomery, Bloomberg announced his own plan to address maternal health, a critical issue in Alabama and one that particularly affects black women around the country.
At the podium, Bloomberg mentioned the elder Reed, calling him the "top Democrat in this state," an interesting distinction as many of the state's leading elected Democrats back former Vice President Joe Biden.
The distinction mirrors the ongoing chasm in the Alabama Democratic Party, whose former leadership, heavily backed by Joe Reed, was deposed last year by Rep. Chris England, a leading minority member in the Alabama statehouse. England was supported by U.S. Sen. Doug Jones in the contested takeover. A Reed-backed lawsuit challenging England's leadership was dismissed recently in local court.
"The quality that makes Joe stand out is his ability to bring people together to find common ground while standing up for what he believes is right," Jones said in a statement last year endorsing Biden. "We need to listen to each other and get things done for working people. Joe can, and will, do that."
Despite joining Bloomberg onstage in December, Mayor Reed has not yet officially endorsed a candidate.
Natalie Davis, professor emerita at Birmingham Southern University, said she expects to see a split between the two candidates.
"I think there will be a split in the vote because Biden is a known entity," said Natalie Davis, Professor Emerita at Birmingham Southern University. "You may have the young-old splits we've seen across the country."
Though Bernie Sanders surged in Nevada, Alabama has polled as one of his weakest states. McCrary said it doesn't appear Sanders has been able to "crack the code" and connect with large African-American voting blocs, which make up the majority of Alabama Democratic voters.
McCrary disclosed his firm, ALG Research, is working with the Biden campaign, but he is not personally engaged with the account. Ten days ago, McCrary said there was an "open question" of whether Biden was ready to get knocked out. But the former vice president has strengthened his hold in South Carolina, a very similar state to Alabama in terms of racial and socioeconomic demographics.
Despite Bloomberg's campaign investment and the ADC endorsement, Alabama may be Biden's state to lose, McCrary said.
"The ADC historically packs a punch, the endorsement," McCrary said. "But in my experience the ADC endorsement is more valuable in lower profile races where they don't know as much about the candidates. I think any endorsement, including ADC's, is less impactful when voters are familiar with these candidates. I think it packs less of a punch in a high-profile race, than in a sleepy, down ballot affair where voters haven't been paying much attention and use ADC as a tiebreaker. You don't have to look to far back to the 2008 primary when ADC endorsed Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama won Alabama with large majorities."
Davis said Bloomberg's blanketing strategy certainly "puts him in the game."
"I'm guessing Dr. Reed's influence is still there," Davis said. "But for people who are following the race, I suspect Joe Biden will get the lion's share. You don't know what information is floating out there as well. We don't know how many people are going to vote."
Though Alabama, one of the most reliably Republican states in the country, is not typically the highest priority on the Democratic campaign trail, candidates are expected to converge in Selma on Sunday to commemorate the annual Bridge Crossing Jubilee.
Biden, endorsed by Selma native and Democratic U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, is slated to speak at the historic Brown Chapel Sunday service.

Texto completo: "Hamilton" is coming back.
Don't race for the Aronoff Center box office just yet. "Hamilton" doesn't open until March 2, 2021. But if you want a guarantee that you'll get seats for Lin-Manuel Miranda's blockbuster musical, you'll have to subscribe to Broadway in Cincinnati's 2020-2021 season, which was announced Thursday evening.
There will be other ways to get tickets. There's a daily lottery for $10 seats. But that's still a long shot. Single tickets won't go on sale for several months. But since the show will be here for four weeks – a week longer than last time – it means there will be an additional 21,000 tickets in play.
In the meantime, the only sure thing is to subscribe. And frankly, you could do worse. The season that was announced Thursday night is a very solid one.
There are even a couple of shows that are still playing on Broadway; "Frozen" – yes, that "Frozen" – and "Ain't Too Proud," a highly touted bio-musical about The Temptations. There are golden oldies, too, like "My Fair Lady."
No, we didn't get "Hadestown" or "The Prom." But we did get Aaron Sorkin's new take on "To Kill A Mockingbird" and "The Band's Visit," which is very likely to be the sleeper hit of the season. And if history has taught us anything, those other shows will make their way to Cincinnati before long.
"We've been so fortunate that we've had such an awesome menu of productions to choose from in recent years," says Genevieve Holt, general manager of Broadway in Cincinnati." And it's true that recent seasons have had very few shows that would qualify as clunkers. This has been a strong decade or so for Broadway and Cincinnati has continued to reap the benefit of that.
Subscriptions range from $245 to $830 and go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday. Single tickets will be available at a later date. For information, call 800-294-1816, go to BroadwayinCincinnati.com or drop by the Aronoff Center box office, 650 Walnut St., Downtown.
Here is the season that was announced Thursday evening. All performances are in the Aronoff Center's Procter & Gamble Hall.
'Pretty Woman: The Musical,' Nov. 10-22 Based on the wildly popular 1990 movie about the bad-girl-gone-good starring Julia Roberts. Much of Garry Marshall's original screenplay is still there, supplemented by a musical score by Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. "It's a Beverly Hills fairytale with an early '90s aesthetic," says Holt.
'My Fair Lady,' Dec. 1-13 Lincoln Center Theater director Bartlett Sher has a way of taking classic musicals and breathing new and contemporary life into them. We saw it when his production of "The King and I" came to the Aronoff in 2018. He did it again with "My Fair Lady," for which he won a Tony Award for best director.
'Frozen,' Jan. 6-24, 2021 Yes, this is Disney's much-loved musical about Elsa and Anna and a dazzling world of ice. "Let It Go" is there, too, along with "Fixer Upper" and "For the First Time in Forever," as well as a slew of new songs created by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez.
'The Band's Visit,' Feb. 9-14, 2021 This is the quirkiest show on the series. It may also turn out to be the show that theater lovers talk about the longest. It won 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Based on a 2007 Israeli film, it tells the unlikely tale of Egyptian ceremonial band – all policemen – who inadvertently find themselves stranded in a remote town in the Israeli desert. In its rave review of the show, The New York Times said it was "one of the most ravishing musicals you will ever be seduced by."
'Hamilton,' March 2-28, 2021 American history you can share with your kids. You've heard it all before; a dazzling, hip-hop-infused retelling of a part of American history you probably long ago forgot.
'To Kill a Mockingbird,' April 6-18, 2021 Writer-producer Aaron Sorkin is best known for TV shows like "The West Wing," "Sports Night" and "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip." But he's a playwright, too. A really good one. Before his inventive take on Harper Lee's novel opened on Broadway, purists were outraged. But the resulting play – this one – won over many of those skeptics. It is still running on Broadway.
'Hairspray,' May 4-9, 2021 Saucy. Cheeky. Outrageous. Use whichever word you want to describe the musical based on John Waters' 1988 movie. The enthusiasm of Tracy Turnblad, the high schooler at the center of the story, is irrepressible. Never mind that she is called "overweight" – and many crueler things. Never mind that she is reprimanded for her "inappropriate hair height." This is 1962 Baltimore and Tracy is determined to change her little slice of the world.
'Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,' May 25-June 6, 2021 Don't write this off as just another jukebox musical. Besides having fabulous music and choreography, this show also spins the true story about a group of young men who parlay their talent and perseverance into global stardom. Thanks to a script by "Genius Award" winner Dominique Morisseau, it's as much a tale about friendship and social justice as it is a show about beloved hit songs.
Caroline Bowman as Elsa, along with several other members of the cast of the North American Tour of "Frozen," The show will run for three weeks, Jan. 6-24, 2021, as part of the Broadway in Cincinnati subscription season.

It's normal for counting votes to go slowly on election nights

Texto completo: The contrast between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary offers two lessons for the media and the public, especially for the next two contests in Nevada and South Carolina: Put your trust in professional election administrators, and don't expect an immediate announcement of the winner.
The Iowa Democratic Party, not election professionals, ran the caucuses. The party made mistakes at several turns. It transmitted and tabulated results using a new app that turned out to be unreliable. It then compounded those errors by rushing to report results, which appeared incomplete and potentially inaccurate, over the ensuing days.
By contrast, New Hampshire election officials administered the primary. They did it without any hiccups and, importantly, there seemed to be less of a rush to announce the winner.
The Nevada Democratic Party is running Saturday's caucuses, while state election officials are in charge of the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29. Nevada Democrats are trying to learn from the experience of their Iowa counterparts, but the bottom line is unavoidable: The practice of nonprofessionals administering caucuses adds another reason to question the entire caucus system, which is generally undemocratic and unrepresentative to begin with.
Slow results are not 'rigged' results The other problem is our impatience to know the outcome. Regardless of who is running an election, the news media and the public should let the process play out without demanding immediate results. Spending several days to determine an election winner is a feature, not a bug, of election administration. We must all temper our expectations on election night.
The danger here is that media frenzies over late or even less than immediate results can undermine public faith in our elections. In Iowa, just as the caucuses ended, journalists and political pundits were spreading wild speculation that something was "amiss" just because the state party had not released results quickly enough. President Donald Trump's campaign then picked up on that rampant speculation, with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeting, "Quality control = rigged?"
No. Quality control means that the state Democratic Party did not want to release results that were inaccurate or numbers they would have to amend in the days that followed. How much worse would it be to release initial results that then changed or that they could not verify as abundantly accurate?
We actually know how bad that can be. The Iowa Democratic Party initially released partial numbers the day after the caucuses, with additional results trickling out later that week. A New York Times analysis has revealed that those vote totals had internal inconsistencies. Candidates were justifiably upset.
It is quite likely that some of these mistakes — especially manual tabulation errors — were due to the zeal to release results. Humans are fallible, and even more so when we rush. The state party was under immense pressure, just minutes after the caucuses ended, to tell us who won.
It was the perfect storm: The party was rolling out a new system in which it reported three sets of results, using a new, untested app to tabulate the numbers from caucus sites, and all in an environment where everyone was clamoring for an immediate announcement of the winner.
Reasonable delays are normal Of course, delays should not take forever. We don't need to emulate Afghanistan, which just named the winner of a bitterly disputed presidential election that took place five months ago. But a reasonable delay in vote totals should become the norm in America. We should let election administrators — especially those like in Iowa and Nevada who do not do this for a living — take their time to go through the ballots and confirm their accuracy.
Let's remember election night 2018, when some pundits did not wait for West Coast results before deeming Democrats' hoped-for blue wave a bust. Eventually, but not immediately, results from California and other states made the wave a reality. But the normal delay in processing ballots still opened the door for Republicans to speculate about irregularities and plant doubts about the count.
Now imagine election night 2020. It takes time to tabulate results, especially in states with a lot of mail-in ballots. We might not know the winner right away. But if the public and the news media demand immediate vote totals, and if election officials rush in an effort to cede to those demands, then we could be in for a terrible scenario: uncertainty about who actually won the presidential election amid wild allegations of something amiss.
Let's instead take a deep breath and let the process work itself out slowly. Delays should not undermine the public's faith in our election system. Campaigns should not use this media narrative to plant unfounded ideas of electoral shenanigans. Election officials should not rush their processes due to media pressure.
All of this is dangerous for its potential to diminish confidence in our democratic process.
Instead, we should give those who run our elections time to do their jobs and produce accurate results. American democracy won't break down if we have to wait a few hours or days to find out the winner of the Nevada caucuses or South Carolina primary.

Texto completo: Based on the tone of Tuesday's Democratic debate, you would think the Kremlin has already determined the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Russians are "engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our election." Billionaire Tom Steyer said there is "an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now." Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg charged that Russia was backing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to ensure a Trump victory in November.
Clearly, the Russia scaremongering is in full swing. Last week's intelligence community testimony that the Kremlin is backing President Donald Trump made headline news. Another report emerged alleging Moscow is backing Sanders. Biden claimed that Bernie-backing Russian bots have been attacking him on Facebook. And Hillary Clinton told a foreign audience that "Russians are back in our cyber systems," and that "anyone who tries to deny it" is living in a "sad dreamworld."
Russia seeks chaos Moscow no doubt is up to something, seeking to create chaos and discredit democracy. So are other malign actors. But it is safe to say the greatest practical effect Russia will have is serving as a narrative platform for Americans to generate increasingly strident headlines, tweets and sound bites discrediting the election. This will happen whether Russian President Vladimir Putin lifts a finger or not. As the Democratic debate showed, it is happening already.
First, let's acknowledge that Moscow's attempts to undermine American democracy did not start in 2016, or even back in the 1980s when Sanders was there on his honeymoon. Interference in foreign politics has been a fixture of the Kremlin's foreign strategy for 100 years, since the days of the Comintern. These efforts have had no discernible impact on American politics, other than occasionally to provide talking points for left-wing radicals.
There is no reason to suspect Russia will improve its record in shaping American elections. The Mueller report detailed the efforts of Kremlin-linked activists to interfere in the 2016 election, but it did not conclude that these crude propaganda efforts influenced the outcome whatsoever. We should balance our legitimate concern that the Russians are trying to sway the electorate with the knowledge that they are not very good at it.
On the other hand, technology has made these influence operations easier to execute. Social media networks have empowered superficial and emotional messaging regardless of the source. And Americans hardly need Moscow to push divisive ideas. Any glance at Twitter reveals how bitter our politics has become, whether traffic is driven organically by memelords or paid for by Bloomberg.
But the Russian interference narrative has become entrenched. When intelligence community election expert Shelby Pierson speculated to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting that Russia was trying to help President Trump get reelected, it quickly leaked, became a front-page story in The New York Times and precipitated the usual outrage. It took a few days for the less dramatic truth to catch up — that there was no evidence for the "misleading" supposition that the Kremlin is pro-Trump; at best Russia may have a "preference" for a "deal-maker."
However, it is not clear how Russia would benefit from a Trump second term, since the first one has not worked out well for them. President Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, expelled Russian diplomats, sent arms to Ukraine, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, undercut Russia's natural gas markets in Europe, pursued strategic nuclear modernization while not rushing to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and even killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria.
Those who recklessly accuse the president of being a Kremlin asset should seriously rethink their premises.
Moscow isn't always to blame It is also a mistake only to blame Russia for bot campaigns and other forms of election interference, since any foreign government with a grudge against the United States could be at it. Iran has already tried to hack into the Trump reelection campaign. China may also be involved in seeking to influence the 2020 election; it was recently accused of election meddling in Cambodia and Indonesia.
When incidents take place leaving behind clear evidence of well-known Russian cyberespionage groups like Fancy Bear, it could well be hackers from other countries trying to cover their tracks. Even Americans could be exploiting the climate of Russophobia to try to hack the election and escape undetected.
The United States should remain aware that malign groups, both foreign and domestic, will seek to exploit the increasingly shrill information domain to tilt the election playing field one way or the other. Forewarned is forearmed. Even so, Americans should not make it easy for them. We play into the hands of these groups by overreacting to the latest shiny stimulus thrown into the media ecosystem. In that sense, the real problem is much bigger than the Russians; the problem is us.

Texto completo: It's good to be the king.
That Mel Brooks line from a movie in which he played a lascivious Louis XVI is a classic.
Who doesn't sometimes envy the perks Louis had?
Until he lost his head, of course. It's much better these days to be one of the CEOs of a major corporation. Louis had to worry about the guillotine. They don't even have to worry about going to jail.
Last year, the CEOs of the corporations included in the S&P 500 were paid an average of 287 times as much as their median employees. Sure, that's a lot, say their apologists, but they deserve this kind of compensation because they are critical to everything that happens in the huge businesses they run.
Well, not everything. If the corporation gets involved in something illegal, you can bet we'll be told the CEO had no idea what was going on.
Delawareans know a lot about this because we are home to the Wilmington Trust. It was one of the few banks that had top executives found guilty of crimes during the financial crisis. Four of its executives have been sentenced to prison sentences and are out on bail during appeal. But CEO Ted Cecala was not even indicted for any of the crimes. Federal prosecutors decided to "focus on the easier cases his subordinates presented," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
That's pretty typical.
There is a plethora of cases in recent years documenting questionable activity by major corporations, with little of the blame placed on CEOs. In my opinion, in most of these cases you have to believe in the tooth fairy to say they didn't know what was going on.
Examples? How about Volkswagen secretly attaching equipment to their diesel cars to fool the EPA into believing their emissions were legal. Or Wells Fargo adding accounts to thousands of customers without their knowledge or approval.
Or opioid manufacturers who told doctors opioids were not addictive long after they knew they were. Or dozens of Wall Street Banks that sold mortgage backed securities to their customers long after they knew they were in deep trouble. I've always been bothered — no, actually incensed — by cases like these. But I was reminded of them in the past few days by what we have learned about the Boeing Corp.
Investigators in the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max airliners in 2018 had concluded some time ago that they were caused by malfunctioning in the plane's maneuvering characteristics augmentation system.
Boeing recently had to turn over to the FAA documents relating to the 737 Max's development. The documents support the allegation that Boeing engaged in a major conspiracy to convince airlines that if they purchased the plane, they would not require the expensive and time-consuming additional training for pilots who had been qualified for the older 737 models.
As the New York Times reported, "Boeing employees mocked federal rules, talked about deceiving regulators and joked about potential flaws in the 737 Max as it was being developed, according to over a hundred pages of internal messages delivered to congressional investigators."
In a letter to Boeing employees interim CEO Greg Smith said, "These documents do not represent the best of Boeing."
"They joked about potential flaws." And 346 people died. I'd say you put it rather mildly, Mr. Smith.
But who was responsible? It is obvious to me it was the man who led Boeing during the 737 Max debacle, former long-time CEO Dennis A. Muilenburg. But the Boeing board must have disagreed. They awarded him a golden parachute between $26 and $58 million.
I'm not accusing Muilenburg of being responsible for the deaths of the passengers on the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline flights. I am accusing him of fostering the corporate culture that led to those tragedies.
The 737 Max was Boeing's biggest money maker. The message to Boeing employees — do everything possible to avoid bottlenecks that would impede sales of the plane — had to come from the top.
There is a well-known saying in some corporate circles: "If the boss wants peanuts, feed him peanuts." Corporate boards are not doing their jobs, and neither are prosecutors who take the easy way out and target lower-level executives instead of CEOs.
If you get paid an enormous salary because you are responsible for everything, you should be held responsible when your organization is caught doing something wrong.

Intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: YITZHAR, West Bank - For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Donald Trump's recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse.
For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: U.S. recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law.
"The whole narrative has changed," said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar's leadership council. "A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here."
But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements, including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones, as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian ministate, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries.
Standing by Trump's side during the recent rollout of the plan at the White House, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel's election Monday.
But if Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one.
The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel.
"It will be impossible to provide security to the residents," Gavrieli said. "It's absurd. It's another way of saying 'Get up and leave.' "
The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to "Swiss cheese."
Regardless, Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.
Signaling their serious intent, a U.S.-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time last week in the settlement of Ariel.
Yet all this appears to have had little effect on voters.
"It was clearly timed to have a political impact," Reuven Hazan, a political scientist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. "But for all of that, nothing has happened."
Pre-election opinion polls again show Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, in a virtual tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Netanyahu's right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government.
The plan may have helped distract the public from Netanyahu's legal troubles: Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open March 17.
Gantz's endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Gantz as a "Bibi from AliExpress," using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself.
To remain in power, Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself Monday.
In September, more than 58% of Yitzhar's voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of "enemies of Israel," meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries.
But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Netanyahu's pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation.
Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
"In the big picture Netanyahu did great things," said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar's council. "But we'd like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in."
Those, he said, include the recognition that "We are the landlords. It's all our land."
Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984.
Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses.
"Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy," Moshe Goldsmith said. "We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide, and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland."

Texto completo: YITZHAR, West Bank - For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Donald Trump's recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse.
For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: U.S. recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law.
"The whole narrative has changed," said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar's leadership council. "A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here."
But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements, including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones, as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian ministate, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries.
Standing by Trump's side during the recent rollout of the plan at the White House, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel's election Monday.
But if Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one.
The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel.
"It will be impossible to provide security to the residents," Gavrieli said. "It's absurd. It's another way of saying 'Get up and leave.' "
The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to "Swiss cheese."
Regardless, Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.
Signaling their serious intent, a U.S.-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time last week in the settlement of Ariel.
Yet all this appears to have had little effect on voters.
"It was clearly timed to have a political impact," Reuven Hazan, a political scientist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. "But for all of that, nothing has happened."
Pre-election opinion polls again show Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, in a virtual tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Netanyahu's right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government.
The plan may have helped distract the public from Netanyahu's legal troubles: Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open March 17.
Gantz's endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Gantz as a "Bibi from AliExpress," using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself.
To remain in power, Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself Monday.
In September, more than 58% of Yitzhar's voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of "enemies of Israel," meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries.
But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Netanyahu's pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation.
Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
"In the big picture Netanyahu did great things," said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar's council. "But we'd like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in."
Those, he said, include the recognition that "We are the landlords. It's all our land."
Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984.
Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses.
"Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy," Moshe Goldsmith said. "We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide, and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland."

No guns for known abusers

Texto completo: The federal Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, first passed in 1994, bans people from owning or buying guns if they were convicted of felony domestic violence or subject to a domestic violence-related protection order. But that doesn't apply if the abuse happened in a dating relationship.
Roseanna Otto was 23 and had been separated from her boyfriend five years when she was shot to death last May 27 in her Winterset home — as their two daughters slept in the next room. Otto's ex-boyfriend, Jerome Moyer III, has been charged with breaking into her house and murdering her with a single gunshot to the head. According to a police report, he told a sibling after Otto was shot that he had killed her and planned to kill himself.
Moyer is scheduled to stand trial in June. He's also in line to serve a 15-year-sentence that previously was suspended for breaking into the house of another ex-girlfriend in 2015 and putting a knife to her throat. In 2014 he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic abuse against Otto and received a deferred judgment.
How could he have a gun after those convictions?
Because of gaps in the law. The federal Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, first passed in 1994, bans people from owning or buying guns if they were convicted of felony domestic violence or subject to a domestic violence-related protection order. But that doesn't apply if the abuse happened in a dating relationship (i.e. the couple wasn't married or divorced), if the protective order was temporary, or if the offenses were misdemeanors.
Otto's sister, Lilly Steil, believes she would still be alive if those omissions had been fixed in the law, which has been up for re-authorization since last year. The U.S. House last year, on a bipartisan vote, passed a bill to reauthorize and extend the gun bans to people convicted of misdemeanor stalking or domestic abuse, or subject to temporary restraining orders, and those in dating relationships. But after the National Rifle Association opposed the firearms ban being extended to dating partners, the Republican-controlled Senate refused to put California's Sen. Dianne Feinstein's companion bill, S. 2843, to a vote.
Feinstein had worked on it in the Judiciary Committee with Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa. But Iowa's first female senator later withdrew her support and introduced a version without the expanded gun restrictions.
Now Steil has teamed up with Be A Hero Fund, founded by health care activist Ady Barkan. It has launched a campaign called "Why, Joni?" urging the senator to change her stance. Steil recently delivered to Ernst's Des Moines office 45,000 letters representing the number of people nationally who have signed a petition calling on Ernst to close the so-called Boyfriend Loophole.
Noting that Ernst is herself a survivor of domestic and sexual assault, Steil asks, "Why is she not putting victims over the NRA?"
One possible reason: Ernst has been identified as the seventh-highest recipient of NRA political action committee funds. In 2017, the New York Times, using data from the Center for Responsive Politics, said she had received a cumulative $3.12 million from the organization.
Ernst spokesman Brendan Conley didn't answer a question on that. But he wrote in an email, "As you may know, Senator Ernst is a survivor herself and this is an issue that is personal for her." He said Ernst had worked closely with Feinstein, whom she called "a tremendous partner," on a re-authorization (Ernst's version). But he said Democrats "walked away from the table."
Iowa's other senator, Republican Chuck Grassley, who's also on the Judiciary Committee, hasn't taken a position on either VAWA bill, according to his spokesperson, Taylor Foy, noting neither has come before the committee this year. But he said Grassley supports funding increases for various VAWA programs as proposed in Ernst's bill.
In a Register op-ed last November, the executive director of the Adel-based Crisis Intervention & Advocacy Center thanked Ernst for her advocacy on sexual violence. But Johna Sullivan called her bill "a non-starter," for excluding the additional gun restrictions, among other things.
Grassley bristles at any criticism of Ernst, saying in a statement forwarded by Foy, "As someone who has lived through a sexual assault, Senator Ernst has shown real bravery and leadership to fight for other survivors by championing legislation to extend the Violence Against Women Act. It's outrageous that anyone would insinuate that she doesn't have survivors' best interests at heart."
No one is accusing Ernst of that. Victim advocates are looking to her to use her unique position to push meaningful legislation keeping guns out of the hands of known abusers.
In Iowa, there have been 60 incidents of domestic abuse involving guns since 2014, according to a Progress Iowa 2018 report. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence says the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide five-fold.
This isn't an ideological or partisan issue. It's about whether the gun lobby should be able to call the shots on legislation to save women's (most victims are women) lives.
Conley says Ernst remains committed to working with Feinstein on a solution. But that can't happen if Ernst is unwilling to disarm abusers. She, of all people, knows why that's necessary. In divorce papers filed against her former husband, Gail, she alleged he had abused her physically and mentally. Gail Ernst even revealed his attitude in a Facebook post while they were married. It said, "What do you do if you see your ex running around in your front yard screaming and bloody? Stay calm. Reload. And try again."
No advocate could have made a better case for why abusers shouldn't have guns.

Texto completo: We're often told to follow the rules, do what we're told, and for goodness sake, don't make waves. But in today's hyper-competitive economy, isn't that a surefire path to mediocrity?
Look at those we celebrate — from Thomas Edison to Elon Musk, from Sheryl Sandberg to Tony Robbins. The ones who make history have one thing in common: They're not afraid to get a little crazy.
The breakaway musical success of Billie Eilish is a recent example. Her style and singing are instantly recognizable and deeply distinctive. She sets the trend instead of following it. Her talent is incredible, to be sure, but what makes her irresistible is her unique and creative approach. In contrast, many wildly talented vocalists who blend in and play other people's music currently perform in wedding bands instead of massive arenas.
Shouldn't not being crazy enough be the real fear? We may think we're playing it safe but run the significant risk of painful regret. Nearly every interview of people at the end stages of life reveals a deep longing for the risks they never took, the shots the never attempted. We're not on this planet to follow other people's rules, rather to share our creative voice with others and leave a legacy of progress.
Personally, I don't think the goal should be to live our entire lives without ever visiting the penalty box.
The hallmark of those who achieve greatly and leave the biggest mark on the world is a willingness to balk at conventional wisdom, defy traditions, and yes ... get a little crazy at times. It's those oddball ideas that drive progress and fuel meaningful change.
Inside you right now is an unorthodox idea that can unlock amazing results. In fact, you probably have a baker's dozen. So, why let the restrictive voice of others confine your creative genius from shining through? If you allow your wonky ideas to surface, you may just uncover fresh possibilities. You'll at least be glad that you refused to have your creative voice silenced by the trembling masses.
In the words of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, "Those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music." But those who dance are the ones who are remembered; they're the ones who make history.
So, give yourself permission to get a little crazy this week. Realize that your nontraditional ideas may, in fact, be your best. It's time to let your hair down and let your creativity shine. It's time to dance like nobody's watching.

Texto completo: Good morning.
I hope you're enjoying your coffee.
Oh, also, you're probably going to get the coronavirus.
That's not my take. It's the title of a recent piece in The Atlantic: "You're Likely to Get the Coronavirus."
If you're scared, you're not alone. Global fears may have already chipped away at your net worth. The Dow posted the biggest one-day point drop in history Thursday and continued to plunge Friday.
If you were planning on retiring in 10 years, maybe now think 11.
Of greater concern, the coronavirus has killed around 3,000 people worldwide. That's obviously serious. But let's put it in perspective. The flu killed 10 times more people last year in the U.S. alone.
Still, this virus is nasty, fast-spreading, and scientists don't yet have a vaccine. So we have worldwide alarm.
In Orlando, at least one planned conference with 3,000 people has been canceled, according to CNBC. And Disney has already temporarily shuttered its parks in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo.
But there are no travel bans in America yet. And the number of suspected cases here is limited. So before everyone completely freaks out, I thought I'd gather some basic information.
My first tip for avoiding coronavirus is not to go to China or South Korea. If neither was on your to-do list, you're in good shape.
My next tip is not to touch the snot or spit of anyone else who has the coronavirus.
Again, definitely not something I planned on doing - which is good because the Centers for Disease Control says the coronavirus is spread "via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes ... that can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs."
I'm not sure I've ever read a more disgusting sentence.
After I was done gagging, I consulted a health expert.
Dr. Timothy Hendrix, medical director of AdventHealth's Centra Care operation, is not freaking out. He has a face mask at home, but uses it only for yard work.
"There are a lot of unknowns about this virus," he said. "But right now, we can't give in to fear."
I was starting to feel relief when Dr. Hendrix compared the coronavirus to hurricane season in Florida, saying: "Right now, it feels like that hurricane's pointing at us."
Oh great. A virus-cane. I might prefer a sharknado.
Yes, the virus is still spreading. But Hendrix stressed the vast majority of people who contract it will have either very mild symptoms or be completely asymptomatic.
(See what happens after I spend a half-hour with a medical professional? I start using words like "asymptomatic.")
Still, the mortality rate for the coronavirus (technically known as COVID-19) is around 2%, much higher than the flu. So people are on high alert.
Some of those people are politicians, which can be a problem since politicians rarely make problems better.
Democrats are blaming President Trump for not getting a better handle on the virus. Trump is blaming Democrats for instilling fear. And Marco Rubio posted a Twitter video where he implored everyone to stop politicizing everything ... and then blamed Democrats.
Meanwhile, American businesses, especially tourism-related ones, are struggling to ease fears.
Headlines like this one from the New York Times don't help: "Coronavirus Is Spreading. Should You Cancel Your Family Vacation?"
Like most headlines that end in question marks, the article that followed didn't really answer the question it posed. Instead, it quoted experts who said travelers should feel "very comfortable" coming to Florida theme parks, while also warning travelers "that could quickly change" and that you could reduce risks by "reducing travel."
So, don't cancel your plans ... though maybe think about it.
When the Orlando Sentinel sought comment from Disney for a story last week, the park declined, probably not wanting the words "Disney" and "coronavirus" to appear together in yet another news story. (Sorry.)
Still, if you doubt America's ability to contain this virus, don't doubt the desire.
The president's re-election banks strongly on an economy that isn't tanking while face-mask sales soar. And though Florida's political leaders often act like they don't care much about public health, they darn sure care about hotel-occupancy rates. So this virus should get top priority.
The CDC lists a high "alert" for travel to China and South Korea and medium alert for Japan, Italy and Iran.
The CDC offered no warnings about the Magic Kingdom or Universal Studios.
Instead, Hendrix said the best thing to do is live responsibly. Wash your hands. Use hand sanitizer. Disinfect dirty surfaces.
That last one is something I've practiced obsessively ever since the day I saw a man at the gym blow his nose into his exercise towel - and then use that towel to wipe down his elliptical machine.
I worked out my abs that day by retching.
Some people are just gross. So to avoid their germs - as well as those belonging to anyone who might have the flu, coronavirus or any other nasty bug - stay vigilant.
The best thing Hendrix says we can do is avoid germs and pay close attention to the news and health alerts in case things change.
But generally: Live your life. There's no reason to cancel a weekend trip to Vegas or Sunday afternoon at Epcot. Said Hendrix: "Enjoy life."
And if that virus-cane does actually hit, we'll let you know.

Beware rush to shrink jail population

Texto completo: In step with a growing number of states, Michigan last year established a task force to offer recommendations to reduce levels of incarceration. This month the 21-member task force (which includes three of my judicial colleagues) recommended that our Legislature undertake a wide-range of fundamental changes of the state's criminal justice system, largely focused upon reducing numbers of incarcerated persons. The task force views its report as establishing a "legacy of a justice system that other states will look to as a national model."
Several of the task force's proposals — for example, those promoting discussion concerning appropriate classifications and sanctions for particular criminal offenses — strike me as useful. Others are more troubling — for example, making offenders as old as 25 eligible for diversion to youth programs; eliminating mandatory incarceration for "3rd or subsequent" impaired driving offenders; authorizing police to issue 'broken taillight'-like citations for "all misdemeanors," including aggravated assault, resisting arrest, larceny, retail fraud, intentional firearm discharge, negligent homicide by vehicle, trespassing, prostitution, disorderly conduct, reckless driving, and first/second time impaired driving; and eliminating or drastically reducing sanctions for failing to show up in court at appointed times.
Faulty premises? The rationale for a task force committed to "deincarceration" is explained in the following way: "[t]he number of people in our county jails has nearly tripled in the last 35 years, yet crime has fallen steadily for decades to the lowest rate in 50 years." This reminds me of a late 1990s New York Times headline: "Crime Keeps on Falling, But Prisons Keep on Filling." There is no recognition in either of these assertions that diminishing levels of crime may be attributable to a considerable extent to "the number of people in our county jails."
The task force report's authors also assert that "defendants sentenced to jail are more likely to commit future crimes than those assigned to probation," suggesting that incarceration accounts for higher levels of criminality. They neglect to consider that prior judicial assessments of criminality and dangerousness to the community might explain why courts had previously incarcerated certain persons rather than giving them probation.
Victims of crime are largely an after-thought in the report, mentioned dutifully but passingly, and characterized as stakeholders to be awarded a position of representation on the task force and afforded a range of "supportive" public services. Notably, however, there is no recognition of the substantially larger number of Michigan residents who may have avoided becoming victims of crime precisely because the present justice system had either incarcerated offenders or effectively deterred potential ones.
Costs and benefits While the task force speaks much about the financial burdens of incarceration, there is no sense of priority concerning which public expenditures are most necessary for a healthy, prosperous and free society, nor any recognition that for most citizens, protection from criminal perpetrators is the first responsibility of state and local government.
The first civil right of the citizen is the right to be free from criminal aggressors. In determining proper levels of "deincarceration," lawmakers must be focused in a gimlet-eyed manner upon what best maintains and preserves an effective system of criminal justice. The task force laments these costs without reflecting upon the far more substantial, and often tragic, costs of an excessive or a poorly-crafted "deincarceration."
It is no great accomplishment to reduce numbers of incarcerated persons; the doors can be opened wide tomorrow. The real challenge, never straightforwardly confronted in the report, is how to achieve the proposed reductions in a way that does not compromise the safety or security of the community.
There is not a paragraph in the report that reflects upon how its recommendations might affect the historical and traditional purposes served by criminal punishment. To what extent, for example, will reduced levels of incarceration diminish the deterrent effect of our criminal laws? To what extent will the people's sense of what constitutes fair and proportionate punishment, and justice under law, be eroded?
Is it conceivable that the relationship between levels of incarceration and levels of crime is exactly the opposite of what the task force surmises? What understandings of the human condition persuaded all past generations of Michiganders to suppose that incarceration possessed considerable virtue in protecting their communities from higher levels of crime?
What 'constitutional mandates'? The report references a litany of "constitutional" concerns with current pretrial detention policies and practices, as well as a "recent wave of litigation across the country . . . ordering thousands of people released from jail." Michigan, thus, must "better align [its] practices with . . . constitutional mandates."
However, there is not the scantiest evidence laid out that Michigan's practices in the realm of bail or pretrial detention are in breach of the Constitution. All that is clear is that some members of the task force would prefer different public policies, or else realign the Constitution with their own values.
While the report invokes countless social sciences and criminological studies and statistical data in support of its recommendations, it never quite explains why matters of crime and punishment are better decided by academicians and non-profit organizations than by "we the people" acting through their elected representatives.
This lack of explanation is perhaps a function of the significant number of counter-intuitive, and highly-debatable, results produced by many of these studies upon which the report relies — for example, "research shows that even short periods of incarceration can increase future criminal behavior." Is government by experts really more certain to "offer prudent guidance about what does and does not work" than the judgments and experiences of ordinary citizens and their elected representatives?
Amidst the report's myriad statistical analyses and data, it is ironic that there is one glaringly-absent figure: an estimate of the sheer number of persons to be deincarcerated, or deincarcerated earlier, as a result of the adoption of the report's recommendations. Even an approximate figure would assist the public and its legislators in realistically assessing the costs, benefits, and likely social impact of deincarceration.
Experts vs. experience The 'broken windows' theory of law enforcement asserts that the toleration of even lesser forms of criminal conduct nurtures a social environment in which more serious crimes are likely to take root. The task force report is akin to an "anti-broken windows" approach to law enforcement, asserting that "removing low-level violations from arrest eligibility would preserve law enforcement time and resources, limit the costly use of jail for minor infractions, and reduce the number of people with criminal records."
The task force, however, might wish more clearly to explain to the citizenry in places such as Detroit, Flint, and Saginaw why supposed "evidenced-based" theories of academicians are to be preferred to "experience-based" theories, such as that of 'broken windows' policing, that have proved successful in large urban areas?
Finally, the report is grounded upon the erroneous premise that our current justice system is hell-bent upon confining and incarcerating. But this gives little recognition to the broad range of existing alternatives to incarceration: drug courts and other 'problem-solving' courts; juvenile justice alternatives; parole, probation and pretrial release; and a wide array of federal and state constitutional protections. Each of these is intended (in a more cautious and less-encompassing fashion than the recommendations of the task force) to employ incarceration as a 'last-and-not-a-first' option and to focus incarceration upon those who pose the most substantial risks of harm to other persons.
Rather than "reimagining our criminal justice system," as urged by one task force leader, or viewing "incarceration always [to be] a policy failure," as claimed by another, state policy-makers must not lose sight that their first obligation is to ensure a fair, responsible, and effective criminal justice system, without which no community or neighborhood can prosper. If the task force's proposals are adopted, its legacy will be either the improving, or the deteriorating, crime statistics of the next decade.

Rather than "reimagining our criminal justice system," state policy-makers must not lose sight that their first obligation is to ensure a fair, responsible, and effective criminal justice system, without which no community or neighborhood can prosper, writes the guest columnist.

A look at county's caucus results

Texto completo: Coverage of Bernie Sanders' commanding victory in Nevada's caucus has rightfully focused on the Vermont senator's exhaustive outreach to union workers and Latino communities in Southern Nevada — home to more than three-quarters of the state's registered Democrats.
But a Reno Gazette Journal analysis of precinct voting data shows Northern Nevada, and particularly Washoe County, played a typically understated role in last week's closely watched presidential nominating contest.
Here are four big takeaways from caucus results tallied in Nevada's second largest county:
Bernie's blowout The numbers behind Sanders' victory are stark.
The 78-year-old self-described Democratic Socialist won 10 of 16 Nevada counties, including both major population centers in Las Vegas and Reno.
Entrance polls show he prevailed statewide with white voters, Latino voters and voters under the age of 65. He also led the field among self-identified liberals and moderates, as well as voters whose most important issues were health care, climate change and income inequality.
In fact, Sanders topped his fellow presidential contenders in 24 of 26 major demographic groups tracked by the Washington Post, shoring up support from almost every major cross-section of the electorate except black voters and those over the age of 65, both of whom preferred former Vice President Joe Biden.
The story was much the same in Washoe, where Sanders won an eye-popping 65 percent of active polling places, beating Biden in all but a handful of voting locations largely concentrated in Sparks and Northwest Reno.
Those margins suggest Washoe — which went for Sanders in 2016 and progressive gubernatorial hopeful Chris Giunchigliani in 2018 — will remain a reliable fount of support for future left-wing office-seekers.
Biden's loss, Buttigieg's gain No one seems to have learned that lesson harder than Biden.
The 77-year-old ex-senator from Delaware led most Nevada polls until just 10 days before the caucus, and was able to leverage respectable support in Clark County into a second-place finish in the state.
Yet he fared far worse in Washoe, landing in fifth place behind Sanders, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.
Voting data from the Nevada State Democratic Party shows Biden performed well in moderate- and minority-heavy areas, as well as a handful of more rural precincts such as Pleasant Valley.
He might have done even better in less-populated areas if not for Buttigieg, who made a point of reaching out to rural voters in Pahrump, Fallon and Elko — the same type of places where he outperformed expectations in Iowa.
That gambit paid off, handing Buttigieg a win in four rural counties, and a strong runner-up spot in Washoe that went a long way toward limiting Biden's share of the Silver State's electoral spoils.
If Buttigieg had not run up the score in those Northern Nevada voting districts, he might have walked away without a single state delegate to the party's national convention in July.
Moderates still seeking a standard bearer Buttigieg was far from Biden's only problem north of Las Vegas.
Washoe's precinct vote tallies show the former senator from Delaware also stumbled during the final alignment — caucus-speak for a second round of voting when supporters of less-popular candidates are encouraged to join up with groups of caucusgoers who backed a better-liked contender.
Biden shed 34 percent of his Washoe supporters on the second ballot, a sign that he simply wasn't able to convince caucusgoers that he was the best in a big batch of fellow moderate contenders to take on President Donald Trump.
The good news, at least for Biden, is that no one else could either.
Klobuchar and California billionaire Tom Steyer hemorrhaged first ballot voters in Reno's affluent suburbs and several delegate-rich downtown precincts.
Warren, the progressive firebrand and senator from Massachusetts, was one of the prime beneficiaries, adding supporters in more than 40 percent of precincts where Klobuchar, Steyer and others lost footing. This is why Warren ended up with more delegates than Klobuchar and Biden, despite falling behind the pair in the initial headcounts conducted at many precincts.
Sanders, too, benefited from the fractured field of moderate contenders. He gained ground in 60 percent of Washoe precincts while losing voters in only 14 percent of polling places, adding to his reputation as a formidable caucus opponent will an near-unshakable base of fervent backers.
Nevada's last Democratic caucus? Nevada Democrats have been widely praised for successfully overhauling the state's entire caucus process in a last-minute bid to avoid embarrassing vote-tallying delays.
That isn't to say last week's caucus was error-free. Or even that it's likely to stick around.
The RGJ's analysis of Washoe precinct data found votes reported from at least one polling place that did not appear to have any eligible Democratic voters. In another instance, officials recorded eight votes at a location that was only supposed to have three eligible caucusgoers.
The New York Times and others have highlighted similar mistakes in the final results, albeit none that would've affected the final outcome.
Still, within hours of the polls closing, a host of top Nevada Democrats — among them former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Gov. Steve Sisolak and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto — eagerly joined the push to do away with the caucus system in favor of a more traditional primary election.
They say the switch will make voting easier and more accessible, all while reducing the time needed to publish results.
The move would also make nominating contests more expensive, and would require approval from the same Nevada Legislature that's balked at previous efforts to abandon the caucus.
For now, Nevadans can take comfort in the fact that their votes had a big impact on this presidential primary, and likely many more to come.

Texto completo: As the broad and largely cash-strapped field of Democratic presidential hopefuls fights through the slog of early primary states, Mike Bloomberg has been spending big in Pennsylvania.
The former New York City mayor's campaign has spent more than $16 million in television and radio ads blanketing state airwaves. He's got offices at both ends of the state and a highly paid staff of 70, including organizers in the Lehigh Valley. Among his top advisers? Former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, who is serving as his national political chairman.
That Pennsylvania presence is continuing to grow: Bloomberg's campaign team opened four offices in the Philadelphia suburbs Feb. 22 with others - including one in Allentown - expected in the coming weeks.
It's an expensive investment that Pennsylvania rarely sees from presidential campaigns at this point in the election calendar, nearly two months before the state's April 28 primary. The multibillionaire doesn't have to worry about cash flow. But he also may need to tap those funds to explain parts of his background that raise eyebrows in a Democratic primary - such as the $6 million he spent in 2016 on ads supporting Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey.
So far, his polls have been mixed: A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Bloomberg doing as well or better than his primary rivals among Pennsylvania voters in a hypothetical matchup against President Donald Trump, with Bloomberg up 48% to 42%. A Morning Call/Muhlenberg College poll published Thursday had Bloomberg trailing Trump, 45% to 48%, within the margin of error.
"He's capable of reaching lots of individuals with his ads," said Chris Borick, a political scientist and pollster at Muhlenberg College, adding that Bloomberg's efforts in the state are "a sign that he, along with others, thinks Pennsylvania will actually matter, that it will be an extended primary."
Bloomberg's campaign says the early focus on Pennsylvania is part of a broader national strategy to build an operation in key general election states while other Democratic contenders focused their resources on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Pennsylvania is "incredibly important," said Rosie Lapowsky, Bloomberg's spokeswoman in the state. "We came here to set up infrastructure and get boots on the ground."
In the Lehigh Valley, local Democrats say several presidential campaigns, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, also have had an organizing presence, but Bloomberg has deployed the most resources in terms of staffing and salaries. (The level of investment has made some Democrats concerned down-ballot candidates with fewer resources will have trouble staffing their campaigns.)
Kathy Harrington, first vice chair of the Lehigh County Democratic Committee, said she was surprised by the show of force locally, and when Bloomberg outpaced others in petition signatures.
Harrington, who says she'll support whoever ends up as the eventual Democratic nominee, has seen Valley Democrats shifting in their preferred candidate. There was early support for Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a slow build around Klobuchar and a recent boom for Bloomberg, she said.
"It's shaping up now where, right this minute, it's Sanders versus Bloomberg," Harrington said of the current prevailing preferences.
Cheryl Johnson-Watts, an Allentown School Board director and former mayoral candidate, leads Bloomberg's organizing in the Valley. A native New Yorker, Johnson-Watts said she's been a longtime fan of Bloomberg, recalling being impressed with how he treated employees during his tenure as mayor.
"When I heard he entered the race, I immediately filled out an application," Johnson-Watts said.
Some of Bloomberg's opponents, principally Warren, have criticized Bloomberg for allegedly making derogatory comments about women and for asking female employees to sign nondisclosure agreements. Bloomberg said Tuesday that he had complied and released some female employees from the agreements.
At a campaign event in Allentown focused on affordable housing issues, Johnston-Watts blended a pitch on Bloomberg's housing proposals into a larger discussion on local housing challenges. (The event's host was Allentown developer and former Republican mayoral candidate Nat Hyman, also a Bloomberg supporter.)
Those listening were largely invited by Johnson-Watts and still making up their minds on a candidate. Bruce Davis, a Bethlehem resident who said he's become politically active since Trump's election, said he sees Bloomberg as a self-made man with appeal to both sides of the political aisle.
Plus, Davis said, "He's the only one that has the money to put up a fight against this guy," referring to Trump.
That event came hours after Bloomberg took a pummeling from rivals during his first appearance at a Democratic presidential debate. Among the attacks on Bloomberg was a jab over Bloomberg's past financial support for Republican political candidates.
That attack resurfaced during Tuesday's debate in Charleston, South Carolina. Warren criticized the money that Bloomberg's Independence USA political action committee spent to help reelect Toomey, who she decried as "an anti-choice, right-wing Republican senator."
Bloomberg's group supported Toomey because the Republican senator co-sponsored a bill to expand background checks on gun sales. That support and endorsement may have proved critical in a close race, frustrating some state Democrats.
"I don't care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has. The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him," Warren said Tuesday night.
Bloomberg responded by characterizing the attacks on his past support of Republicans as "sideshows" and highlighting the support he received as mayor.
"When people hired me to run New York City three times, in an overwhelmingly Democratic, progressive city, they elected me again and again," Bloomberg said.
Johnson-Watts says Bloomberg's rationale on supporting Toomey makes sense, describing it as "a strategic move" focused on the gun control issue, not Toomey's broader policy positions.
It's an issue that's likely to arise again as the Pennsylvania primary approaches. But for now, Harrington said she hasn't heard many voters mentioning it. So far, she said, they just want to know if he can take on Trump.

Texto completo: YITZHAR, West Bank - For the residents of the hilltop Jewish settlement of Yitzhar, President Donald Trump's recently published plan for Middle East peace comes with a blessing and a curse.
For many, it fulfills a lifelong dream: U.S. recognition of the biblical promise and legitimacy of the settlements in the occupied West Bank, allowing Israel to annex them while flouting decades of international consensus that they violate international law.
"The whole narrative has changed," said Matanya Gavrieli, 27, a member of Yitzhar's leadership council. "A president of the United States came along and said the people of Israel have the right to be here."
But what many of the settlers object to is that the plan leaves Yitzhar and 14 other isolated settlements, including some of the most ideologically hard-line ones, as enclaves surrounded by a Palestinian ministate, tethered to Israel by narrow arteries.
Standing by Trump's side during the recent rollout of the plan at the White House, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel proudly announced that he would annex the settlements and that not a single settler would have to be uprooted, a pitch that was expected to increase his chances in Israel's election Monday.
But if Netanyahu hoped this plum from Washington would win Likud the crucial votes it needs to ensure a right-wing victory after two inconclusive elections in April and September, they were unlikely to come from settler strongholds like this one.
The idea of a Palestinian state surrounding Israeli settlements was dangerous, Gavrieli said, however far-off that state may be. The Palestinians have rejected the plan, which is seen as heavily weighted toward Israel.
"It will be impossible to provide security to the residents," Gavrieli said. "It's absurd. It's another way of saying 'Get up and leave.' "
The Palestinians were not happy with the Trump map either.
President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority compared its proposed Palestinian state to "Swiss cheese."
Regardless, Netanyahu has campaigned hard to convince his base that only a right-wing government led by his conservative Likud party can capitalize on the plan by moving quickly and unilaterally to extend Israeli sovereignty to the settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.
Signaling their serious intent, a U.S.-Israeli team charged with the preparatory work of mapping the exact areas to be annexed convened for the first time last week in the settlement of Ariel.
Yet all this appears to have had little effect on voters.
"It was clearly timed to have a political impact," Reuven Hazan, a political scientist and professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said of the Trump plan. "But for all of that, nothing has happened."
Pre-election opinion polls again show Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving prime minister, in a virtual tie with his main rival, Benny Gantz, of the centrist Blue and White party. Neither Netanyahu's right-wing religious alliance nor the center-left bloc appears to have a clear path to forming a majority government.
The plan may have helped distract the public from Netanyahu's legal troubles: Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases, his trial is set to open March 17.
Gantz's endorsement of the plan, at least as a basis for negotiations, made it less partisan but also blurred the lines between his party and Likud. Netanyahu has mockingly referred to Gantz as a "Bibi from AliExpress," using his own nickname to denigrate his rival as a cheap imitation of himself.
To remain in power, Netanyahu needs Likud to be the largest party and for the right wing-religious bloc to beat the center-left bloc. In the last two elections, however, the pro-settlement parties squandered votes because of internal squabbling and political fragmentation, a result that could easily repeat itself Monday.
In September, more than 58% of Yitzhar's voters cast their ballots for Jewish Strength, a tiny extreme right-wing party that advocates Jewish sovereignty over the entire West Bank and other occupied territories and the transfer of "enemies of Israel," meaning Palestinians, to neighboring Arab countries.
But the party failed to win enough support to enter Parliament, and the more than 80,000 votes it garnered went to waste. The party has insisted on running again, despite Netanyahu's pleas for it to drop out of the race and channel its voters to him or allied right-wing parties large enough to be assured of representation.
Yitzhar, southwest of the Palestinian city of Nablus, is home to the Od Yosef Chai seminary, whose students have a reputation for violence against Palestinian villages and for clashing with Israeli security forces who try to curtail their activities. Some Yitzhar voters are now deliberating between the pro-settlement Yamina party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism.
"In the big picture Netanyahu did great things," said Yechiel Klein, 37, another member of Yitzhar's council. "But we'd like to see a stronger stand on the things we believe in."
Those, he said, include the recognition that "We are the landlords. It's all our land."
Itamar, another would-be settlement enclave southeast of Nablus, has had its share of bloodshed. Its vulnerability was exposed in 2011 when two Palestinian teenagers from a nearby village slipped into a home and stabbed five members of the Fogel family to death in their beds, including a 3-month-old baby. At least 20 residents have been killed in attacks since the settlement was established in 1984.
Moshe and Leah Goldsmith, both 56 and Yamina voters, were among the first families to move in. Born and raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, their living room window looks out onto Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, the mountains framing Nablus where, according to the Bible, the Israelites delivered blessings and curses.
"Any plan with a mention of a Palestinian state is a tragedy," Moshe Goldsmith said. "We want peace, but we are not willing to commit suicide, and we will never agree to something like that, giving up our homeland."

Texto completo: At 33, Jahleel Weaver has pretty much won the celebrity-stylist lottery.
As deputy creative director of Fenty, the women's ready-to-wear and accessories line introduced by Rihanna in May, his days are spent working alongside a nine-time Grammy Award winner whose clothing brand is backed by LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, and released to her passionate fans without regard to conventional seasonal rhythms.
Theirs is a close relationship. "We talk almost every day," Weaver said. "I feel I'm her little brother," although Rihanna is younger, at 31.
"Creatively, he is my right hand," she wrote of Weaver in an email, "but at the same time, it's as if we're family."
The path that led Weaver to help guide the most talked-about fashion debut of 2019, founded by one of the most influential women in popular culture, was a long and gently winding one.
At 18, he moved from suburban Maryland to New York to study fashion design at LIM College. Weaver helped support himself by working in sales at Jeffrey, the high-end retailer in the meatpacking district known for its extensive shoe department and attentive customer service.
He quickly met some famous clients, many downtowners working in music, and began to style several. "To be working for, and building a brand," Weaver said, "I always think about my experience at Jeffrey."
Weaver was also making inroads working as a freelance stylist away from the store, and it was on one of these gigs that he met Mel Ottenberg, who is currently the creative director of Interview magazine. Ottenberg had just begun collaborating with Rihanna on her 2011 "Loud" tour and brought Weaver on to assist him.
Soon enough, Weaver and Rihanna became inseparable, traveling the globe together. (Ottenberg continues to style Rihanna on occasion, as he did in 2018, dressing her when she was a host of the Met Gala in a dazzling jewel-embroidered, papal-inspired Margiela ensemble.)
When Rihanna decided in 2014 to start the umbrella company Fenty Corp., giving it her last name, she asked Weaver to join as a junior creative director.
He was there to help her create the beauty line Fenty Beauty, which soon had legacy cosmetics brands scurrying to broaden the colors of foundation on offer; Savage x Fenty, a line of inclusive, body-positive-inspired lingerie, the show of which had fashion week attendees squealing in September; and Cameo, her everything-old-is-new-again jewelry line.
"The most valuable thing Jahleel brings to the process," Rihanna said, "is his complete understanding of my vision."
Virgil Abloh, the founder of the cult streetwear-inspired fashion line Off-White and the artistic director for menswear at Louis Vuitton (also part of LVMH), said the creative dynamic between Rihanna and Weaver has resulted in "looks that are cemented within popular culture." (Fuzzy slides were just the beginning.)
Abloh first came to know Weaver through what he refers to as an "international tribe of creatives," a community of designers and artists constantly on the move.
Weaver, although he continues to travel extensively, now lives primarily in Paris. He moved there in early 2018 to begin work on Fenty's debut, a fairly stressful undertaking.
"How do you put everything that Rihanna represents into one collection?" Weaver said.
The answer came to the pair late one night in the form of a music metaphor: an album and its release. Rather than settle on distinct, themed collections shown twice a year, Fenty would drop capsule collections throughout the year, much as singles are released over the course of an album's rollout.
This would heighten anticipation and set the brand apart from the grind of the fashion pack.
"Each release," Weaver said, "can speak to something different," with inspiration taken from various aspects of Rihanna's personal style, be it sleek futurism or the history of Cameo.
"At the end, you have a full album, a full body of work," Weaver said. "I think that's the beauty about our release schedule - there's a piece of Fenty for everything you might need to get dressed."
Basing Fenty's strategy around online drops was a radical move, jolting the old seasonal schedule with the hectic cadence of fast fashion.
But Fenty has been even more cutting edge in giving people of color a place at the top of an industry still plagued by racial inequality and insensitivity.
When Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH announced Fenty, Rihanna became the first woman and person of color to establish a house with the luxury retail giant. At a time when high-profile brands continue to be plagued by racist missteps - just this year Gucci was forced to recall a balaclava knit-top that resembled blackface - the significance of Fenty's debut was not lost on Weaver.
"All the barriers that were broken in that one day, with that one announcement," he said, "I actually cried."
Along with Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Olivier Rousteing running Balmain, Rihanna's entry into the field was further evidence to many that change, however overdue, is finally coming to the upper echelons of luxury fashion.
Weaver is feeling optimistic. "Because of people like Ri constantly breaking barriers," he said, "it makes it a lot easier to exist in space where representation for people of color didn't necessarily exist."
And his own place in that space?
"Honestly," Weaver said, "I think I'm still pinching myself."

Texto completo: The juiciest parts of the new book "Dark Towers: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump, and an Epic Trail of Destruction" pick up where the last scandal involving the bank left off - manipulating interest rates amid the 2008 financial crisis. This isn't just an exposé of a massive global bank. It's also the tragic story of a senior Deutsche executive, Bill Broeksmit, who served as the conscience of the bank over many years. In January 2014, he died by suicide.
In the aftermath, the author, David Enrich, worked with Broeksmit's son, Val, to understand why his father did what he did. Val discovered that his father's personal email accounts were chock full of official Deutsche Bank documents.
What's left to be said about a bank that has admitted to enabling the Nazi regime, and participated in the Libor interest rate scandal? Plenty.
In 2014, Deutsche Bank's Broeksmit was found dead in his London apartment. He had helped build the 150-year-old financial institution into a colossus, and his sudden death was a mystery compounded by the bank's efforts to squelch any investigation.
In "Dark Towers," published on Feb. 18 and recently excerpted in The New York Times Magazine, Enrich - finance editor of The Times - reveals Deutsche Bank's epic rise from a provincial German bank to a global superpower, and its fall into financial ruin and scandal.
Initially, the book traces the bank's history financing the construction of Auschwitz, and wooing Eastern Bloc dictators during Soviet times. He then writes about how in the 1990s, under a succession of hard-charging executives, Deutsche made a fateful decision to leave behind its conservative German roots and pursue Wall Street profits. In short order, Deutsche's leaders took the bank public, manipulated markets, violated international sanctions to aid terrorist regimes, scammed investors, evaded regulators, and laundered money for Russian oligarchs.
Keen for an American foothold, Deutsche also started doing business with a self-promoting real estate magnate whom nearly every other bank deemed too risky to finance: Donald Trump. Over the next two decades, Deutsche loaned billions of dollars to Trump, the Kushner family, and an array of scandal-tarred clients, including convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. If you're looking for a jaw-dropping financial thriller, look no further than "Dark Towers," particularly as Trump fights subpoenas on Deutsche Bank releasing his taxes and other financial records.

Texto completo: Rather than fretting over whether straight America is ready to accept former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's happy, loving, gay marriage - as talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been doing - straight America may want to take a cue or two from same-sex marriages, which are statistically some of the happiest around.
Social scientist Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, analyzed data from several recent studies on the satisfaction and stability rates of couples in heterosexual, gay and lesbian marriages. Men married to other men reported the lowest levels of psychological distress in their marriages. Women married to men reported the highest levels of strain.
Gay and lesbian couples, Coontz found, tend to approach conflicts with more humor and affection, spend less time criticizing and lecturing each other and offer each other more praise and encouragement, compared with their heterosexual counterparts.
"As a marriage historian," Coontz told me, "it seems to me we're totally entering uncharted territory. Never before in history have we tried to do marriage in a way that is totally free from dictation by our biology - whether we can or can't have babies; whether we have to have babies - or by legal assignments that only husbands can do this and only wives can do that. It's the first time we've really tried to build marriages that were not laid out for us by law and hundreds of years of customs."
Why not build them into the happiest, healthiest unions they can be?
"Since same-sex couples can't use imputed male-female differences to sort out who does what, they rely less on stereotypes," Coontz wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. "Heterosexual parents tend to see tasks such as child care and laundry as part of a package that is handed to one partner. Same-sex couples are far more likely to each take on some traditionally 'feminine' and some 'masculine' chores."
She cited a 2015 time-use survey that found 74% of same-sex couples shared routine child care equally, compared with 38% of straight couples.
"It's not a question of good or bad, villains or victims," Coontz told me. "It's a question of whether we can look at other models and say, 'Huh. How do you do it when you don't know that women's work is this and men's work is this?' "
The University of Texas sociologist Debra Umberson co-authored one of the studies Coontz analyzed. Umberson's work focuses less on the division of housework and child care and more on emotional labor.
Women spend more time taking the emotional temperature of their partners and their marriages than men do, Umberson found, and that's true whether women are married to men or women are married to other women. Men - gay or straight - tend to do less preemptive emotional wellness check-ins with their spouses. ("How are you feeling? Do you need to talk?")
Neither style is inherently good or bad. But conflict can arise when one partner's style differs dramatically from the other partner's, and that tends to happen more, statistically speaking, in heterosexual marriages.
"It's kind of stressful to constantly be aware of someone's emotional needs and respond to them," Umberson told me. "But even if it's a little bit hard and a little bit stressful, if it's reciprocated and there's love in the relationship, then it can be a really positive thing."
But not always an easy thing.
"Because of 200 years of rigid socialization, these roles have been around long enough that we fall into habits even if we want to do things differently," Coontz said. "We have 200 years of driving our wagon down exactly the same road, and the ruts have gotten pretty deep. So it takes some effort to pull into the new lane, so to speak."
Coontz says it's valuable to keep those centuries of socialization in mind when we're interacting with the opposite sex.
"Men have been told for 200 years that the way you show love is to explain things, to protect and to provide," she said. "And women have been told to listen and check in and do all these emotional care tasks. We've been socialized to think that we're so different from one another, and it's easy to slide into defensiveness."
Same-sex couples, on the other hand, are partnerships between two people who haven't spent their entire lives being told how mysterious and unknowable (and unreasonable) their partners are.
Now that same-sex marriages have been legal across the nation for close to five years, all marriages can benefit from research that explores their ins and outs, ups and downs.
"Relationships are so variable, and you can't say one group does it all better and one group does it all worse," Coontz said. "But the more we can look at each other's styles of problem-solving and relating and mix and match - not try to imitate, just mix and match - what works for us in our individual relationships, the better off we'll be."
Love is, indeed, a many splendored thing.

Hungry for intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: For much of the past two decades, the question of how to resolve America's acute shortage of affordable housing has been strikingly absent from the dominant national discourse.
Even after $1 trillion in bad mortgages nearly blew up the nation's financial system, presidential candidates in the 2012 and 2016 elections did not release detailed housing plans. The fact that America's urban landscape was undergoing a radical shift - in which millions of young and middle-class Americans were being priced out of large cities because of runaway housing prices - was still overshadowed by more immediate concerns, like rising health care costs and the loss of factory jobs.
That changed abruptly over the past year, as the consequences of the nation's affordable housing crisis became too visible to ignore. Rents had jumped so high in some cities that firefighters and schoolteachers could no longer afford to live near their jobs. Large homeless camps were sprouting up near the centers of once-affordable cities, from Austin, Texas, to Minneapolis to Seattle. Suddenly housing was on the national agenda.
Anyone seeking a political remedy to the housing problem would do well to read Conor Dougherty's "Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America," a painstakingly researched and penetrating analysis of the economic and political forces behind America's most dysfunctional housing market: San Francisco. Dougherty traces the dire scarcity of affordable housing to warped policies dating back to World War II, as well as to exclusionist ordinances closely intertwined with America's obsession with single-family homeownership.
Dougherty, an economics reporter at The New York Times, makes a persuasive case that America's affordable housing shortage cannot be explained by market forces alone; rather it is, at its core, a problem of politics and power. A major culprit is the widespread use of exclusionary zoning - local government ordinances that designate entire communities solely for those who can afford single-family homes, often with minimum lot sizes.
The local restrictions have conspired to limit the supply of housing in large cities - the very places where jobs and economic opportunity have become increasingly concentrated, Dougherty writes.
The results are soaring rents and an unconscionable housing gap: In America's cities, there are only 37 affordable apartment units for every 100 low-income renters. Between 2011 and 2017, nearly four million low-cost units that rent for under $800 a month have vanished from the nation's housing stock, according to an annual report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University.
These nationwide trends have been magnified in California - where anti-growth movements and "Not-in-my-backyard" (NIMBY) activism have been a fixture of the political landscape since the 1970s. But Dougherty avoids the tendency, common in books about economic hardship, to portray people as passive victims of forces beyond their control. Instead, he provides us with richly layered portraits of people seeking, in different ways, to correct the injustices caused by ruthless speculation and exclusionary housing policies. They include a young math teacher so frustrated by sky-high rents that she builds a national movement of pro-housing agitators, known as YIMBY (Yes-in-my-backyard); a Catholic nun who battles real estate speculators; and a city manager who quits his job rather than continue to support exclusionary zoning measures.
Dougherty does not shy away from the complexity of his subject matter, and he illuminates the many contradictions of national and local housing policies.
Lost in the debate on rent control, for instance, is the recognition that America has long sought to protect homeowners from wild swings in housing prices by subsidizing fixed-rate mortgages. Rent control, he notes, is little more than an attempt by tenants to get the same kind of protections as homeowners.
Ultimately, Dougherty concludes, "There's no way to rectify a housing shortage other than to build housing, and there's no way to take care of people whom the private market won't take care of other than subsidies or rent control, or both. The details are democracy."

Don't expect instant results on election nights

Texto completo: The contrast between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary offers two lessons for the media and the public, especially for the next two contests in Nevada and South Carolina: Put your trust in professional election administrators, and don't expect an immediate announcement of the winner.
The Iowa Democratic Party, not election professionals, ran the caucuses. The party made mistakes at several turns. It transmitted and tabulated results using a new app that turned out to be unreliable. It then compounded those errors by rushing to report results, which appeared incomplete and potentially inaccurate, over the ensuing days.
By contrast, New Hampshire election officials administered the primary. They did it without any hiccups and, importantly, there seemed to be less of a rush to announce the winner.
The Nevada Democratic Party were in charge of Feb. 22's caucuses won by Bernie Sanders, while state election officials were in charge of Saturday's South Carolina primary. Nevada Democrats are trying to learn from the experience of their Iowa counterparts, but the bottom line is unavoidable: The practice of nonprofessionals administering caucuses adds another reason to question the entire caucus system, which is generally undemocratic and unrepresentative to begin with.
The other problem is our impatience to know the outcome. Regardless of who is running an election, the news media and the public should let the process play out without demanding immediate results. Spending several days to determine an election winner is a feature, not a bug, of election administration. We must all temper our expectations on election night.
The danger here is that media frenzies over late or even less than immediate results can undermine public faith in our elections. In Iowa, just as the caucuses ended, journalists and political pundits were spreading wild speculation that something was "amiss" just because the state party had not released results quickly enough. President Donald Trump's campaign then picked up on that rampant speculation, with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeting, "Quality control = rigged?"
No. Quality control means that the state Democratic Party did not want to release results that were inaccurate or numbers they would have to amend in the days that followed. How much worse would it be to release initial results that then changed or that they could not verify as abundantly accurate?
We actually know how bad that can be. The Iowa Democratic Party initially released partial numbers the day after the caucuses, with additional results trickling out later that week. A New York Times analysis has revealed that those vote totals had internal inconsistencies. Candidates were justifiably upset.
It is quite likely that some of these mistakes – especially manual tabulation errors – were due to the zeal to release results. Humans are fallible, and even more so when we rush. The state party was under immense pressure, just minutes after the caucuses ended, to tell us who won.
It was the perfect storm: The party was rolling out a new system in which it reported three sets of results, using a new, untested app to tabulate the numbers from caucus sites, and all in an environment where everyone was clamoring for an immediate announcement of the winner.
Of course, delays should not take forever. We don't need to emulate Afghanistan, which just named the winner of a bitterly disputed presidential election that took place five months ago. But a reasonable delay in vote totals should become the norm in America. We should let election administrators – especially those like in Iowa and Nevada who do not do this for a living – take their time to go through the ballots and confirm their accuracy.
Let's remember election night 2018, when some pundits did not wait for West Coast results before deeming Democrats' hoped-for blue wave a bust. Eventually, but not immediately, results from California and other states made the wave a reality. But the normal delay in processing ballots still opened the door for Republicans to speculate about irregularities and plant doubts about the count.
Now imagine election night 2020. It takes time to tabulate results, especially in states with a lot of mail-in ballots. We might not know the winner right away. But if the public and the news media demand immediate vote totals, and if election officials rush in an effort to cede to those demands, then we could be in for a terrible scenario: uncertainty about who actually won the presidential election amid wild allegations of something amiss.
Let's instead take a deep breath and let the process work itself out slowly. Delays should not undermine the public's faith in our election system. Campaigns should not use this media narrative to plant unfounded ideas of electoral shenanigans. Election officials should not rush their processes due to media pressure.
All of this is dangerous for its potential to diminish confidence in our democratic process.
Instead, we should give those who run our elections time to do their jobs and produce accurate results. American democracy won't break down if we have to wait a few hours or days to find out the winner of the Nevada caucuses or South Carolina primary.

Sonny's favorite movie

Texto completo: Like any film buff, Sonny Franzese had a favorite movie. His was "The Godfather."
"Terrific movie. I think it's one of the best movies ever made," Franzese said in an interview at his nursing home. The sequel, "Godfather Part II," was "fantastic."
His appraisal was based, in part, on the lead actors, several of whom he said he knew. Al Pacino, who played mob patriarch Vito Corleone's son Michael, was his favorite. "He's a nice guy, Al," Franzese said. "Hell of an actor, hell of an actor. I think he's about the best actor around today." Pacino, he said, can "play anything."
He also liked Robert DeNiro, who portrayed a young Vito Corleone in "Godfather Part II." "DeNiro is a good, uh, second," he opined.
Franzese's critical eye was informed by his unique expertise, as well, according to his son, John Jr. When they watched "Godfather Part II" together, the story of Vito Corleone's early life as a young Italian immigrant in Hell's Kitchen, Franzese had particularly acute insights.
That became evident during the scene of the funeral for Vito's wife, the mother of the movie's three dissimilar sons. There, Michael, the son now leading the family, and Fredo, the older brother who had betrayed him, embrace.
Up to that moment, John Jr. said, "Michael was never going to kill him." Then his father tracked the moment when Michael's feelings changed. "He said if you notice when Michael hugged him, [Fredo]  came with a gun," John recalled.
A close viewing of the scene shows no obvious gun, just a hand with a watch - Michael's hand - on Fredo's back. It pauses briefly, as if he felt a gun, although it is not clear. But to Franzese, that moment was crystal clear.
As John Jr. related, "The fact that you brought a gun to a funeral to meet your family meant that you didn't feel safe anymore when Michael said come back."
If he didn't trust them, they couldn't trust him. Fredo had to go.
In John's view it was the kind of insight into Mafia life that only someone who lived it could have, which is why Franzese refused to believe the movie was a work of pure fiction. Mario Puzo, who wrote the 1969 bestseller on which the movie is based and who died in 1999, always insisted it was.
"He had to get it from a mob guy," Franzese said. "Puzo couldn't get that information himself. He had to get it from somebody."
And Franzese believed Corleone's oldest son, the libidinous and hot-tempered Sonny, was named for him. He said the idea may have been planted with Puzo by mob boss Joe (Joe Bananas) Bonanno, who was unpopular within the Mafia because he constantly maneuvered against other bosses.
Bonanno, Franzese said, wanted to make him look bad because he was jealous of him.
Puzo, who wrote a memoir before he died, denied knowing any gangsters. He did, however, admit to heavy gambling, which, through bookmaking and loan sharking, was the province of mobsters.
"Puzo knew me good," Franzese said, declining to elaborate.
Gianni Russo, the actor who played Carlo in the film, said he also knew Puzo. He said Puzo told him his characters were composites of mobsters he researched, adding that Franzese was "a legend."
Regardless of the work's genesis, the movie never would have been made without the help of the Colombo family.
After hearing of filming plans in New York in 1970, Joe Colombo, then head of the Colombo family, used his Italian American Civil Rights League to protest what he said would be an ethnically biased film. Colombo publicly denied there was a Mafia, calling it an ethnic slur.
The pressure escalated when the movie's producers found themselves blocked from working at already approved locations and getting threatening phone calls, according to news accounts at the time.
They sat down with Colombo and reached an agreement: In exchange for hiring some Colombo associates as extras and striking the words "Cosa Nostra" from the film, their troubles would be over, according to a 1972 New York Times article. Among those who gained employment was Lenny Montana, a 300-pound Colombo enforcer who played the loyal hit man Luca Brasi and who happened to be the uncle of a Nassau detective who once arrested Franzese for a parole violation..
Such business dealings were Franzese's special area of expertise. Tony Napoli, the son of the late Genovese capo Jimmy Napoli, said Franzese was a "consultant" on the film.
"The word 'consultant' is not the word that they used," Napoli said in an interview. "They would come to a man like Sonny, different areas, OK them to do shooting there. Otherwise, your trailers would be missing, if you know what I mean."
Asked about that, Franzese denied it emphatically.
He was in prison at the time of the filming, though friends say he conducted business even behind bars.
Franzese also professed a close connection to actors in the movie, in particular James Caan, the actor who played Sonny. Franzese said he got to know him "through the picture."
That connection emerged in film credits later when the crime drama, "This Thing of Ours," about the Mafia and starring Caan, was made in 2003. Franzese is listed as an associate producer, even though he was not impressed by the final product.
"That was a baloney movie," he said.

Texto completo: Valley News Columnist
Last month, I told the story of Art Pistey, a longtime Upper Valley chiropractor who takes a cutting-edge — and pricey — prescription drug to help keep his multiple sclerosis in check.
Pistey is among roughly 90,000 MS patients in the U.S. who have been prescribed Ocrevus, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in 2017.
Every six months, Pistey, who lives in Canaan, goes to a hospital for an intravenous infusion that takes about six hours.
For an infusion that Pistey received at Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital in June 2018, his insurance company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, paid the hospital about $22,500. Pistey paid an additional $3,700 in out-of-pocket costs, bringing the total tab for the drug to more than $26,000.
Shortly thereafter, Pistey turned 65, making him eligible for Medicare, the federal government’s health insurance program for older Americans.
In July 2019, Pistey received another infusion at APD. The hospital billed a whopping $178,750 for the one dose of Ocrevus, but Medicare capped payment at only $117,000. After Medicare paid $80,581, Pistey was left with a balance of more than $35,000.
Fortunately, Pistey, who is self-employed, can afford private supplemental insurance to help pay portions of bills not covered under Medicare. In this instance, his private insurer kicked in the balance.
How can the amount APD receives for a dose of Ocrevus go from roughly $26,000 to $117,000 — a $91,000 increase — in one year?
As I wrote last month, APD told me that it had made an error when billing for the 2018 infusion. Pistey was charged less than one-half the amount he should have been, a hospital spokesman said.
So why am I revisiting Pistey’s case now?
With the 2020 presidential race heating up, the amount that Americans pay for many prescription drugs is a kitchen-table issue. It’s a problem that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree needs fixing. How rare is that?
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a gastroenterologist before entering Congress, told The Wall Street Journal, “If I go to church and there is a Bernie Sanders supporter and a Donald Trump supporter pulling my lapels, it’s probably about drug prices.”
Pharmaceutical companies have become a poster child for corporate greed. Insurance companies, and their executives’ lavish salaries, are under fire too.
But Elisabeth Rosenthal, a physician and contributing opinion writer at The New York Times, has pointed out that another major component of America’s $3.5 trillion health care system deserves more public scrutiny.
In September, Rosenthal wrote that politicians on “both the left and right let hospitals off scot-free.”
She argues “it’s easy to get voters riled up about a drug maker in Silicon Valley or an insurer in Hartford (Conn.). It’s much riskier to try to direct their venom at the place where their children were born; that employed their parents as nurses, doctors and orderlies; that sponsored local Little League teams; that was associated with their Catholic Church.”
Maybe that’s why hospitals can get away with charging $15 for an aspirin. Or $178,750 for a drug to treat MS, an incurable central nervous system disease that affects up to one million people in the U.S. (I gave an outdated lower figure in last month’s column.)
Ocrevus’ list price — $32,500 per dose, or $65,000 annually — hasn’t changed since the FDA approved its use three years ago, a spokesman for Genentech, the California biotech company that developed Ocrevus, told me.
“However, hospital systems have the ability to mark up the cost of intravenous treatments and other medicines,” Genentech’s Justin Hurdle wrote in an email. “Markups are driving higher cost sharing and increasing insurance premiums across the country.”
APD’s response? “It’s important to remember payers” — in other words, both public and private insurers — “establish the rate for what they will pay the hospital for total treatment,” Peter Glenshaw, APD’s vice president of external affairs, wrote in an email. Total treatment includes not only drug costs, but other expenses such as administering the drug, he said. The hospital’s fixed costs, such as electric and heating bills, also figure into what patients are charged, he added.
In last month’s column, I wrote that it was likely Blue Cross, or a pharmacy benefit management company working on its behalf, had negotiated a discount below the drug’s list price. Hurdle said that wasn’t the case.
“Genentech does not offer rebates or discounts to insurance companies for Ocrevus, as we do not see that to be an effective way to reduce costs for MS patients,” he wrote.
For Pistey, Ocrevus has been a life-changer. He can work and remain physically active without the side effects that came with the MS drug he took before his neurologist prescribed Ocrevus.
In the campaign to reduce prescription drug prices, much is being made — and for good reason — of the billions the pharmaceutical industry spends on marketing to consumers and doctors.
Many hospitals play the marketing game as well. Take Dartmouth-Hitchcock, the mega health care organization that has brought APD and three other community hospitals under its umbrella in recent years. D-H employs a small in-house army to market its “brand” and spin hospital news to its liking.
D-H’s website boasts of a communications and marketing department with a vice president, a senior director and seven directors.
Before Pistey’s most recent Ocrevus infusion in January, he was told to go to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, the crown jewel in the D-H system. APD no longer provides the service.
Last week I stopped by Pistey’s office in White River Junction. He hasn’t received a bill from DHMC for his January visit.
I wait with bated breath.

Texto completo: What does the hard-won, long-overdue conviction of Harvey Weinstein demonstrate? It shows how difficult it can be to bring abusers to justice, particularly when they are wealthy and powerful. It shows how much the #MeToo movement has changed American life. And it shows how far society still has to go.
Weinstein, long one of the most powerful movie producers in Hollywood, was convicted on Monday of a felony sex crime and rape in the third degree but was acquitted of the most serious counts against him, predatory sexual assault. He is headed for at least five years in prison. That’s a victory for Weinstein’s victims.
But the Weinstein case shows the obstacles presented by the American legal system to successfully prosecuting abusers. The case, tried in a Manhattan courtroom, rested on testimony from just six women out of the more than 90 who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. (He also faces charges in Los Angeles of raping one woman and groping and masturbating in front of another.) It took decades of persistence by survivors, advocates, journalists and law enforcement to call Weinstein to account before the law. In 2015, Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, declined to prosecute credible allegations against Weinstein. Vance acted years later only after dozens of women went public with their allegations.
Weinstein’s prosecutors were able to break through a barrier common to many assault cases, a lack of physical or other corroborating evidence. And they also overcame another, even more fundamental barrier: basic mistrust of women alleging sexual assault.
Women have internalized that message of mistrust. Despite the far-reaching message of #MeToo, a vast majority of sexual assault victims — estimated to be more than three-quarters of them — never report their attackers to the authorities. Many have been conditioned to feel ashamed, as though the assault was their fault; those who know it wasn’t still have little faith in a criminal justice system that routinely disregards the testimony of victims.
If a more balanced legal approach to sexual assault is going to become the norm instead of the exception, then, for a start, the law needs to change. State statutes of limitations need to be extended or eliminated to give victims the opportunity to come forward even years after a traumatic assault. Now, in some states, the statute of limitations for felony sex crimes expires after 10 years or less. (In Vermont, aggravated sexual assault has no statute of limitations while felony sex assault has a six-year limitation. Many sexual offenses against children carry a 40-year period of limitations. In New Hampshire, the statute of limitations for felonious sexual assault is six years; one year for sexual assault. The statute of limitations for sexual assault of a victim under 18 runs until the victim is 40 years old.)
Enforcement needs to change as well. Law enforcement authorities need to let women know that they will be listened to, and that their cases will be prosecuted quickly and thoroughly. Victims need to have confidence that their attacker’s DNA won’t be stashed away for decades in a file cabinet.
Weinstein’s lead lawyer said her client was simply “a target of a cause and of a movement.” That’s correct — if the cause is holding sexual abusers to account, and the movement is the national shift in consciousness over these crimes that arose in large part out of the revelation of Weinstein’s behavior. So his conviction, too, stands for something larger: that some measure of justice can be attained, and with it the balance of power between sexual predators and their victims can begin to shift.

Texto completo: Bloomberg
Here's the good news about President Donald Trump's call for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to recuse themselves from all future cases involving his administration: It won't move the two stalwart liberal justices an inch.
Better still, questions of any justices' recusals are decided by – you guessed it – the justices themselves. Sotomayor and Ginsburg can do whatever they want, and that isn't going to include being pushed around by Trump, or by anyone else for that matter.
Nevertheless, it's serious business that Trump has suggested that there were “obviously inappropriate” things in Sotomayor's recent dissent criticizing his administration for repeatedly seeking emergency actions from the Supreme Court. Trump is wrong: There's nothing improper in the dissent.
It's perfectly appropriate for justices to criticize an administration's legal positions in strong terms. What's really inappropriate is that the president of the United States is trying to undercut the legitimacy of individual liberal justices – and of the Supreme Court itself. That isn't normal and it isn't okay.
Trump's feud with Ginsburg goes back to 2016. The details show how perfectly ordinary Sotomayor's dissent was.
In July 2016 interviews with the New York Times's Adam Liptak and then with CNN's reporter Joan Biskupic, Ginsburg expressed outrage at the prospect of the Trump presidency. She told Liptak, “I can't imagine what the Supreme Court would be – I can't imagine what the country would be – with Donald Trump as our president.” To Biskupic she said that Trump was a “faker.”
When Trump hit back, Ginsburg apologized, saying in an official statement that her comments were “ill-advised and I regret making them. Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office.”
That back-and-forth stands in sharp contrast to Sotomayor's dissent (which, it's worth noting, Ginsburg did not join.)
The case involved the Trump administration's plan to refuse green cards to people whom it predicts might conceivably in the future qualify for public benefits like Medicaid or food stamps. A lower federal court judge in Illinois had issued an order blocking the administration from implementing the policy in that court's jurisdiction, on the view that the plan is unlawful.
The Trump administration went to the Supreme Court to ask it to lift the lower court's order and enable it to start applying its policy in Illinois.
Ordinarily, before the Supreme Court will intervene to overturn a lower court's order, there have to be special circumstances – like an emergency situation that would cause irreparable harm to the government if the order remains in place. To suggest that the circumstances were appropriate for lifting the order, the administration insisted – outrageously, it must be said – that there was an emergency need for the Trump policy to take effect right away and that the government would suffer irreparable harm if the administration's plan had to wait while the case made its way to the court of appeals and then to the Supreme Court.
Such emergency appeals have become commonplace during the Trump years, mostly in response to the fact that lower courts have frequently issued orders staying the Trump administration's most blatantly unlawful executive orders or policy plans.
Sotomayor's dissent pointed out, first, that this was not a nationwide injunction issued by a single district court. Last month, the justices by a vote of 5 to 4 had overturned one such nationwide injunction, issued by a federal district court in New York.
But the Illinois injunction didn't block the Trump administration from implementing its plan altogether; just from implementing it in Illinois. Sotomayor said that it was “troubling” that the court was now issuing such emergency orders “as a matter of course.” So far, that's a fairly temperate critique.
Sotomayor then marched through the various elements that the government is supposed to prove to get the extraordinary relief of lifting a lower court order. She concluded the government hadn't met its burden. This kind of criticism is also completely normal.
The only tough language in her dissent came when she argued that the government had begun to treat the “exceptional mechanism” of seeking to flip a lower court order “as a new normal.” In the course of making that argument, she wrote that the government had been “claiming one emergency after another” – which is true. “With each successive application, of course,” she went on, the government's “cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow.”
That was an expression of her point of view, namely that a government that keeps on insisting on emergencies loses credibility over time. As the Supreme Court's language goes, this was hardly a major declaration. Compare it to the late Justice Antonin Scalia's insistence in his dissent from the court's decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act that the majority opinion consisted of “legalistic argle-bargle.”
Trump was clearly wrong to say there was anything inappropriate about Sotomayor's dissent. So why say it?
What the president is doing is pretty obvious. He's trying to convince his supporters that the justices are biased against him and that any time they rule against his administration it must be out of personal animus or unfairness.
Chief Justice John Roberts won't like this. He voted with the majority in this case; but he wants to uphold the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. Trump wants to tear down that very same legitimacy.
It's hard to escape the conclusion that, having shown his mastery over Congress by escaping conviction in his impeachment trial, Trump now wants to take on the third branch of government, namely the court. It won't work. Yet the legitimacy of any government body can be affected by repeated attacks. The chief justice should issue a public statement in response to Trump, as he has occasionally done in the past. Sotomayor has nothing to apologize for.

I won’t just write humorous pieces

Texto completo: Brushing aside writing only humorous pieces about things locally, J.P. Devine says he won't stop trying to be a big city conversationalist.
This week I decided to write about Bernie Sanders, the Rasputin from Vermont’s great adventure in Las Vegas. But before I hit the first keys, Bernie had packed up his pills and was on his way to California.
Mayor Pete was already deep in South Carolina, picking out the drapes for the vice president’s office. Things are moving way too fast for me.
But then I remember the playwright Neil Simon (“The Odd Couple”) writing, “The closer we get to the bottom, the faster things go.” Well, I can see the bottom from here, and one state after another is flying by.
I’m told that the smart thing for me to do is to stop trying to be a big city polemicist, and stick to writing humorous pieces about things locally.
It was suggested that I might sit in my car in front of the grand new Lockwood Hotel on Main Street in Waterville, and write about its progress, as in: “BREAKING NEWS: Worker accidentally drops hammer from atop roof of newly constructed Lockwood Hotel.”
Or, “Spacious, clean windows finally installed in amazing new Lockwood Hotel. Views coming later.”
Not realistic. I just have to adjust to the fact that I am not a true local journalist like Amy Calder or Taylor Abbott, who appear to cover all the exciting, breaking news even before it happens.
Too old to apply for a job with the Washington Post or the New York Times, I attempted to write more locally by covering the workers who are holding up traffic on Temple Street.
BREAKING NEWS: Pot holes on Temple Street are currently being filled with hot tar, and the water pipe breaks in front of Applebee’s on KMD have been repaired. You may now visit Applebee’s and Planet Fitness. How am I doin’?
Amy Calder just texted me and wrote, “Cut it out.” So I’m back to Bernie and the next debate.
I forced myself to watch the February Democratic debate at the Paris Theater in Las Vegas on Feb. 19.
Did you watch? What did you see? This is what Donald J. Trump and the Republican Senate saw:
• Two angry housewives, an 18-year-old high school gay honor student Eagle Scout who kept interrupting the two housewives, two balding white-haired old men who looked like they had just missed the early bird 4 p.m. dinner and the last screening of “Sound of Music” in the recreation room. They also saw Joe Biden wandering around looking for the men’s room.
• What did I see? As the class of 2020 flailed frantically about the dais, I saw Miss Endres’ afternoon English class at Cleveland High School in 1948 flash before my eyes. There she was, Miss Ellen Endres, a tall, gorgeous, blonde substitute teacher trying to hold her own as my fellow classmates waved their arms as they screamed for attention.
“Over here, Miss Endres, pick me, Miss Endres. I know the answer, Miss Endres, call on me next.”
As an American voter, I was stunned, embarrassed, humiliated and sick to my stomach. I remembered Charlton Heston in “Planet of the Apes” sitting on a beach, when he saw the Statue of Liberty sticking out of the sand, and he cried, “You poor, dumb SOBs, what did you do?”
I saw the political version of the Hindenburg blimp going down, the burning of the Reichstag, the wicked witch in the “Wizard of Oz” melting into a puddle of grease. Miss Endres would say I was a drama queen. That I am.
I saw Bernie — whom some see as a full-blown socialist anarchist, a modern Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, at the Finland Station on his way to forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics — shouting and shaking his fist at Mike Bloomberg for trying to buy the election with cash.
Really? This is Bernie, the well meaning socialist Pied Piper clearly trying to buy the votes of his hordes of children with promises of free college education, health care for themselves, their parents and ex-boyfriends, and yes, a pony.
Colby’s Professor Rodman will caution me that it’s much more than that, and that I’m overreacting too soon. After Super Tuesday, overreacting will be allowed.
I kept waiting for Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow, and especially Jose Diaz-Balart, whose voice reaches deep into the Latino world, to simply ask this class, each of them, what specific plans they had to de-throne Donald Trump.
No, they just kept waving for attention and continued throwing spitballs at Mayor Bloomberg.
Miss Endres, if you’re still alive, I didn’t wave my hand that day because I was mesmerized by your blue eyes.
But I’m waving it now. Call on me, Miss Endres. I need a column.
Wait. Hold on. Hobby Lobby in Waterville just finished erecting their new sign. I have to get up there quick before Amy.

Texto completo: PARIS -- The ceremony for the French version of the Oscars took place in Paris on Friday amid protests by women's rights activists as director Roman Polanski was awarded best director for his latest film.
Polanski decided to skip the Cesar awards ceremony because of protests by women's groups denouncing the 12 nominations "An Officer and a Spy" received after a French woman brought a new rape accusation against him.
At the announcement of Polanski's award as best director, boos emerged from the public made of film and cinema professionals.
Actress Adele Haenel, who recently denounced alleged sexual assault by another French director in the early 2000s when she was 15, got up and walked out of the room, followed by a few others. "Distinguishing Polanski is spitting in the face of all victims. It means raping women isn't that bad," Haenel told the New York Times earlier this week.
The film's cast and production team, including best actor nominee Jean Dujardin, also declined to attend the ceremony. Dujardin posted a message on Instagram that said, "By making this film, I believed and I still believe I made more good than harm."
Polanski's film won two other awards for best costume design and best adaptation. No one came on stage to accept the trophies awarded to "An Officer and a Spy."
The show's host, comedian Florence Foresti, left Polanski's film out of her opening remarks when she mentioned the ones with multiple nominations. Instead, Foresti referred to the 86-year-old director as "Atchoum," French for the Sneezy character in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"I decided that Atchoum would not be big enough to overshadow the French cinema," she said.
The Cesar for best film has been awarded to "Les Miserables," Ladj Ly's Oscar candidate, about tensions between police and minorities in a poor Paris suburb. The film won the Jury Price in Cannes Film Festival last year.
The entire male-dominated leadership of the Cesar stepped down recently amid disagreement over its decision-making structure and how to deal with the Polanski problem.
A few hundred protesters brandishing signs with phrases such as "Victims, we believe you" and "No to impunity" assembled outside the Salle Pleyel hall before the ceremony started. The group chanted, "We are here, we are here, even if Polanski doesn't want to, we are here."
"By supporting the aggressors, by celebrating the aggressors, one does not allow the victims to speak out. Their word is denied," Celine Piques of women's activist group Osez le Feminisme said
In a statement this week, the Paris-based Polanski said the ceremony was turning into a "public lynching" and that he decided not to attend the ceremony to protect his colleagues and his wife and children.
Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor but fled the country on the eve of sentencing.
Last year, a woman came forward to accuse Polanski of raping her in 1975 in his Swiss chalet when she was 18. Polanski denied it, and the allegations are too old for an investigation.
But the accusation put the director under fresh scrutiny in France, where he has long been revered as one of the country's premier filmmakers despite the outstanding rape charge in the U.S. Other accusations have also emerged.
"Is it normal for a man to rape and then 30 years later to be a star in popular cultures? No, it's not normal, and a rapist should be in prison," another Osez le Feminisme activist, Fabienne El Khouri, said.
"An Officer and a Spy" is about the anti-Semitic persecution of French army Capt. Alfred Dreyfus and his wrongful treason conviction in the 1890s.

MULTISTATE INVESTIGATION OF JUUL COULD MEAN A SETTLEMENT SOONER THAN LATER, EXPERTS SAY 39 STATES, INCLUDING EIGHT WHO ALREADY SUED JUUL, BAND TOGETHER

Texto completo: If there was any question whether states wanted to push Juul, the company blamed for the teenage vaping epidemic, into a global settlement as they have with Big Tobacco and are currently doing with opioid-related companies, the announcement of an investigation agreement by 39 states put that to rest.
The agreement - trumpeted as a "bipartisan multistate investigation" by the attorneys general - is likely to "ramp up the pressure," as Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro put it in his press release Tuesday announcing the state's participation, and hasten the move from court to settlement with Juul, experts said.
"Thirty-nine states are taking part. That fact alone just ups the stakes exponentially for Juul and increases the incentive for them to reach a universal settlement," said Doug Blanke, executive director of the Public Health Law Center, an anti-tobacco advocacy group based in St. Paul, Minn.
Paul Nolette, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University and an expert on the politics of state attorneys general, noted, "It was already bad enough when big states like California, New York and Pennsylvania had gone after them.
"Now [Juul] is in some real trouble now with 39 states coming after them together," he said. "It creates even more pressure to settle."
One aspect that could be significant, said Tina Batra Hershey, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, is that all the first eight states but one (Arizona) have Democratic attorneys general. Getting 39 states involved shows it's clearly now a bipartisan issue.
"I think at this point we're at that stage in this process that there is enough feeling that this [vaping] goes across party lines and is a national problem," Ms. Hershey said.
While other companies sell vaping products, Juul controls about 75% of the emerging U.S. market, having sold about $3.4 billion worth last year.
"It's understandable the focus of state lawsuits is Juul," said Dennis Henigan, vice president for legal and regulatory affairs for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. "Because Juul almost single-handedly created this epidemic of youth addiction that's caused such enormous social harm."
Since Juul is now one-third owned by Altria, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, it could be expected to fight like a Big Tobacco company "tooth and nail" in the lawsuits filed by the eight states, including Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Mr. Blanke said.
But the sheer number of state attorneys general now using "pre-litigation discovery powers that counties" and private attorneys don't have could prove daunting, he pointed out.
That has already started to happen in the initial eight state lawsuits.
Although the suits all share a common theme of Juul improperly targeting teenagers with deceptive advertising and misleading sciences, each so far has had new wrinkles.
Massachusetts, for example, dug into Juul's online advertising and found the company had bought ads on kid-friendly websites for both the Nick Jr. and Cartoon Network channels - revelations that brought even further condemnation.
In its standard response since it was first sued by North Carolina in May, Juul said in response to Massachusetts' lawsuit that it wanted to work with attorneys general and others ". to combat underage use and transition adult smokers from combustible cigarettes."
An official from the Massachusetts attorney general's office quipped if the goal was to get a 40-year-old mother of two to stop smoking cigarettes, rather than advertise on Nick Jr. and Cartoon Network, the company would be better off advertising on The New York Times website.
Pennsylvania's lawsuit, filed Feb. 10 in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia County, drilled into two aspects of Juul's science and advertising that had not been as thoroughly explored before.
The first was taking a closer look at how Juul depicted its nicotine "absorption rate" - a measure of how fast the nicotine that users inhaled from vaping got into a person's body. The state's lawsuit documents how Juul not only allegedly was intentionally misleading with its packaging in-formation but also obscured data in its patent application.
In another section of the lawsuit, Pennsylvania explained how Juul, in its early promotional efforts in 2015, targeted towns in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania by offering people free samples at Sheetz, Wawa and Rutter's convenience stores.
Using young attractive models, the lawsuit points out, the company's representatives set up tables with samples of Juul products, offering free puffs so people could see how it works, how it tastes and the effect it had, and then gave them for free the rest of the pod that held the nicotine liquid to take home.
"It's a highly engaging method of marketing," said Joe Swartz, deputy attorney general with the Tobacco Enforcement section of the office, who is the lead attorney for Pennsylvania's case. "It puts the products and paid spokespeople in confined spaces near candy and soda, places kids go."
Kar-Hai Chu, a University of Pittsburgh researcher who has studied social media's role in the popularity of vaping among teenagers, said the lawsuit agrees with research he and others have found.
"We know that Juul has targeted kids on social media, and study after study shows they had an impact" on kids vaping, he said. "It wasn't about trying to find a 55-year-old 20-year smoker and getting them to quit."
The issues Mr. Shapiro's lawsuit focused on "are targets we as researchers have focused on."
Neil English, instructional principal at Riverview School District's junior/senior high school in Oakmont, who has overseen his school's anti-vaping efforts, was glad to see the state file its lawsuit, and not just because it might bring Juul to change its ways.
"It helps, because any sort of negative pressure against the vaping industry is good," he said. "Just having the medical issues [from vaping lung injury cases in the past year] in the press in recent months has helped kids understand that it's not safe."

FIX THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATES FORMAT? GOT DYNAMITE?

Texto completo: The next Democratic debate is scheduled for March 15, affording the relevant authorities plenty of time to tweak the format - and by "tweak," I mean, of course, obliterate with explosives.
Who on God's Earth thinks what CBS mashed into a prime-time broadcast Tuesday is the way a modern presidential debate ought to be presented?
I suppose it's possible there was some midlevel corporate operative deep within the network's programming division who wobbled away from the 10th debate of this election cycle thinking, "Yeah, that was fine," but the rest of us are still trying to decide who should be most embarrassed: the candidates, the moderators, the live audience or the people watching at home hoping for some trace of clarity. Aren't they adorable?
Let's start on stage and work our way back.
The candidates, now reduced to seven from the original 189, clearly prefer one of two basic optics. It's either one person speaking while the rest try to flag down their Uber, or it's everyone talking at once. If I want a TV show where everyone talks at the same time, I'll watch "The View."
The primary strategy on stage is to attack the candidate who projects as the most likely to achieve actual momentum in the moment. It was Joe Biden in the early going, then Mike Bloomberg, then Bernie Sanders on Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren, who eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg in Nevada last week, did it again Tuesday just for the hell of it. One or more of these people should have the option, for at least one debate, to wear one of those gray noncontact jerseys the injured Penguins put on at practice. Bernie could have pulled one on Tuesday and saved himself plenty of grief.
The whole attack strategy is not only misguided, but it sucks the rhetorical life from the whole purpose of the debate, to inform that portion of the public that cares enough to tune in. Attacks should be aimed at the incumbent. This is a one-issue election - one - and it's President Donald Trump. Moreover, there is one qualification - one - and it's electability. No one is tuning in to see what Pete Buttigieg thinks of Amy Klobuchar.
For a few minutes Tuesday, it appeared Mr. Biden had figured this out. Near the middle of the stage, he kept a regal posture in quiet bemusement while the others savaged each other. Joe looked almost presidential, but he eventually found a groove from which he complained about the monitors over and over (not that they didn't have it coming).
When CBS monitor Gayle King warned candidates to stick to their allotted time, Mr. Biden chirped, "Good idea!"
When Ms. King replied, "We'll get to you," Mr. Biden said, "You keep saying that, but you haven't done it yet." When the former vice president did talk, he mostly complained about being restricted: "Why am I stopping? No one else stops. Gentlemen don't get very well treated up here."
So Joe made himself into a victim, which was totally useless and seemingly ignorant of the fact that victimization is Mr. Trump's lane exclusively ("Very unfair!").
As for the moderators, Ms. King and Norah O'Donnell were definitively steamrolled by just about everyone on stage, thus affixing to what is supposed to be a very serious event the general flavor of a bar fight you're listening to from the backroom.
Separately and together, Ms. King and Ms. O'Donnell failed spectacularly. The questions they plucked from Twitter were better than those they asked themselves, which were transparently calibrated to ignite fireworks rather than add to anyone's understanding of the issues. Forty-two minutes in, they were reinforced for a time by Major Garrett, Bill Whitaker and Margaret Brennan, but the horses had fled the barn.
In the end, rather than provide time to each candidate for a summation or a closing statement, CBS decided to ask each about their "motto" and to reveal a "misconception about you."
What, it's "The Dating Game" now?
No one watching for the first time could sit through two hours and 15 minutes of this and come away thinking America is a serious country. When we produce the presidential debates like a very special Tuesday night edition of World Wrestling Entertainment's "Monday Night Raw," with pulsating music at the top and a live audience that acted like it had walked in from a tailgate, we aren't really serious.
When Ms. Klobuchar mentioned the so-called Charleston loophole - a hole in the applicable gun law that enabled Dylann Roof to get the weapon he used to murder nine people at a Charleston, S.C., church - some yahoo shouted out like his hometown had been name-checked by Jimmy Fallon on "The Tonight Show."
"The Big Bang Theory" may be filmed before a live studio audience, but that doesn't mean the presidential debates have to be. It's stupid. If there must be an audience, it has to instructed to sit down and shut up. This would be easier if the networks, particularly the cable channels, weren't so intent on pimping these things like an endless Super Bowl pregame show.
Finally, consider the home audience and the conclusions the networks and the candidates have apparently drawn about us based on this show. How dumb do they think we are? Exactly as dumb as all this appears.
Obviously, I expect all this to be rectified in the next two weeks.
You're welcome.

Texto completo: There are better paths forward for Pennsylvania's economy than a strategy that relies on fracking, petrochemicals and plastics for prosperity.
Despite that, last month our elected leaders in Harrisburg saw fit to approve a bill that will dole out billions in taxpayer subsidies to the fracked gas and petrochemical industries. This legislation - called House Bill 1100 - would tie Pennsylvania's economy to the fossil fuel industry for decades.
Why do our leaders insist on catering to extractive industries when neighboring states are choosing to invest in economically sustainable industries instead ?
In 2018, New York committed $1.5 billion to create 40,000 renewable energy jobs in the state. Those jobs don't just help the economy; they will help New York reach its goal of using 50% renewable energy by 2030.
Look to Ohio, which is a major manufacturer of wind energy components and employs more than 113,000 people in clean-energy jobs, the eighth most in the country.
Look also at our own commonwealth. Since 2014, Pennsylvania has increased its workforce in clean technologies like renewables, energy efficiency, clean vehicles and grid modernization by nearly 60% - employing now twice as many workers as the state's entire fossil fuel industry. There are now 90,772 clean-energy jobs across Pennsylvania.
Why, then, are our leaders still insisting on giving taxpayer handouts to dirty energy and fossil fuels? There is a better path forward, and the days of relying on heavy industry for prosperity should be behind us.
I remain hopeful that Gov. Tom Wolf will veto this horrible legislation, and that our Legislature begins incentivizing industries that provide family-sustaining jobs, long-term economic sustainability and a clean energy future instead of relying on the tried-and-failed polluting, dirty industries of the past.

The Japanese government reported this past week that a woman in Osaka had tested positive for the coronavirus for a second time, weeks after recovering from the infection and being discharged from a hospital.
Combined with reports from China of similar cases, the case in Japan has raised some uncomfortable questions. Reinfections are common among people who have recovered from coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
But those pathogens are very different from the new coronavirus, and experts said it's unlikely that these are cases of people getting infected a second time.
“I'm not saying that reinfection can't occur, will never occur, but in that short time it's unlikely," said Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Even the mildest of infections should leave at least short-term immunity against the virus in the recovering patient, he said.
More likely, the “reinfected" patients still harbored low levels of the virus when they were discharged from the hospital, and testing failed to pick it up.
Even if there were occasional cases of reinfection, they do not seem to be occurring in numbers large enough to be a priority at this point in the outbreak.
One worrisome possibility is that the coronavirus follows what is known as a biphasic infection: The virus persists and causes a different set of symptoms than observed in the initial bout.

Where is the sanitizer?
CEDAR KNOLLS, N.J. — Many shoppers at the local Walmart had the same question on Friday morning: “Where do I find your hand sanitizer?"
The answer: Nowhere.
Employees at the Cedar Knolls store showed shopper after shopper shelves devoid of any hand sanitizer. When an employee found a lone small box of travel packs of Clorox disinfecting wipes high on a shelf, hands reached in, grabbing the packs, three or more at a time.
Asked when more hand sanitizers would be available, the employee shrugged.
A few miles away, at a CVS Health, an employee laughed softly when asked where the hand sanitizers were, pointing to a shelf where only five bottles of CVS's private-label brand sat.
As the coronavirus spreads and people clamor to protect themselves from getting sick, the United States, like other countries, is seeing high demand for items like masks and hand sanitizer.
Most health officials and disease specialists say one of the best preventive measures against the coronavirus or any other outbreak is frequent washing of hands, using soap and water to scrub fronts, backs, and between fingers for at least 20 seconds.
If soap and water aren't available, health professionals say, then hand sanitizer can be used, as long as it contains at least 60 percent alcohol and the gel is squirted onto the hands and rubbed briskly all over them for about 20 seconds.
On Amazon, for instance, a search for popular hand sanitizer brands like Purell, Germ-X, or even Amazon's private-label brand, Solimo, showed many were unavailable.

Surprised by medical bills
Frank Wucinski and his 3-year-old daughter, Annabel, are among the dozens of Americans who the government has flown back to the country from Wuhan, China, and put under quarantine to check for signs of coronavirus.
Now they are among what could become a growing number of families hit with surprise medical bills related to government-mandated actions.
Wucinski, a Pennsylvania native who has lived in China for years, accepted the US government's offer to evacuate from Wuhan with Annabel in early February as the new coronavirus spread. His wife, who is not a US citizen and remains in China, developed pneumonia that doctors think resulted from Covid-19, the disease caused by the respiratory virus.
The first stop for Wucinski and Annabel was a two-week quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar near San Diego. During that time, they had two mandatory stays in an isolation unit at a nearby children's hospital.
Both have repeatedly tested negative for the virus.
After their release from quarantine, Wucinski and Annabel went to stay with his mother in Pennsylvania. That's where they found a pile of bills waiting: $3,918 in charges from hospital doctors, radiologists, and an ambulance company.
“I assumed it was all being paid for," Wucinski said. “We didn't have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my stomach, like, how do I pay for this?"
Patients in the United States regularly confront surprise medical bills that are hard to decode. Wucinski's case suggests that those held in mandatory isolation for suspected coronavirus may be no exception.

Texto completo: Larry Berg owns LAFC. This week he proclaimed that Major League Soccer will, within 10 years, be more popular than big league baseball. "We definitely have the demographics in our favor, both in terms of youth and diversity," he said. "I think we'll pass baseball and hockey and be the No. 3 sport in the U.S. behind football and basketball."
As someone who recalls when MLB was considered the National Pastime, my knee-jerk response was to scoff. As someone who concedes baseball has gone from Pastime to past-its-time, a more considered reaction was to say, "Not so fast." As a professional observer of sports, I ask: What constitutes popularity?
Local angles: The average announced attendance for Atlanta United regular-season home matches in 2019 was 52,910; the AAA for Atlanta Braves regular-season games last year was 32,779. (Put another way, the average Atlanta soccer crowd would spill over at Truist Park.) Does that mean Atlanta United, which has existed for three years, is more popular than the Braves, who've been here since 1966?
Local TV ratings suggest not. Among the peculiarities of baseball is that, while MLB attendance and World Series ratings continue to dip, local TV audiences remain robust. As the New York Times reported in October: "In 2019, 12 of the 29 United States-based major league teams were the most popular prime-time broadcast in their market. An additional seven teams ranked in the top three in prime time. On cable, 24 major league teams ranked first in their market in prime time."
Also: The Braves play 81 regular-season games to Atlanta United's 17. They drew an aggregate 2.655 million in 2019; Atlanta United drew one-third of that. And AUFC isn't the MLS rule; it's a shining exception.
The average MLS crowd last season was 21,310, slightly down from 2018. Only Atlanta United and Seattle averaged more than 27,000 for home dates last year. Yes, soccer stadiums run smaller, but still: On aggregate, every MLB team save Miami outdrew Atlanta United in 2019.
What Berg said about "youth and diversity" is inarguable: MLS plays to a young audience. Baseball's primal fear is the folks who still watch the sport won't be around in 20 years, and there'll be nobody coming behind them. Would the average teenager be more apt to recognize Cristiano Ronaldo than Mike Trout? Yes. Thing is, Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't yet graced an MLS team. He might do a brief drop-in before he retires, but that remains the knock on MLS: The biggest names only come when they're in decline, and then not for long. (Zlatan Ibrahimovic came and went in the time it takes to say "Zlatan Ibrahimovic.")
Say what you will about MLB -- over the past month, we've said nothing complimentary -- but it's where the best baseball is played. At the same MLS kickoff event where Berg made his pronouncement, Jorge Mas, co-owner of expansion club Inter Miami, made another. "I think (that MLS in 2045) will be on par or exceed the best leagues in the world, the Premier League or Serie A or La Liga worldwide. I think that the MLS 25 years from now will be Premier League-ish if we want to call it that on the metrics that leagues are measured by."
We check metrics from the here and now. The English Premier League's TV deal for this season is worth $2.14 billion; the MLS deal is $90 million. FiveThirtyEight attempts to rank the world's soccer clubs: The first-named MLS team is LAFC at 133rd; the second was Atlanta United at 220th.
MLS has done well. Its footprint keeps growing. It will, however, be difficult to claim superiority over MLB when MLS isn't the best soccer product available on U.S.TV. No, watching the Premier League on Saturday mornings isn't the same as standing in Mercedes-Benz Stadium and doing the songs/ chants, and the embrace of soccer in this city has been startling. But we are -- stop me if you've heard this already -- a trendy sports city. There once was a time, we note, when the Hawks were a hot ticket.
A major part of the MLS pitch is to millennials -- upwardly mobile young adults who (major generalizations coming) work in tech and take Uber everywhere and live downtown. We've yet to see what will happen when those young adults have children. Do they move to the suburbs? Do buy a car? Do they still follow a soccer team?
This isn't to suggest MLB is unassailable. It keeps trying to appeal to a younger audience, but the game itself has become ponderous. (Everything's a home run, a strikeout or a walk.) Folks have stopped watching the World Series in large measure because MLB can't figure out how to market four hours of tedium. Were this simply a test of executive brainpower, MLS would win by a mile.
Baseball, however, had a century's head start. For all its warts, it remains a mighty force. It gets going in the spring, and it's a daily/nightly presence for six months. Maybe it will be different someday, but not anytime soon. And before you say, "Soccer appeals to the young, which means it should own the internet and social media," we refer again to the Times story. Wrote Juliette Love: "The Rockies aren't as popular across the country, but they get more (Google) searches in Colorado than the NFL's Broncos do."
Growth in sports, or the lack thereof, can be a funny thing. The NBA was circling the drain -- NBA Finals games were airing on late-night tape delay -- until Magic Johnson and Larry Bird showed up. NASCAR sought to get big by going wide and wound up getting smaller. As much as we try to predict the future, we never quite get it right.
If everything broke right for MLS -- if somebody threw $2.14 billion in TV money at the league and such money was used to lure Neymar, Eden Hazard and Virgil van Dijk here tomorrow -- maybe that dream of being No. 3 to the NFL/NBA in 2030 could become a reality. But who'd pay $2.14 billion for broadcast rights to a league that saw its latest MLS Cup final draw 823,000 viewers on ABC? Game 7 of the World Series, played two weeks earlier, drew 23 million on Fox.
Soccer is my favorite sport to watch. (Seriously.) I wish MLS nothing but the best, and I can imagine better days and decades ahead. Can I envision MLS being, by any rational metric, bigger than baseball 10 years hence? No, I can't.

Texto completo: DOHA, Qatar -- The agreement just signed by American and Taliban negotiators opens the way for direct negotiations between the insurgents and other Afghans, including the country's government, on a political future after the United States ends its military presence. The negotiations could also result in a cease-fire.
Here are the main points in the agreement, and a look at how events could unfold.
A gradual U.S. troop withdrawal will begin.
The United States has agreed to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan in exchange for assurances by the Taliban that it will deny sanctuary to terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.
Right now, the United States has about 12,000 troops in the country, down from about 100,000 at the peak of the war nearly a decade ago. They are supported by several thousand others from NATO allies.
The two sides have agreed to a gradual, conditions-based withdrawal over 14 months. In the first phase, about 5,000 troops are to leave within 135 days. During the gradual withdrawal, the Taliban and the Afghan government would have to work out a more concrete power-sharing settlement. That time frame would give the government the cover of American military protection while negotiating.
The Taliban pledged to block terrorist groups.
The United States invaded Afghanistan because the Taliban government had given safe haven to Al Qaeda, which conducted the Sep. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Over the years, even as Al Qaeda has been decimated by years of U.S. military operations, the Taliban refused to publicly disavow the group, which still pledges allegiance to the Taliban's supreme leader. As part of the deal, the Taliban commit to keeping Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups from using Afghan territory to stage attacks against the United States and its allies.
One fact that the agreement sidesteps: A dominant faction within the Taliban, the Haqqani Network, is still classified as a terrorist group by the United States, having carried out dozens of deadly suicide bombings. The leader of the network, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the Taliban's deputy leader and operational commander.
The United States and the Taliban are to establish a joint monitoring body in Qatar, where their negotiations have been held, to assess progress on the commitments.
The United States also committed to working to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners held by the Afghan government and 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces held by the Taliban side by March 10, before both sides are expected to sit down for direct negotiations. The United States will also review sanctions it has on Taliban members and start diplomatic efforts with the United Nations to remove the penalties.
Complicated talks between Afghans come next.
The agreement between the United States and the Taliban unlocks a difficult but crucial next step: negotiations between the Taliban and other Afghans, including the government, over future power-sharing. Those talks are expected to start soon, within 10 days or so.
But the Taliban, who led most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 before they were toppled by the U.S. military invasion, refuse to recognize Afghanistan's democratic government. The goal of their insurgency has been returning to power and establishing rule based on their view of Islam.
Other major issues, including women's rights and civil liberties, are also at stake. Many Afghan women have expressed concern that they have been sidelined from the process, and they fear that protections created for them over the past 18 years could be bargained away to the ultraconservative Taliban movement.
Divisions inside Afghanistan will complicate the negotiations. The democratic side has been bitterly divided by a disputed election, with the main challenger declaring he would form his own government after President Ashraf Ghani won a second term in office.
The deal is tied to reducing bloodshed immediately.
For much of the negotiating process, the American side demanded a cease-fire that could pause the bloodshed, in which dozens are killed daily, and create space for talks over the future of the country. With violence as their main leverage, the Taliban refused that demand in the early stages of the talks, saying they were willing to discuss it only in negotiations with other Afghans once the United States promised to withdraw its troops.
Eventually, the two sides found a compromise: a significant "reduction in violence" that would not be called a cease-fire. The signing of the deal was conditioned on a seven-day test of that violence reduction, which officials said largely worked. Attacks across Afghanistan, which normally would number as many as 50 to 80 on any given day, dropped to below a dozen.
The reduction in violence is expected to continue into the next phase of the process, until the two Afghan sides can agree to a more comprehensive cease-fire.

To Take On the Coronavirus, Go Medieval on It

Texto completo: Quarantines and restrictive measures served a purpose in the old days. They can now, too.
There are two ways to fight epidemics: the medieval and the modern.
The modern way is to surrender to the power of the pathogens: Acknowledge that they are unstoppable and to try to soften the blow with 20th-century inventions, including new vaccines, antibiotics, hospital ventilators and thermal cameras searching for people with fevers.
The medieval way, inherited from the era of the Black Death, is brutal: Close the borders, quarantine the ships, pen terrified citizens up inside their poisoned cities.
For the first time in more than a century, the world has chosen to confront a new and terrifying virus with the iron fist instead of the latex glove.
At least for a while, it worked, and it might still serve a purpose.
The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, was able to seal off the city of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 outbreak began, because China is a place where a leader can ask himself, "What would Mao do?" and just do it. The bureaucracy will comply, right down to the neighborhood committees that bar anyone returning from Wuhan from entering their own homes, even if it means sleeping in the streets.
The White House, in defiance of recent American history, also opted to go medieval by aggressive measures like barring entry to non-Americans who were recently in China and advising Americans not to go to China or South Korea.
Over the years, states and cities have imposed local quarantines, but there have been no national restrictions on entry since 1892, according to Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian and the author of "Quarantine!"
In that year, President Benjamin Harrison ordered that all ships from Hamburg be kept offshore for 20 days because officials in that city, one of the world's biggest ports, had lied about its cholera epidemic.
It apparently succeeded. The United States had cholera outbreaks in 1832, 1849, 1870 and 1910, but not in 1892.
Many public health figures consider shutting a nation's doors to be an archaic tactic, and nearly impossible in the jet age.
But for Mr. Trump, such a move is natural. He was elected on a Build-the-Wall platform and in 2014, when a few heroic American medical workers got infected fighting Ebola in West Africa, he advocated leaving them there to die. (They were flown back, and survived.)
Also, this virus's speed and apparent lethality gave the experienced doctors in the White House Coronavirus Task Force reason to be nervous. It is spreading between nations very quickly. And, while data is still sketchy, some measurements indicate that its fatality rate might be close to that of the 1918 Spanish flu.
As a result, they endorsed dropping the portcullis and shutting off air links to China.
They even created quarantine stations on military bases, the equivalent of Venice's island lazarettos, where, in the time of the doges, the infected awaited their fate outside the city.
This has led to much consternation among other public health experts, who argue that travel restrictions can cause more panic, misery and death than they prevent. Crowds may besiege hospitals, supercharging the infection rate. Closed borders can cut off vital medications like insulin. Factory and shop closings mean lost wages, hardships and possibly recession.
Also, quarantines feed racism and stigma.
Officially, the World Health Organization opposes travel and trade restrictions. It reiterated that even as it declared the epidemic a global emergency on Jan. 30.
But it now admits that they helped. The head of the W.H.O. team that visited China said this week that China "took one of the most ancient strategies and rolled out one of the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease-containment efforts in history."
The W.H.O.'s epidemic-modeling teams concluded that travel restrictions had slowed the spread of the virus outside China by two to three weeks.
For the United States, the delay was probably far greater. Air-traffic data shows that flights from China to the United States dropped much more than they did to Europe.
As of this writing, a single case not connected to any known transmission has turned up in California, but there are no indications of large outbreaks like those in Italy and Iran.
Harsh measures horrify civil libertarians, but they often save lives, especially when they are imposed in the early days.
The best-known modern example is Cuba's AIDS epidemic. In the 1980s, Cuba and the United States were both hit hard by the AIDS epidemic. In Cuba, the virus first infected thousands of soldiers, doctors and nurses who had served in Africa.
The Castro regime's response -- roundly condemned by other countries -- was to make H.I.V. tests mandatory, and to force everyone infected into quarantine camps. The camps were not hellholes: they had bungalows, gardens, theater troupes, medical care, more food than people outside often had, and less homophobia than gay men often faced in macho rural Cuba. But no one could leave, except for brief family visits with an escort whose main job was to make sure that no sex took place.
Meanwhile, the United States took a pro-legal-rights approach. Even offering an H.I.V. test was made illegal without a separate counseling session, which scared many away from testing. Although gay bathhouses were epicenters of transmission, there were long divisive fights over closing them.
After triple therapy was developed in the mid-1990s, most Cuban camps closed.
But the difference in lives saved by choosing brutality over freedom was stark: Cuba's H.I.V. infection rate was for decades about one-sixth that of the American one. New York City and Cuba have roughly the same population. In the epidemic's first 30 years, fewer than 2,500 Cubans died of AIDS. Over 78,000 New Yorkers -- mostly gay men -- did.
As the virus creeps closer, stark choices will arise. The United States cannot shut out the whole world. Even if all air travel were stopped, the virus could reach Latin America or Canada and enter over our land borders.
With luck, the extra time that China bought us by falling on its viral grenade will help produce a treatment or a vaccine. The threat will subside and reporters like me will be accused of alarmism.
Top American health officials now say "it is not a matter of if but when" the virus begins to spread here. But the American experience will not echo the Chinese one.
China has had imperial rule since 221 B.C. The United States, born of rebellion, prizes individual rights.
There will be no national lockdown. No threats to have anyone "forever nailed to history's pillar of shame," as one of Mr. Xi's underlings warned those who hid cases of infection.
But local control -- and the political factionalism that is endemic to democracy -- can carry grave risks in the face of a crisis, Dr. Markel noted.
In 1918 and 1919, as the Spanish influenza swept across the country in waves, various cities reacted in their own ways.
Cities like St. Louis that reacted quickly -- canceling parades and ballgames, shutting schools, transit systems and government offices, ordering the sick to stay home -- ultimately had fewer deaths.
In cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which were paralyzed by political feuds or pressure from local businesses to avoid shutdowns, many more ultimately died.
To overcome the divisiveness that would imperil a cohesive national response, Dr. Markel said, "you need leadership from the top -- and there has to be trust. In an epidemic, the idea that 'everyone is entitled to their own facts' is really dangerous."

Texto completo: Crowds of migrants headed for border crossings after an appeals court ruled against the Trump administration's "Remain in Mexico" policy for asylum seekers. But their hopes were short-lived.
CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico -- At first, the people at the Good Samaritan migrant shelter who have had few reasons to cheer did precisely that. With news that many of them could soon be on their way to the United States, they applauded and embraced in the outdoor plaza, where sagging clotheslines intrude onto the basketball court.
The adults waited for more details, as their children rode exuberantly around the courtyard in the shelter equivalent of Radio Flyers: milk-crate wagons. Hours later, they got more news: Nothing had changed. The stringent Trump administration border policy that has kept thousands of asylum seekers trapped in Mexico would keep them waiting a while longer.
"I feel overwhelmed right now," said Adela Abigail Castillo de Moreira, an asylum seeker from El Salvador who has been waiting in Ciudad Juárez for a month.
A federal appeals court decision on Friday that could upend the border policy created a chaotic day for thousands of migrants in Mexico's border cities -- at Good Samaritan and other shelters in Ciudad Juárez, at the international bridges and ports of entry in Tijuana and Matamoros.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that the so-called "Remain in Mexico" policy was legally invalid, a ruling that prompted the initial cheering at Good Samaritan. The policy has forced migrants to wait in Mexico for months while their asylum cases are reviewed. Many migrants believed that the ruling meant that the wait was over, and they could cross into the United States, an option that is currently limited to those who are escorted temporarily into the country for brief immigration-court hearings. By the end of the night, the court stayed its ruling. And in the meantime, confusion reigned.
The chaotic, up-again, down-again day was emblematic of the emotional turmoil many migrants are facing on the Mexican border. Hundreds of thousands have fled deep poverty and violence in Central America and other nations over the past two years, only to encounter an escalating series of policies put into place by the Trump administration that have thwarted their attempts to seek asylum in the United States. More than 59,000 migrants have been turned back at the border under the "Remain in Mexico" policy.
Migrants gathered Friday evening at border crossings. Some tried to cross and were turned away. Some stayed put at shelters and tent encampments, debating what to do.
Late in the evening, as the crowds of migrants swelled and a few border bridges were closed, the news that the court's ruling had been temporarily stayed arrived, dimming hopes once more.
In Tijuana, south of the California city of San Diego, more than 50 asylum seekers marched to the port of entry, singing about winning asylum and helping one another carry their luggage. Many held copies of the appeals court's earlier decision in their hands. But the court's stay occurred just as they reached the port. Many had given up their shelter beds and had arrived at the port with all of their belongings, so they waited late into the evening at the closed gates because they had nowhere else to go.
At the Good Samaritan shelter in Ciudad Juárez, Pedro Luis Ruiz Tamayo, 50, did what he has been doing for 10 months: He waited. Mr. Tamayo, who is from Havana, Cuba, had no intention of rushing to a bridge. He said he had been following President Trump's Twitter feed, and since the president had posted nothing about the decision, he figured he would be turned away. His second interview for his asylum case was scheduled for June 16, so his plan was to simply wait until then.
"I tell the other immigrants that they have to be patient, because this is not final," Mr. Tamayo said.
He was one of 110 asylum seekers from nine countries who have been waiting at Good Samaritan. Among them were seven Cubans, 11 Guatemalans, 15 Hondurans, 51 Brazilians. They sleep on bunk beds in dorm rooms and, when Mass is not being held, inside the small church. For Mr. Tamayo and the others, days of uncertainty and legal maneuvering they barely understood were nothing new.
"I came here to ask for asylum to the U.S., not to Mexico," Mr. Tamayo said. "I've never seen, in any part of the world, that you ask for asylum in a country and they send you to a third country."
They ate quietly in the church, by the mats on the floor where they sleep. They spoke of being afraid to venture beyond the shelter at night, because criminals prey on them and their children. They traded messages on WhatsApp with migrants at other shelters. They watched their children bounce a tire attached to a rope on the concrete. They waited.

Destroy the Democratic Party? Sanders might save it

Texto completo: After Bernie Sanders led the popular vote in the Iowa caucuses, the emails started trickling in.
Alarmed Democrats, and excited Republicans, saw in Sanders a ghost that has loomed over the Democratic Party for decades: George McGovern.
McGovern, the 1972 Democratic presidential nominee, suffered a historic defeat that year. He lost every state, save Massachusetts. Richard Nixon was reelected in a landslide.

If the senator from Vermont becomes the Democrats' nominee, my correspondents predict, the party will go down in flames. Trump will enjoy Nixonian reelection numbers, down-ballot Democrats will suffer needless losses and the party will have to rise from the ashes once again.
This, to quote South Carolina's favorite Democratic hopeful, is a bunch of malarkey.
While Sanders and McGovern may be ideological brethren, a potential matchup between Sanders and Trump bears little resemblance to the matchup between McGovern and Nixon.
Here's why:
During Nixon's first term, the American economy was booming -- economic growth was strong, personal income was up. His popularity was high -- about 60%. While McGovern campaigned to end the Vietnam War, Nixon could boast that he had drastically drawn down the number of U.S. troops fighting what had become by then a deeply unpopular conflict. He courted Democrats by vowing to lower taxes for the working class.
McGovern made some consequential mistakes: He chose a running mate, Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, who would later be forced off the ticket after it was disclosed that he had been treated for depression with electroshock therapy. After vowing to support Eagleton "1,000%," McGovern shoved him aside to make room for Peace Corps founder Sargent Shriver, a Kennedy in-law.
Conventional wisdom holds that McGovern was too far left, and that voters specifically rejected his ideology. They then used his defeat to craft self-serving narratives.
"What happened is that critics of progressive policies -- whether economic or social or racial -- picked the ones they were opposed to before McGovern, then pointed to them as the reason for his loss," said the American political historian Joshua Mound, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Virginia.
"In reality," Mound says, when you add up Nixon's positives, "any Democrat was doomed to lose." I spoke to him on Friday morning after reading a 2016 essay he wrote for the New Republic: "What Democrats Still Don't Get About George McGovern." The Democratic Party, wrote Mound, "could have resurrected FDR, and Nixon would have trounced him in 1972."
McGovern's loss drove Democrats to the middle. The Clinton years of "triangulation" and moderation would bring a shift away from the party's principles of standing up for the working class and the oppressed.
Clinton pushed NAFTA amid rosy promises of massive job retraining for the blue-collar workers whose jobs went south. He vowed to end "welfare as we know it," signed the homophobic Defense of Marriage Act, and triangulated his way to the untenable "don't ask, don't tell" policy for the military.
While the Democratic Party may have moved rightward, American sentiment has been drifting left.
"With each passing decade," Mound wrote in the New Republic, "the types of voters drawn to McGovern's 1972 campaign have become a larger and larger share of the American electorate, while the issues championed by McGovern have become more and more salient."
Donald Trump is no Richard Nixon.
He is unpopular and the self-proclaimed steward of an economy that has a shiny exterior (record corporate profits, a heretofore humming stock market and low unemployment) but a rotting core (stagnant wages, skyrocketing costs, pessimism about the future).
The overheated claims that Sanders can't win because he embraces "Medicare for all" and the end of private health insurance, or because he wants public colleges and universities to be tuition-free or because he wants to ban fracking, just don't hold up.
Since 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, most Americans support the concept of Medicare for all; that is, "a national health plan in which Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan."
Most Americans also support tuition-free public college and the forgiving of at least some college debt, which is a terrible drag on the economy and a serious impediment to the financial success of millennials who are saddled with the untenable loans.
As for fracking, even in Pennsylvania voters are deeply ambivalent about the practice although it employs thousands.
Democrats -- like the dozens of freaked-out super-delegates interviewed by the New York Times last week -- who threaten to edge out Sanders if he arrives at the party convention with a mere plurality rather than majority of delegates are making a big mistake.
After all, most polls say that Sanders can beat Trump. Sanders' polling strength undercuts the oft-repeated claim that he can be destroyed because he calls himself a democratic socialist. Besides, if the Republicans haven't already neutered the word "socialist" through overuse, they soon will. Also, when he is given the chance, Sanders makes a perfectly cogent case that he is ideologically in tune with most Americans, whether they realize it or not.
I mean, come on: You will receive, or already are receiving, Social Security and Medicare without complaint, and now you're gonna scream about the evils of socialism?
Unlike Sanders, McGovern was always the underdog in 1972. His ghost may hang over this election, but only because so many Democrats have come to appreciate his progressive ideas.

An N.B.A. Veteran Tops The Western Conference And the Music Charts

Texto completo: JaVale McGee has two N.B.A. championships to his name. Now, as a budding music producer, he also has a credit on a Bieber hit.
LOS ANGELES -- The speakers in the Lakers' weight room have been blasting "Available," a song off Justin Bieber's newest album, "Changes."
The song is the work of the team's center, JaVale McGee. Yes, he's the one that grabbed the auxiliary cord to play the song. He's also the only one on the team who can take credit for producing it.
Between his day job and his side hustle, McGee has achieved a rare feat: He's a contributor to the No. 1 album in the country and to the top-seeded team in the N.B.A.'s Western Conference.
McGee, 32, has been making music since he was a freshman at the University of Nevada. The self-described technology nerd started making beats on his computer as soon as he realized he could do so.
As he bounced around to different pro teams over his 12-year N.B.A. career -- playing for the Washington Wizards, Denver Nuggets, Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors -- he honed his music production skills during his downtime. N.B.A. road trips also gave him the opportunity to network. He met more seasoned producers when he traveled to Los Angeles, and had a fateful meeting in 2013 with Jason Boyd, better known as Poo Bear, one of Bieber's longtime collaborators.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
McGee released his first album in 2018, under the pseudonym Pierre, an alter ego that had been a source of mockery by sports fans. That year, he also won the second of his two championships with the Golden State Warriors before being courted to join the Lakers.
The New York Times sat down with McGee to discuss his music career, working on "Available" alongside trusted Bieber producers Poo Bear and HARV, and why most of his teammates may not know he's on the Billboard charts.
This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.
How did you start to develop as a producer?
I started in 2008, and I wasn't really good. I didn't understand that you have to get different sounds from different producers. I didn't understand the intricacies of building relationships and producing. I thought you just make a beat and give it to the artists. But it's not like that at all.
I really figured out it's more about relationships rather than just making a million beats and hoping somebody picks it up. I have some good friends in the music industry and they would show me stuff. They would just teach me. You need this, buy this app, you need this right here. Just helping me get my producing right.
How do you find that balance, then, between being a professional basketball player and producer of Bieber bops?
I balance it by being a producer. I could rap if I wanted to, but I don't think I would have time. It would take too much time away from basketball. As a producer, everything I have to do is right on my computer. I don't have to actually go to the studio.
I tend to do studio sessions early because studio sessions can be extremely long. So I've learned not to start a studio session at 11 p.m. There are certain things that restrict me from being the best producer I could be because I have to go to sleep, but I make it work.
When did you sit down and create what we now know as " Available ?"
I was in the studio with Poo Bear around November of last year. I didn't know who I was making music for. I was playing some songs and samples and he stopped on this one sample that I had made. He looped it, put it in the computer and we just started writing to it. We ended up writing the whole song, but there were no drums or anything.
The original melody, when you hear it in the beginning of a song? That's what I brought to the table.
And how did you find out that your work was going to be on Justin Bieber's album?
Three months later, Poo Bear calls me, and we were talking about the fact that both of our houses had been broken into. We ended that conversation and he said, 'Oh yeah, you're on the album.' I'm like, 'What album?'
It was amazing. Justin Bieber is one of the, if not the, top artists out there. So to be able to keep working and produce something for an artist like that is amazing. And ... I'm a basketball player.
You occasionally use the pseudonym "Pierre" for your music. Have you tried to keep your music production and basketball careers separate?
I sort of like having anonymity. I like to separate things. When I'm focused on something I tend to keep my focus on that.
But it's a give and take. Originally, I didn't want to be known as the basketball player who produces music, but now I'm embracing it a lot more. Being on the Lakers, of course you get a lot of eyes on you. So I'm trying to take advantage of that.
How did your team react to the news?
I really haven't told anybody yet. I think I might send it in a group text. People who don't know or aren't in that circle are definitely going to be all: 'Oh, that's crazy. You produced a Bieber track? That doesn't make sense.'
My teammates will say 'aw man, that's cool' and then get over it. There's just so much going on.

Texto completo: Re "Protected cactuses felled to construct border wall," Feb. 27
The news of the taking down of protected saguaro cacti in Arizona for the ultimately ineffective U.S.-Mexico border fence (it's not a wall) touted by President Trump is particularly disheartening.
It brings to mind last year during the government shutdown (largely over the same stupid idea -- a wall) when marauders damaged trees at our beloved Joshua Tree National Park.

When will we demand that our leaders learn important lessons? People, we have Tuesday, and we have Nov. 3. Vote for the natural environment like your life depends on it, because it does.
Scott Hamre
Cherry Valley, Calif.
::
Just who does President Trump think he is with the construction of his border wall, which has still not been approved by Congress, causing the destruction of mighty saguaro plants in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument?
The destruction of any organ pipe cactus, which is protected, is a crime. Trump, who wrote and signed the orders to build the wall, should face the same punishment that you and I would if we were to destroy these specimens.
I travel through the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument often when visiting Mexico, and the namesake cacti are a sight to behold. It takes about 100 years for one to grow an arm.
I doubt Trump has ever been in the park, let alone seen one of these cacti up close.

What hath Bernie wrought?
Re "Young voters go all-in for Sanders," Feb. 27
We would not be in the constitutional and political mess we are in today if not for Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 because of then-FBI Director James B. Comey and her former primary opponent Sanders, not because she didn't visit a few states that President Trump ended up winning. What is a mystery to me is why the media or any of his opponents have not attacked him on his past record in this regard.
His Senate designation is as an independent, not as a Democrat. He has proven to be an uncooperative team player.
It is important that the Democrats cohere around the nominee, yet Sanders might just pull out the same playbook he did back in 2016 if he doesn't get the nomination.
We do not need another backward-looking runaway ego sitting in the White House.
Nancy Zaman
Beverly Hills
::
Apparently, we are supposed to be worried that nominating Sanders will mean certain defeat by Trump. And, to avoid this, we are supposed to vote for any moderate Democrat who might have the chance of defeating him in California.
But wait, didn't the Democratic Party nominate a moderate in 2016?
Maybe, just maybe, the Democratic Party should support the candidate that is generating the largest grass-roots support among committed activists who are working day and night on his campaign. Maybe, just maybe, if the Democratic Party were to support the candidate that is talking about the economic issues facing the vast majority of Americans, we could easily defeat that alleged populist Trump.
Just think: We could overwhelmingly win the election. Or we could just support anyone but Sanders and get four more years of Trump.
By the way, we are not millennials. We are in our 60s and are working tirelessly to ensure a Sanders victory and a Green New Deal in California.

::
Sanders promises to spend $2.5 trillion on housing over the next 10 years. He promises aid to homeless people and construction of new housing, among other things.
This is in addition to free college and free medical care. Whoopie.
I am 85 years old. Sanders is 78. Neither of us will be around much longer, but young voters will still be paying for this "free stuff" when they are our age.

Why school measures fail
Re "Audit: Lottery owes millions to state schools," Feb. 26
According to the state auditor, the California Lottery has been holding back funding from public schools, including $36 million in 2018. Last year, the Los Angeles Unified School District asked voters to pass a parcel tax to cover its increased expenses. That initiative failed, so the district is devising another funding measure that it hopes voters will approve.
Taxpayers and lottery players have often wondered why the school system always needs more money when the people of this state are spending hundreds of millions of dollars playing the lottery knowing that a percentage of these funds will go to schools.
If our schools really need the additional funding, which I believe they do, they should draft a proposal to increase their proportion of lottery revenue. Don't try to ask the taxpayers for more money -- it won't work.
In addition, maybe the school districts need to collectively hire an outside accounting agency to watch over the funding and ensure that our students are receiving what they are legally due.

::
In 1984, I voted yes on the ballot measure to create the California Lottery. I thought it was a great idea to set aside 34% of the sales revenue for schools, creating a steady stream of income that we would not have to vote on again and again.
Capping administrative expenses at 16% was a sound decision.
Now, I am appalled to read that in 2010, the state Legislature took it upon itself to change how the California Lottery determined its obligation to schools. How can lawmakers arbitrarily change a ballot measure that took a statewide vote to pass?
Now, we are being asked to pass Proposition 13 because our schools need more money. I say vote no on this.
Your article states that the lottery has provided $6.7 billion to public education over the last four years. What happened to all that money?

A fall guy for coronavirus
Re "The politics of coronavirus," Feb. 28
Sure, naming Vice President Mike Pence, a science-disdaining evangelical Christian, to coordinate our country's response to the looming coronavirus epidemic may seem like yet another inapt Trumpian appointment. But giving Pence something to do might turn out to be a win-win for Trump.
If the virus' spread somehow is thwarted under Pence's direction, Trump can cite this stunning success all the way to election day. If an epidemic ensues, Trump can tell Pence he's fired and replace him with a more appealing running mate.
Waiting in the wings for such an exigency is Nikki Haley; as a former ambassador to the United Nations, state legislator and governor, she's compiled a sterling resume. With Haley on the ticket, Trump can hope to draw in millions of women who otherwise would vote for a mixed-gender Democratic ticket.
Democrats have every reason to pray that Pence doesn't falter in his epidemic-fighting role.
Edward Alston

::
The president, in order to manage the spin on the COVID-19 virus and make sure to maintain the very best of images, has decided that any medical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meant for American citizens must first get the blessing of the vice president, who has no medical training.
There's a name for this kind of governance -- it's called "dictatorship."

The president's handling of the coronavirus reminds me of how the Soviet Union handled the Chernobyl crisis. We all remember how that turned out.

Media filters
Re "YouTube and conservatives," editorial, Feb. 27
I agree that conservative ideas have practically no place in public discourse unless screened by responsible progressive media.
The Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN and NBC have done a great job filtering those ideas to mitigate against their nefarious influence on the populace. Keep up the good work.

Capital Punisher
I work at a nonprofit, where we are passionate about our jobs. Execs recently hired a new head of human resources. Her first act: Change the department's name from "H.R." to "Human Capital"! Cool if we were Goldman Sachs, but a mission-oriented nonprofit? Capital? How do I broach the topic with the C.E.O. that this does not respect the staff? She was clearly on board when the change was implemented, but may be open to realizing it is not being well received.
-- Anonymous
Unless the mission of your nonprofit relates to the historical preservation of corporate jargon, do not bother your C.E.O. with this.
Many people hear the phrase "human resources" and assume it refers to a collection of resources provided for the humans who work at a company. The company, by this reckoning, is a kind of Mother Gaia who provides her children not with wind and petroleum but payroll information and a mechanism for reporting sexual harassment. Incorrect. Human resources, as defined in both the dictionaries of our land, and in the hearts of its C-suite executives, are that portion of a company's exploitable resources that are human, as opposed to, say, financial. Humans are the resources of "human resources." We are the plankton slowly pressure-cooked over millions of years into black sludge capable of powering company vehicles.
Put that way, "human resources" doesn't sound so different from "human capital." Or does it? What is human capital?
No one knows. People who act like they know actually just want to hear themselves say "human capital." I'm sure I'll be hearing from some of them. It is an act of charity for me to give them an opportunity to use the phrase they love, and they are welcome. The different meanings individuals and organizations ascribe to this term are so nebulous as to be essentially incomprehensible. Economists roughly define it as every little thing about you that facilitates your making money. Modern H.R. departments increasingly use it as a prestigious euphemism for H.R. See also: "People Operations"; "Talent & Inclusion."
Protesting this meaningless corporate designation will not improve your life, and could earn you the reputation of someone who wastes time complaining about inconsequential details. If this manager goes on to create policies that are truly unacceptable (policies that, as you point out, would arrive with inherent C.E.O. approval), you will be glad you didn't waste your first objection on a quibble about naming.
There is one person with whom you might broach the subject: your new head of Human Capital. Say you'd like to learn more about what aspects of career development the reorganized department is intended to emphasize. This is, of course, a lie, but I guarantee the person who instituted this change has sensational ideas about why it was necessary, and will relish the opportunity to list them to a new audience. You can earn points by seeming to care.
Shall We Pivot to Video?
I started a new job a few months ago at a media company, and it's horrible. The management runs on power trips, my boss's expectations are vague at best and impossible at worst, and everyone hates their job. The whole place has a cursed and doomed energy, and I'm already applying to new jobs to get out. That said, it has benefits and good vacation days.
An acquaintance recently asked me for advice for applying to my exact job. (A co-worker got fired suddenly.) I gave her some interview tips, but also told her to check out the (damning) Glassdoor reviews. She's making her way through the interview process and is very qualified. What is my moral responsibility to tell her how bad it really is? Her options seem to be this job or unemployment, which is how I got here, too.
-- Anonymous
If you don't lie, you can't get caught in a lie. Tell her whatever you want, as long as it's not a lie. I don't think your moral responsibility toward "an acquaintance" is tremendous, but even if she were a close friend, it would not be your duty to talk her out of taking a legal, nonhazardous job -- especially if it were her only option.
Your mention of a media job with "good vacation days" for entry-level employees caught my eye. I hope yours is one. I'm also aware of the common practice, particularly among start-ups, of offering so-called unlimited vacation. Perhaps for some the policy works as advertised; in my experience, its effect is that employees end up taking relatively little time off, for fear of looking greedy or undedicated. I can attest that I took more vacation in years when my time off was finite than when it was styled "unlimited." (That's not unusual; some companies with unlimited vacation set a recommended minimum of vacation days to counter this.) Whatever your company's policy, make sure you do avail yourself of paid time off, especially since it sounds like your job makes you miserable.
I also think many of my acquaintances who work in media would describe their workplaces with similar language -- but don't let that dissuade you from leaving.
Get a Load of His Compliments
When I was a teacher at a boarding school, we had an athletic director who liked to call students and faculty "tiger" or "handsome." He always felt that if he could say something nice to someone, he would do it, as that may be the only nice thing that person heard that day. He passed away a few years ago. As a nice memory and in admiration for his kind agenda, I like to call people handsome also.
A supervisor today -- who I CC'ed on an email in which I called someone handsome -- wrote an email back. I was told to "refrain from calling people handsome." I'm curious. What is wrong with the salutation? I'm clueless how this may be a bad thing.
-- David
It's a lovely notion to compliment when the opportunity presents itself. Flattery of physical traits (regardless of kindness-to-accuracy ratio) could be welcome; it could also leave a person feeling uncomfortably scrutinized.
In any instance when a teacher is addressing a student, at work and when you simply can't know for sure, highlight a specific skill or accomplishment instead. Besides being unfailingly appropriate, this is more in keeping with your generous intent. A salutation -- generic by design -- should not even be eligible to count as the only nice thing a person hears all day. Praise for something someone did, even if it's as simple as "You did a great job with [X]," gives the recipient the impression he or she is appreciated, rather than merely observed.

Claudia Rankine Flies the Unfriendly Skies

Texto completo: How do you turn a magazine article about air travel and race relations into theater? For "Help," Rankine's new play, she started with a pile of letters.
I was enchanted by Claudia Rankine's smile.
Even though this was our second interview together (the first was by phone), and we have several friends in common, I was still surprised by her welcoming hug and warmth when we met at a conference room in the Shed three weeks before the world premiere of her play "Help" there on March 10. Forty minutes later, I realized that after years of teaching her poetry, especially "Citizen," her book-length poem on American race relations, my mind somehow had constructed Rankine as reserved, scolding and confrontational.
I left our conversation even more out of sorts as I asked myself: "If I, as a black woman, could so easily misread Claudia Rankine, what hope is there for any white man not to do the same?"
This dilemma -- between the racial and gender stereotypes that our society projects onto black women and how they have to reject those roles in order to assert their own identities -- is the central conflict of "Help." Commissioned by the Shed, New York City's new $ 475 million arts center that is now in its second season at Hudson Yards, the play is partly based on Rankine's New York Times Magazine article from last July, "I Wanted to Know What White Men Thought About Their Privilege. So I Asked."
In that essay, Rankine described her repeated experiences being rendered invisible by white men as they waited in first-class lines together at the airport, and her attempts to ask other white men sitting next to her in the intimate and elite space of the airplane cabin how they perceive their own white privilege. "I wondered, what is this 'stuckness' inside racial hierarchies that refuses the neutrality of the skies?" she wrote. "I hoped to find a way to have this conversation."
Rankine explained why she chose the transitory setting of air travel. "It was the only time where I found myself sort of thrown in intimacy, if I wanted it, with random white men who were, just through proximity, there," she said in our interview. "Sometimes you're on these long flights, you're exhausted, and you've done whatever you were going to do or you're on your way to do it. And people are willing to just sort of launch, partly to let the time pass and partly because you're drinking a lot. Both things are happening at the same time."
In response to the piece, Rankine received over 2,000 comments on the Times website and more than 200 letters or emails sent to her at Yale University. White men who wanted to engage in the debate or explain why they took offense to her characterizations made up the majority of the correspondence.
"There are these letters that are three pages in which somebody sat down and wrote, 'Dear Professor Rankine' or 'Dear Claudia Rankine,' This is my life. This is what you're not thinking about," she said. "As I read through most of them, I realized that I'm talking about privilege as a way of being, period. The ability to live, the ability to be alive in the world. And they're talking about privilege as making money. I hadn't really understood that disconnect until I actually parsed all of those letters."
She went on, "It made me go back and think about what felt so offensive about 'All Lives Matter.' White people start with that as a given. And because they're white, they don't understand that black people are starting with, 'Will my life matter? Can my life matter? Does my life matter?' And so that step backward into nonbeing is not one they've had to take."
"So they don't understand why you're addressing it," she concluded. "I don't think it's willful aggression. I think it is symptomatic of whiteness in and of itself, that they don't have to think about it, so they don't think about it, and they think you're being presumptuous by asking them about their lives."
With "Help," unlike her plays that were first conceived for performance -- "The Provenance of Beauty" at the Foundry in 2009, and American Repertory Theater's "The White Card" in 2018 -- Rankine had taken on the task of dramatizing an already well-circulated essay.
To do so, she reinvented herself as the Narrator, a middle-aged black air traveler played by Roslyn Ruff ("Fairview"), and created 20 white male characters who are on the plane with her. Rankine said that "90 percent of what is spoken by the white men in the script" is taken from the letters she received.
She drew the rest of the script from interviews and an assortment of writings and statements by the black feminist theorists Hortense Spillers and Saidiya Hartman, the Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the civil rights activist Ruby Sales and President Trump, as well as a video of police diversity training in Plainfield, Ind.
It then fell on Rankine, and a diverse artistic team led by the director Taibi Magar, to turn that prose into a full-fledged theater experience. Or, as Magar suggested to me in an interview, something else entirely.
"Sometimes I come home from rehearsal and I'm like, 'Is it theater?' I'm not even sure," Magar said. "'Is it performance art?' Sometimes she's creating a poem onstage, sometimes we're referencing a lot of stand-up. What has been exciting for me to embrace is that its form does not feel traditional."
She continued, "This is important to me in plays about confronting racism. We really have to shake up our narratives in order to see a black woman's reality."
At the Tuesday afternoon rehearsal I attended, I caught a glimpse of what Magar meant. In a scene choreographed by Shamel Pitts, as the white male actors frenetically danced around an empty airline seat meant for the Narrator with movements that referenced everything from gyrated hips to Hitler salutes, it felt a bit like a vaudeville flash mob. And because both Rankine and Ruff were out at a photo shoot, I was one of two black women in the room, heightening my sense of being overtaken by the actors' whiteness and maleness.
In many ways, that is the point. Recent productions like "Slave Play," "Fairview" and "Toni Stone" have all explicitly taken on the white gaze. By doing so, they risked reproducing the very racial hierarchy in the audience that they sought to criticize onstage.
When I asked Magar if she was worried about focusing on whiteness at the expense of the Narrator or the black people in the theater, she said, "We're not centering whiteness in the ways that it's centered in our culture. Whiteness is the problem, and whites are the ones who need to fix themselves. So you sort of need to center them."
Before leaving, however, Magar reminded me that the play ultimately revolves around Rankine's character, and that Magar and Ruff worked hard to always remind the audience that a black woman lies at the center of this work. In one scene, a white man steps in front of the Narrator without excusing himself or acknowledging her. By having Ruff stand next to her empty space in the line, her character's invisibility is rendered hypervisible for the audience.
Ruff admitted that at first she was hesitant to accept the part of the Narrator, the sole black woman among so many white men.
"After having an intense two years with 'Fairview,' I really had to have a conversation with myself about taking on this narrative, subject matter, and this theme again," she said, "because sometimes it can just be a bit much."
Ruff noted that she can't just switch off the story when she leaves the Shed.
"I am navigating that world as myself on a day-to-day basis," she said. "This 'work' is my life, my personal life, when I go home, turn on the television, watch CNN or MSNBC, and deal with the climate that we're in right now."
Ruff also recognized that much of what Rankine wanted in her essay -- an honest interracial conversation about white male privilege -- has already taken place among the cast and crew as they prepare for opening night. In the beginning, Ruff said, some of her castmates would offer "a defense" of one of the white men's comments in the script, derived from the letters to Rankine.
"That was fascinating," she said, and sometimes led to "a reflective moment. An 'OK. Wait a minute.' And a real realization that in their defensiveness, that, too, is privilege at work."

What's on TV
DISPATCHES FROM ELSEWHERE 10 p.m. on AMC. Fans of elaborate scavenger hunts would get a kick of out this new anthology series. The idea came to Jason Segel, the show's creator and star, after he discovered an art project and immersive game that drew more than 7,000 people in San Francisco and Oakland from 2008 to 2011. He adapted it for the screen and plays one of four characters (along with Sally Field, André Benjamin and Eve Lindley) who are brought together by what is, at the outset, to some a practical joke and to others a global conspiracy. There's an element of growth here: Along the way, the journey helps participants overcome inner battles. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Segel said the show celebrates regular people. "A lot of stories are about someone finding out that they're extraordinary," he said. "And this whole thing, it's this idea that we can all be ordinary together and that it's beautiful."
AXIOS 6 p.m. on HBO. This limited documentary series -- a treat for news junkies -- returns for a third run. Journalists from the news outlet Axios interview high-profile subjects in the fields of business, politics and technology. Among those who have sat in the hot seat are President Trump, Senator Kamala Harris and Bill Gates.
DOCTOR WHO 8 p.m. on BBC America. In last week's episode, the Cyber war raged on as the revelation of a portal presented another game-changing mystery. In this episode, the second part of this science fiction series' season finale, Graham (Bradley Walsh), Ryan (Tosin Cole) and Yaz (Mandip Gill) cling to survival, while the Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) seeks much-needed answers. The show has a long history, and it isn't over yet: Whittaker and the showrunner Chris Chibnall will return for another season.
BAR RESCUE 10 p.m. on Paramount. Who doesn't love a good makeover story? There's plenty in this reality show, back for a seventh season, in which the host and night life expert Jon Taffer helps bar owners breathe new life into their failing businesses.
What's Streaming
THE DESCENT (2006) Stream on Amazon, Hulu and Vudu; Rent on Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. It's the first of the month, and that means a new batch of movies has landed on streaming platforms. One, "The Descent," is a nail-biter of a thriller from the British director Neil Marshall ("Hellboy"). The movie opens with a tragedy, which lays down an emotional back story between two friends, Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) and Juno (Natalie Mendoza). A year later, they and four other women take a trip to the Appalachian Mountains to explore a cave. The true terror starts when they become trapped, forced to descend further into the earth while humanoid creatures lurk in the darkness. If the ending leaves you wanting more, the sequel, "The Descent: Part 2," is also available to stream on Amazon and Hulu.

Texto completo: As a reporter covering Texas, I ate, worked and slept in my trusty, company-issued Chevy. So allow me a moment to observe the end of its road.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.

HOUSTON -- In five years and eight months, I put 128,000 miles on my car. I have covered Texas for The New York Times for more than eight years. That means my car -- a 2014 Chevrolet Malibu four-door sedan -- covered Texas, too.
I blew out the tires one night in downtown El Paso after driving over a piece of metal I didn't see until too late. A deer's antlers scraped the passenger-side windows like fingernails on a chalkboard as I nicked the animal on a Hill Country road near Austin. A pebble that blew off a speeding truck gave the windshield a hairline fracture. After the mass shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Galveston, I raced there from Houston. But there was a problem with the ignition and the car refused to shut off, so I left it running on the side of the road while I scrambled to interview witnesses near the scene.
Say a prayer, dear reader, for the vehicles behind the bylines and datelines at The Times. The dispatch from the scene of the explosion or tornado or wildfire or insert-mayhem-here was brought to you by Times journalists and their cars.
Sometimes we're riding in Ubers or cabs or rental cars from the airport, but we're often in one of the vehicles that the newspaper supplies to domestic correspondents, like my Chevy Malibu.
I call it my car, but it's really a Times car, managed and maintained by a fleet management company. I drove a different car when I first started covering Texas in 2011. A few years later in 2014, I got the Malibu, and it had been my trusty, dirty, unheralded and exhausted companion ever since.
Texas is so massive, catastrophe-prone and story-rich that covering it adequately requires not only wheels or wings but also a mobile office. The Malibu was mine. A power inverter plugged into the cigarette lighter turned the passenger seat into a cubicle: I could sit and work on my laptop while the car idled and charged the computer. The distance from Houston to El Paso, which I've traveled a few times in the Malibu, is 747 miles, the equivalent of driving on a multi-state road trip from Times Square to Plainfield, Ind. It's best, in other words, to get comfortable, because the road is long, and the state is, too.
I slept in the Malibu, ate in it, did interviews in it, filed stories on my laptop in it. It had at least two emergency car-wash interventions, one by my in-laws and the other by a visiting editor. One Saturday in 2016, the news broke that Justice Antonin Scalia had died suddenly on a West Texas ranch as I was driving my wife and two children from a funeral in Austin. I pulled over, switched places with my wife and did phone interviews from the passenger side as the Malibu sped back to Houston, while my son and daughter kicked the back of the seat.
Last year, I almost lost the Malibu covering Tropical Depression Imelda in Chambers County, foolishly driving too far into floodwaters. I remember looking down and seeing waves of brown water around me, as if the low-slung Malibu had suddenly been dropped into a rural ocean. It took days for the USB port in the armrest to work again.
I don't know who got to know the Malibu better -- me, or the employees down at the Firestone Complete Auto Care on Kirby Drive in Houston, my go-to repair shop. I flipped through some of the old receipts the other day. Journalistically and automotivally speaking, the receipts were a kind of story behind the story.
In early 2015, after covering the end of the Rick Perry era of state government in Austin and the "American Sniper" murder trial in Stephenville, Tex., the Malibu had 7,679 miles. By mid-2016, after I headed to the East Texas town of Mineola to explore the far-right fringe and later drove to Big Bend National Park to watch it go up in controlled flames, the mileage, Firestone noted, was 28,893.
A couple of weeks ago, the digital odometer read 127,948 miles as I parked the Malibu at a Ford dealership in Houston. It was time to say goodbye. I was getting a new Times car, a sleek black 2020 Ford Fusion. Once the Malibu had hit the 100,000-mile mark, its days as a reporter's vehicle were numbered, I suppose. There was a flurry of activity: signing papers, exchanging keys, carrying my crate of hurricane supplies from the trunk of the old car to the new one. I looked at the lit-up dashboard on the Fusion. The mileage was 4.8.
I'm going to be leaving Houston later this year and moving to Los Angeles, to cover California for The Times. The Fusion will most likely stay behind in Houston, and become the Malibu for another correspondent.
Before I drove away from the dealership, I took a last look at the Malibu, its trunk still open. I couldn't help but think of that scene in "The Blues Brothers," when Elwood's battered, beloved former police car finally collapses at the end, and Elwood takes off his hat, in quiet tribute. I know your blues, Elwood. I know your blues.

Texto completo: The Times's Culture editor has questions. Our critic has answers.
As the editor of the Culture department at The New York Times, Gilbert Cruz relies on critics, reporters and editors in every field of the arts for their expertise. In a new series, we're bringing his questions -- and our writers' answers -- to you. First up: his brief exchange with the co-chief film critic Manohla Dargis following the big wins for "Parasite" at the Oscars.
Gilbert asks: Manohla, I've seen "Parasite" and several other Bong Joon Ho movies. But I want to dig deeper into South Korean cinema. A little help?
Manohla answers: Where to begin?!
South Korean cinema has rocketed to international prominence over the past few decades, as have some of its greatest filmmakers, including Bong. If you loved "Parasite" but haven't seen any of his previous six features, I envy you -- you have hours of pleasure awaiting you. And while I'm not partial to his first feature, the satire "Barking Dogs Never Bite," everything that this sui generis filmmaker has made since is a must-see, from his unsettling monster movie "The Host" to the equally unnerving "Mother," a tale of monstrous motherhood.
Film festivals can be a terrific way to check out the latest in new South Korean cinema, especially given that not everything hits streaming (in English). If you're interested in seeing work from women, sometimes your local festival, museum or cultural center might be your best bet, simply because those movies may not be otherwise available. Among the titles from women making the festival rounds is "The House of Us"; in the March issue of "Sight and Sound," Bong singled out its director, Yoon Ga-eun, as a filmmaker to watch. (Bong also gave a shout out to Kim Ki-young, whose feverish 1960 "The Housemaid" is essential viewing.)

As with any robust national cinema, there is a wide range of work for every taste and temperament, mood and occasion. There are horror freakouts, action adventures, chin-stroking dramas, goofball comedies, tear-soaked melodramas, rarefied art films and down-and-dirty exploitation flicks. The veteran auteur Im Kwon-taek has made more than 100 movies and deserves a deep dive. On the other end of the cine-spectrum, I recommend Yeon Sang-ho's "Train to Busan," a pulse-pounder that focuses on an inattentive businessman and his young daughter who become trapped on a train of fast-moving chomping zombies. It's a tough, surprisingly emotional ride.
Given the sheer bounty of South Korean cinema, I can only point to a selection of favorite artists, among them the brilliant Lee Chang-dong, who deserves a far larger audience in the United States. He's best known here for his unsettling, shrewdly class-conscious drama "Burning," which centers on an uneasy triangle -- featuring a revelatory turn from the American actor Steven Yeun -- that ends in catastrophe. Two other essential Lee movies to check out are "Poetry," about a woman who comes to realize that her grandson has committed a ghastly crime, and "Secret Sunshine," about a mother who turns -- briefly, disastrously -- to religion after a personal crisis.
The prolific director Hong Sang-soo is another mainstay on the festival scene, though his movies often secure limited theatrical distribution in the United States. His narratively supple and inventive films chart the coordinates of desire among men and women who share and overshare, often during alcohol-soaked conversations. Few directors do so much with so ostensibly little, but, at Hong's best, worlds of feeling are revealed in scenes of people facing one another -- and themselves -- across a table littered with soju bottles. "The Power of Kangwon Province," "Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors," "Turning Gate," "Woman on the Beach," "The Day He Arrives," "The Day After," "Hotel by the River" -- there's a lot to choose from, so get watching.
Plus! One of my favorite movies of the past decade is Park Chan-wook's "The Handmaiden," a wild, often very funny and touching erotic thriller. Kim Ki-duk isn't always my cup of cruelty, but I like his self-portrait "Arirang," which he made in the wake of a near-fatal accident on one of his shoots. Na Hong-jin's first feature, "The Chaser," is a pitch-black action movie about a cop-turned-pimp hunting down a serial killer and features, as its title suggests, a lot of cat-and-mouse scrambling. His most recent release, "The Wailing," is an unnerving, sprawling horror movie about demonic possession in a small town; it's good, but I prefer "The Yellow Sea," a blood-soaked tour de force of kinetic action and choreographed mayhem topped with acid politics.
Gilbert: This is wonderful! But, really, I think I only have time for one movie at the moment.
Manohla: Hmm. Well, start either with "The Host" (if you're in the mood for monsters) or with "Burning" (monstrous humanity) -- you can't go wrong either way. Then again, I do love "The Handmaiden," "The Power of Kangwon Province" and ....

How Facebook's early decisions set the stage for scandal

Texto completo: Facebook has already made its mark on history. It's not the legacy Mark Zuckerberg would have chosen for it 16 years ago in his dorm room. But the social media platform has been intertwined in politics and social discord ever since its failure to spot the manipulation of its services during the 2016 presidential race. There has been much reflection about what led to that calamity - and whether anything has changed ahead of the big test of the 2020 election.
Steven Levy set out to write "Facebook" in the good old days of the summer of 2016. The book opens with Zuckerberg's first visit to Africa, where the tech conqueror is given a hero's welcome. In encounters with young engineers, Zuckerberg comes across as a plucky coder. He boils down his philosophy into "two real principles" that come from engineering: "The first is that you think of every problem as a system. And every system can be better."

How that approach falls short when the first clues of election interference emerge two months later gives Levy's project its purpose, infusing it with urgency and tension. Facebook's well-trod backstory takes on new meaning now that the company's choices around issues like privacy, free speech and growth at any cost have led to years of crises. Levy writes with verve - he calls Facebook a "twenty-first-century corporate Gatsby, careless in its privileges, self-involved in serving its own needs and pleasures" - but "Facebook" feels under-theorized. His deft observations don't stretch far enough to make monumental conclusions.
Even Levy admits he hit a wall. "Fishing for rosebuds is a futile pursuit with Mark Zuckerberg," Levy concludes. "Facebook may have to change, but Zuckerberg doesn't believe he has to."
There is already an entire library of books devoted to Facebook, with more to come this year. "The Facebook Effect" by David Kirkpatrick in 2010 was the first book the company agreed to cooperate on. "The Accidental Billionaires" by Ben Mezrich became the basis for the movie "The Social Network." Last year's "Zucked" by Roger McNamee was one of the first turncoat tales - the Zuckerberg confidante made part of his venture capital fortune on Facebook then became a harsh critic of the company. Two New York Times reporters, Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang, got a seven-figure deal to write about Facebook's crises, and their book is expected to publish later this year. Coming in April is "No Filter," a profile of Instagram, Facebook's photo-sharing site, by Bloomberg News reporter Sarah Frier.
As with Kirkpatrick a decade ago, Facebook agreed to give access to Levy, who had previously done the same kind of thing with Google and has covered technology for decades. He gets the official take on how Facebook discovered the Russian propaganda program during the election and the internal chaos when the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the scheme to obtain the private data of 71 million Americans to use in political targeting, cracked open.
But Levy struggles to obtain the kind of soul-searching one might expect with so much access. "Maybe it just takes someone far better than me to do this," Zuckerberg admits at his most introspective, during the last of seven interviews Levy conducted with him for the book.
Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, who plays a co-starring role in the book, seems more transformed than her boss. Levy makes her cry at one point. She expresses the frustration, the loss of innocence that escapes Zuckerberg. But Levy also paints a picture of how her authority in the company is limited to everything that isn't engineering, the sacred skill that Zuckerberg oversees.
It's easier - for anyone - to spot Facebook's flaws in hindsight. Levy is able to trace the origins of the Cambridge Analytica scheme to Facebook's disregard for the privacy of the first users. Early pushes for growth set the stage for fake news to flourish. In discussing the development of the News Feed and advertising, Levy foreshadows the future misuse by rogue actors, including Russia's Internet Research Agency, the group charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with interfering in the election.
Seen through the lens of where Facebook is now, elements of the past take on attributes they might not have originally. We hear about Zuckerberg as a toddler orchestrating wars among his Ninja Turtles, something millions of other kids probably did, too - only for the boy genius, it now signals an inclination toward organizing society. Similarly, his playing of games such as Risk and Civilization seemed to predestine him to amass great power. On the other hand, the offhand observation by his parents that he didn't consider other options for college besides Harvard can be read as him thinking too narrowly when later faced with tough decisions as a chief executive.
Certain of Zuckerberg's beliefs that shape the company are portrayed as givens. Most critical is what Levy describes as his "passion" for free speech, going back to Facebook's early days as a start-up. That principle has enabled the spread of hate speech, political lies and conspiracies that have divided societies in ways Zuckerberg never imagined. Facebook set aside more drastic measures to curb disinformation, Levy writes, because they "would be a violation of Zuckerberg's core belief." Understanding what shapes Zuckerberg's beliefs is illuminating, when they have such an outsize impact on the world.
But Levy lingers too long on Facebook's early years before getting to the cataclysms. Nearly two-thirds of the book passes before we get to the election, the part of Facebook's history that the company hasn't already spilled its guts on.
During those moments of crisis, it doesn't feel like we're a fly on the wall in Zuckerberg's Aquarium, the glass-walled conference room that Facebookers have been trained not to gawk at when they walk by.
The story of Cambridge Analytica, for instance, is told from the perspective of the people who exploited Facebook's lax rules and the journalists who uncovered the machinations - not by sticking it to the people who allowed such a catastrophe. Facebook lays the blame on its outside law firm. Levy lets the company get away with a general sense of corporate failure by characterizing it as "what Facebook did not do," rather than showing which individuals dropped the ball. We're back inside Facebook only when Zuckerberg is preparing to appear in front of Congress, one of the consequences of the Cambridge Analytica revelation.
Levy doesn't shy from asking the tough questions. He tries to hold Zuckerberg accountable for providing a "platform for troublemakers." But he can't get past the veneer of Facebook's talking points. "We have a lot of work to do," Zuckerberg says, one of several permutations of his mea culpas (he has a tendency to drop Latin phrases to motivate his troops - such as "Carthago delenda est" - Carthage must be destroyed).
But Levy seems at times too charmed by his access. When suddenly Facebook is in the hot seat after the 2016 election (which Levy euphemizes as "epic PR problems"), he comes across as in awe that the company didn't unfriend him and break off its commitment to share its side of the story.
Ultimately, Levy struggles to provide answers for the existential problems he raises and to make sense of the constant flood of Facebook drama. The attempt to weave in episodes from as recently as a few months ago, such as the botched launch of a cryptocurrency, a record privacy fine and antitrust scrutiny, raises the question of where to stop with a story that's ongoing - and at what point the news takes on enough significance to become history. The issue we're left with is this: Is Facebook doomed to repeat its past mistakes?

Texto completo: With disposable cameras, the hardest part is the waiting.
In the past year, we sent the cheap, plastic cameras to women across the country, along with a simple task. We asked them to photograph their lives over the course of a few weeks: their loved ones, their Friday nights, their quiet moments alone. They sent the cameras back to us, and we took them to one of the remaining film shops in Washington, a block from our office, to get them developed.
These women are mothers, Hollywood actresses, retirees. They are cookbook authors and NASCAR drivers and college students. They span four generations, live in the Midwest and California and the Northeast and the South.
In the age of Instagram and the Internet, it's too easy to snap, edit and curate our lives. Instead, these women captured their lives on film, with no real idea of which photos would turn out, no ability to edit away the imperfections. Then, they waited. Maybe you know the feeling " that fluttery anticipation when a boxy camera is magically transformed into photographs.
In the end, The Disposables is an exercise in patience. In taking the time to see the world through women's eyes. We wondered, what do those moments look like " the ones worth waiting for?
You're about to find out.







Kristen Bell An actress and singer, best known for her starring roles in NBC's 'The Good Place' and Disney's 'Frozen.' She is 39 and lives in Los Angeles. 'I entered into this project for the fun factor, but ultimately it had an unexpected impact. I use social media often and have become accustomed to this newfangled way of capturing our lives " one steeped in perfection and extrinsic validation. This transported me to a time before instant gratification. To a time when we didn't take 30 pictures in anticipation of picking just one. To a time that is much more present. It made me reflect on the imperative we place on immediacy in today's culture and the habitual desire to capture our 'best' selves. This project reminded me that it's actually the small, non-filtered moments that make up our 'best' self.'
Princess Nokia A musical artist and actress whose birth name is Destiny Frasqueri. Her most recent singles include 'Sugar Honey Iced Tea' and 'Balenciaga.' She is 27 and lives in New York City. 'I am excited for this next chapter in my life. I'm both nervous and excited. I'm happy to have been a part of this project and share snapshots of my world the last couple of months.'
Katie Couric An award-winning journalist. She is 63 and lives in New York City. 'Most of these pictures were taken in my happy place, East Hampton. Summer is my favorite season and the rare times I can have my girls together is such a treat. We have a routine in the Hamptons. We often go to Goldberg's to pick up iced coffee before we go spinning and grab bagels afterwards. The white table with the shells on it used to be on my parents' porch in Virginia, so I always think of them when I look at it. I love dining alfresco (as they say), so I wanted to get a shot of my table prepped for a delicious summer meal. I think Wiborg is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, so of course I had to capture that too. Especially late in the afternoon with cheese and wine at the ready.'
Cynthia Gutierrez A program manager at the University of California at San Francisco's medical center. She is 29 and lives in Oakland, Calif. 'As a first-generation Central American who grew up in San Francisco, the city is no longer my home. My family and I were pushed out before the tech boom came to the Bay Area. I currently live in the Fruitvale district of Oakland " one of the few diverse neighborhoods in the city. I wanted my pictures to show Oakland construction that continues to contribute to the gentrification of the town in juxtaposition with pictures that show communities that continue to exist and resist being pushed out.'
Julia Landauer A professional NASCAR racing driver. She is 28 and lives in Charlotte. 'I travel a lot, but the week that I documented was by far the busiest, with six states and two countries being covered in one week. I found that I wanted to capture the 'seemingly mundane' things that are different from place to place. I found I asked people to take photos of me 'in action,' because so much of my life is centered around the physical and the moving.'
Lynn Fowler Retired. She was previously a ranch and rural land appraiser. She is 74 and splits her time between Silver City, N.M., and Tucson. 'Most of my photos were in New Mexico, some in Arizona, but in both locations I was drawn to photograph my animals and the outdoors " the beings and places that I treasure and give solace.'
Alison Roman A cook, writer and the author of the cookbooks 'Dining In' and 'Nothing Fancy.' She is 34 and lives in New York City. 'Some of these photos are from shooting the New York Times' 'Small Kitchen, Big Thanksgiving' video, hence all the equipment. There were so many people in my apartment that night, we drank so much wine, we had the best time. You can watch it all on YouTube. And here was the turkey, pre-roast. I roast mine on a sheet pan instead of a roasting pan because honestly I do not own a roasting pan and don't think you need to, either. Maybe the best turkey I've ever had (the recipe lives on the NYT Cooking site).'
Dorothy McCluskey Formerly worked in health IT. She's now a stay-at-home mom. She is 32 and lives in Harrington, Del. 'As a first-time, stay-at-home mom who left a rewarding job, my days now consist of changing diapers and keeping my 17-month-old from eating cat food off the floor. While not terribly exciting, these photos are a good reflection of my daily life. Staying at home with my son has taught me to see things from a child's perspective again and enjoy the little things.'
Grace Potter A Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter. Potter released her most recent album, 'Daylight,' in October. She is 36 and lives in Topanga, Calif. 'There's something incredibly gratifying about not getting that 'instant' gratification. When I think about the days I had the disposable camera, I'm not as interested in the photos that were taken as I am in the way it made me reconsider the way I see the world. The point and shoot captured a window of time that was really exciting for me and I'm glad I had a different perspective on it. I actually went out and bought myself a point and shoot that's on tour with me now. I think that's how I'm going to document things from now on.'
Mary H.K. Choi The best-selling author of 'Emergency Contact' and 'Permanent Record.' She is 40 and lives in Brooklyn. 'I love the mystery and intentionality of this project. Taking photos without the satisfaction of instant gratification or filters is sort of freeing. Do-overs should have a cost, physically and energetically.'

Aisha Dee An Australian actress who has most recently starred in 'The Bold Type.' She is 26 and lives in Los Angeles. 'I love the way film captures life, the beauty in the imperfection. Honestly I don't even remember what I took photos of, and that's the best part. The anticipation of waiting for a roll of film to be processed reminds me of growing up; there's something kind of romantic about it.'
Saher Jilani A training manager. She is 40 and lives in Annapolis. 'This was fun, and I'm excited to see what comes from the whole project.'
Karen Lynn Haver A retired arts administrator. She is 50 and sails between locations. 'The project was interesting. After a winter in the Bahamas, we were in the United States with a plan to sail the East Coast. Family issues and boat projects kept us tied to a dock for most of the summer. I remember trying to look at the world through a different lens (literally). We are so used to instant share with all the filters and editing. My world is both very small, living in about 300 square feet, and immense, with the world outside my door when we move. I tried to share a bit of both of these views.'

For Trump, a reckoning has come

Texto completo: As markets continued their dizzying downward spiral and other countries took heroic measures to fight coronavirus, President Trump sat down at the White House Thursday evening with two leading public-health authorities: Diamond and Silk.
Trump told the online provocateurs and other African American supporters about his "incredible," "very good," "great," "best" and "fantastic" response to the virus.
"It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle," he told them.
The real problem, he said, is Democrats and the press, who aren't giving him "credit," who are trying to "build this up," and who are demanding a bigger federal response. Amid an extended attack on Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, Trump said: "Politics is fine, but when it comes time to talk about pandemics you've got to get away from politics."
If only he could heed his own advice.
Sure, some Democrats are taking political advantage, but mostly they're demanding the Trump administration do more. And so are Republicans.
The one playing politics is Trump, cheerleading about miracles and silencing those trying to prepare the public. It won't work - investors obviously see through the happy talk - and by playing down the crisis, he's causing preparedness and monitoring to lag, which will worsen the spread.
What Americans need now is massive federal mobilization. Instead, Trump has pulled out the usual tricks, contradicting experts, blaming the "fake news media" for the market plunge, condemning opponents and even some of his own appointees (at the Federal Reserve), changing the subject, and making things up.
Thursday night, the New York Times reported that the White House has ordered officials to seek approval from Vice President Pence's office before speaking publicly about the epidemic - apparently a move to muzzle public-health officials and scientists.
In his first major remarks after taking over the coronavirus response, Pence spoke Thursday to the CPAC convention, a conservative gathering: "I'm here for one reason and one reason only, and that is our movement, our party and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House!" He seemed oblivious to the absurdity that 73 seconds earlier, he had declared that, because of coronavirus, "This is not the time for partisanship."
It's standard when losing a political argument to protest that the other side is playing politics. But it was Sen. Richard Shelby (Ala.), a Republican, who warned that the administration is "lowballing" the amount needed to respond to an emerging pandemic and "will pay for it later."
Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah), another Republican, says he's "very disappointed in the degree to which we've prepared for a pandemic."
Sen. John Neely Kennedy (La.), also a Republican, expressed incredulity at the administration's lack of information.
And Republican Sen. Mike Braun (Ind.), when asked on MSNBC whether Trump's past actions left the country less ready than it could have been, said: "I think you could make that argument."
Clearly. Last year, Trump disbanded disease-security groups in the National Security Council and Department of Homeland Security created during the Ebola outbreak. He has attempted dramatic cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He has disparaged the expertise and thinned the ranks of scientists throughout the government.
Now, we see a depleted federal government struggling to respond to coronavirus: flawed diagnostic tests and disagreements about lab capabilities; fewer than 500 tested in the United States as of midweek, compared to 7,100 in Britain (with one-fifth the population); inadequate protection for health-care workers; infighting in the administration; and a president who seems not to know what he's talking about.
At his briefing Wednesday evening, Trump declared, "This is a flu," and that Americans, like him, should "bail out as much as possible when there's sneezing."
A questioner pointed out that the death rate for seasonal flu is 0.1 percent, compared to 2 percent to 3 percent for coronavirus.
"The flu is much higher than that," Trump replied, incorrectly.
In previous crises of this magnitude, Trump's predecessors dropped everything else. George W. Bush unified the country after the 9/11 attacks in a bipartisan rethinking of national security. Barack Obama relied on members of Bush's team, such as Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner, to spare the country a second Great Depression.
Now Trump faces his first major crisis. And he's sitting down with Diamond and Silk, meeting with actors from a "low- budget conservative play" called "FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers," firing off "caronavirus" tweets attacking Democrats and the media, and holding a political rally where he calls the coronavirus a "hoax." (Trump said Saturday that "hoax" referred to Democrats' pinning blame for the virus.)
But a reckoning has come for Trump's politics of distraction, deception and blame. The markets see through it. And Americans will hold him responsible if he doesn't do more, fast, to protect us.

Bloomberg's no centrist. He wants the government to run your whole life.

Texto completo: Few politicians reach for nanny-state solutions as often as he does, says journalist
Any day now, Americans could wake up to the prospect of a months-long slog between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and President Trump. Faced with the dispiriting choice between shouty democratic socialism and barky populist nationalism, voters may find themselves grasping for any lifeline in the vast ocean between the two ideological poles. One option is the once and maybe future independent, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has pushed himself into the "centrist" lane in the Democratic primary race, offering himself as an alternative to middle-of-the-roaders Joe Biden, former mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.).
But Bloomberg is no centrist, no matter how much he cultivates the label. His policy positions are not the "moderate," reasonable middle ground between extremes. No, the right word to describe Bloomberg is "statist." He's the leading exemplar, even more than Sanders, of addressing problems "pragmatically" by hitting the big red button labeled "government."
Advocating for federal intervention at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Bloomberg on "Meet the Press" delivered arguably the single most succinct summation of do-something governance: "Nobody knows exactly what they should do, but anything is better than nothing." The hastily conceived "anything" in this case included using taxpayer money to cover for the reckless decision-making of the country's wealthiest financial institutions, an outrage so blatant it helped spark not one but two populist backlashes: the tea party on the right and Occupy Wall Street on the left.
Such is the track record of panicky government crisis responses, the most notorious of which Bloomberg has dependably backed over the years.
The Iraq War? He still doesn't regret his support, which led to such awkward-for-2020 moments as the then-mayor, currently running as a Democrat, praising President George W. Bush during the 2004 Republican National Convention for "leading the global war on terrorism."
How about covert, warrantless surveillance of Americans exercising their political and religious rights after 9/11? Check. The drug war? As recently as last January, the self-declared onetime pot enthusiast turned overseer of the marijuana arrest capital of the world called legalizing marijuana "perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done." (He only very recently altered his prohibitionism to advocate decriminalizing individual possession "if you have a small amount.")
Back when he was promoting his version of centrism as a trans-partisan independent in 2012, Bloomberg depicted his effort as anti-ideological "problem solving." In reality, the only limits on problem solving - at least until that pesky Constitution is applied - are governmental capacity and politicians' ability to identify problems. And boy, does Bloomberg see them everywhere.
People, for example, don't always eat healthfully. So in the name of public health, as mayor he went after, among many other things, food carts, trans fats and salt, lecturing to a United Nations General Assembly meeting that "there are powers only governments can exercise, policies only governments can mandate and enforce, and results only governments can achieve."
When courts blocked Bloomberg's infamous efforts to limit the size of sodas, his response was equally ideological. "We have a responsibility as human beings to do something, to save each other, to save the lives of ourselves, our families, our friends and all of the rest of the people that live on God's planet," he proclaimed. "And so while other people will wring their hands over the problem of sugary drinks, in New York City, we're doing something about it."
If you're detecting a line of governmental paternalism toward citizen-subjects - including but not limited to his post-mayoral leadership role in restricting people's access to guns and electronic cigarettes - Bloomberg will cop right to it. Addressing sin taxes in a 2018 interview, he said: "Some people say, well, taxes are regressive. But in this case, yes they are! That's the good thing about them, because the problem is in people that don't have a lot of money. And so, higher taxes should have a bigger impact on their behavior and how they deal with themselves." He added, "The question is, do you want to pander to those people, or do you want to get them to live longer?"
Thankfully, Bloomberg's brand of statism, unlike that of Sanders, at least recognizes that the government does not have limitless capacity, either in terms of resources or competence. So he'll occasionally veer in policy directions such as expanding school choice and acknowledging that trillion-dollar deficits are a flagrantly irresponsible risk.
But unlike Sanders (or, depending on the day of the week, Trump), Bloomberg does not apply that logic to some life-or-death issues such as foreign policy, surveillance and policing. In a New York Times candidate questionnaire, Bloomberg backed Trump's legally dubious drone killing of Qasem Soleimani, said he would keep troops in Afghanistan at least until the end of his first presidential term, and said he would preserve the option to use military force to protect oil shipments and prevent nuclear tests by Iran and North Korea. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, he advised Americans to buck up and get ready for more intrusive levels of surveillance: "Our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution I think have to change."
As for policing, back when he was still defending New York's controversial "stop, question and frisk" policy - that is, until he launched his presidential campaign - Bloomberg justified shaking down innocents, mostly black and Latino, as a way to discourage people from carrying guns. At least one federal judge didn't share his enthusiasm for these wholesale discriminatory, unreasonable searches.
There is nothing inherently centrist about a police state. To the extent that people who imagine themselves to be in the ideological middle support politicians who repeatedly back government prerogative over individual rights, our coming Trump-Sanders moment may provide an opportunity for self-reflection.
Americans don't much like being bossed around. And the serial, unacknowledged failures of the do-something class have made ideological deviants like Trump and Sanders look a lot less scary to a lot of people. Maybe when "centrist" politicians look less statist, more of us politically homeless types will find them more attractive.
"It's the government's job to have good science and to explain to people what science says or how to take care of themselves and extend their lives," Bloomberg posited during Tuesday's debate in South Carolina. "We are a country where there are too many people that are obese. We should do something about that."
Hopefully, he won't get a chance.

Texto completo: Ross Douthat may be the best opinion columnist in America. Every week in the pages of the New York Times, he delivers the political and cultural world to us in super-smart, marvelously efficient and often appealingly dorky columns that bear the mark of deep engagement with both high intellectual theory and delish pop culture. His conservative politics aren't mine, but I read him knowing that he has dwelled in a spirit of openness with politics like mine as well with other worldviews radically different from both of ours.
It's disappointing but not terribly shocking that his great strengths as a short-form opinion writer - his genius for synthesis and his extraordinary judiciousness - become limiting flaws in his new book, "The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success." In the spirit of Douthatian engagement, however, there are things to say first about what's excellent in this serious, honest book.
We are, argues Douthat, living through a period of profound exhaustion in the cultural, political and economic life of the modern West. We're inventing less, having fewer kids, recycling old culture instead of creating new stuff, getting stuck in mostly dead political vernaculars and narcotizing ourselves with drugs, porn, tweets and superhero movies. And we're not an exception. Douthat's bet is that the rising nations of the east and south are likely to follow. We're running out of steam, everywhere and along multiple axes. Following the late social critic Jacques Barzun, Douthat calls this state of civilizational low energy "decadence."
"Decadence," he writes, "refers to economic stagnation, institutional decay, and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development . It describes a situation in which repetition is more the norm than innovation; in which sclerosis afflicts public institutions and private enterprises alike; in which intellectual life seems to go in circles; in which new developments in science, new exploratory projects, underdeliver compared with what people recently expected. And, crucially, the stagnation and decay are often a direct consequence of previous development. The decadent society is, by definition, a victim of its own significant success."
We have fancy phones but no flying cars, fancy phones but no colony on Mars, and Siri and Alexa (i.e. fancy phones) but no HAL 9000 or Lieutenant Commander Data. We play at socialism and fascism on Twitter, but the great ideologies of the modern era, including liberalism, are spent, and nothing new seems to be coalescing to take their place. God is dead. Rock-and-roll is dead. The novel is dead. A reanimated Frank Sinatra is touring with hologram Tupac. A reality TV star is our president.
There are good objections to Douthat's tapestry of ennui and exhaustion, and Douthat engages them directly and thoughtfully. Maybe the whole paradigm of progress and growth is bent in the first place: The good old days of growth and expansion were also the awful old days of colonization, slavery, environmental despoliation and oppression. Maybe we need to grow up, calm down and gradually depopulate rather than get on, be fruitful and push out. Alternatively, Douthat may simply be wrong about the trajectory of scientific innovation; perhaps we are at the dawn of an astonishing new age of genetic imagineering, artificial intelligence and fusion energy. Maybe he's mistaking a temporary malaise for a stable equilibrium. White dudes like him have been moaning about decadence for millennia, usually just before they lead us to war or get their heads vigorously lopped off.
Douthat doesn't vanquish these arguments so much as graciously acknowledge them, give them their due and then ask us to consider his perspective as well. And he repays our consideration with a glittering stream of associations and distinctions, resonances and rhymes that reinflect the world we thought we knew in fascinating ways. "The Decadent Society," like his weekly columns, is rich with insight, whether on the campus-based sex, speech and mental health bureaucracies of the "pink police state"; how social media amplifies our subjective experience of change even as it inhibits the cultural and intellectual spaces from which real change tends to emerge; or the role of video games, opioids and pornography in pacifying underemployed and undersexed young men.
"A society in thrall to digital entertainment," he writes, "offers its inhabitants the opportunity to experience savage and orgiastic pleasures on a scale far beyond what the real world could ever provide. Yet it also appears in some respect to be a realm of peace and order and care and good behavior and somewhat sleepy pleasures, because the kind of people - the young and discontented above all - who once threatened real turbulence and disruption and even revolution are inside texting or sexting, masturbating or playing a first-person shooter."
If "The Decadent Society" is a good book rather than a really good or great one, it is perhaps because it's too tight, too sane, too controlled. In his great book "Only a Promise of Happiness: The Place of Beauty in a World of Art," the philosopher Alexander Nehamas suggests that we cease to find things or people beautiful when we come to feel that we've exhausted what there is to know about them. When they no longer call out to us with the seductive promise of future happiness, they cease to shimmer with beauty. "The Decadent Society," as brilliant as it is in many ways, is too knowable to be beautiful. Too many of its joints connect too perfectly. Too many of its contradictions resolve neatly rather than quiver poetically in tension. In this sense it is as much a manifestation of decadence as an act of defiance against it.
In the final chapter of the book, "Providence," Douthat gets a bit weird. There are aliens, the economist Robin Hanson (himself something of an alien) and the possible return of the Messiah. It is a welcome weirdness after so much sanity. Even here, though, Douthat hedges.
"To be clear," he writes: "I'm not predicting the end of the world or the arrival of the millennium. . . . I'm just saying that if this were the age in which some major divine intervention happened, whether long prophesied or completely unforeseen, there would be, in hindsight, a case that we should have seen it coming. And it shouldn't surprise anyone if decadence ends with people looking heavenward: toward God, toward the stars, or both. So down on your knees - and start working on that warp drive."
Ross Douthat, down on thy knees thyself. You have only your chains to lose.

No, not Sanders, not ever

Texto completo: A few months ago, I wrote a column saying I would vote for Elizabeth Warren over Donald Trump. I may not agree with some of her policies, but culture is more important than politics. She does not spread moral rot the way Trump does.
Now I have to decide if I'd support Bernie Sanders over Trump.
We all start from personal experience. I covered the Soviet Union in its final decrepit years. The Soviet and allied regimes had already slaughtered 20 million people through things like mass executions and intentional famines. Those regimes were slave states. They enslaved whole peoples and took away the right to say what they wanted, live where they wanted and harvest the fruits of their labor.
And yet every day we find more old quotes from Sanders apologizing for this sort of slave regime, whether in the Soviet Union, Cuba or Nicaragua. He excused the Nicaraguan communists when they took away the civil liberties of their citizens. He's still making excuses for Castro.
To sympathize with these revolutions in the 1920s was acceptable, given their original high ideals. To do so after the Hitler-Stalin pact, or in the 1950s, is appalling. To do so in the 1980s is morally unfathomable.
I say all this not to cancel Sanders for past misjudgments. I say all this because the intellectual suppositions that led him to embrace these views still guide his thinking today. I've just watched populism destroy traditional conservatism in the GOP. I'm here to tell you that Bernie Sanders is not a liberal Democrat. He's what replaces liberal Democrats.
Traditional liberalism traces its intellectual roots to John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Social Gospel movement and the New Deal. This liberalism believes in gaining power the traditional way: building coalitions, working within the constitutional system and crafting the sort of compromises you need in a complex, pluralistic society.
This is why liberals like Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Warren were and are such effective senators. They worked within the system, negotiated and practiced the art of politics.
Populists like Sanders speak as if the whole system is irredeemably corrupt. Sanders was a useless House member and has been a marginal senator because he doesn't operate within this system or believe in this theory of change.
He believes in revolutionary mass mobilization and, once an election has been won, rule by majoritarian domination. This is how populists of left and right are ruling all over the world, and it is exactly what our founders feared most and tried hard to prevent.
Liberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism. Liberalism is horrified by cruelty. Sanders' leadership style embodies the populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarization, a demand for ideological purity among your friends and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.
A liberal leader confronts new facts and changes his or her mind. A populist leader cannot because the omniscience of the charismatic headman can never be doubted. A liberal sees shades of gray. For a populist reality is white or black, friend or enemy. Facts that don't fit the dogma are ignored.
A liberal sees inequality and tries to reduce it. A populist sees remorseless class war and believes in concentrated power to crush the enemy. Sanders is running on a $60 trillion spending agenda that would double the size of the federal government. It would represent the greatest concentration of power in the Washington elite in American history.
These days, Sanders masquerades as something less revolutionary than he really is. He claims to be nothing more than the continuation of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. He is 5% right and 95% wrong.
There was a period around 1936 or 1937 when Roosevelt was trying to pack the Supreme Court and turning into the sort of arrogant majoritarian strongman the founders feared. But this is not how FDR won the presidency, passed the New Deal, beat back the socialists of his time or led the nation during World War II. FDR did not think America was a force for ill in world affairs.
Sanders also claims he's just trying to import the Scandinavian model, which is believable if you know nothing about Scandinavia or what Sanders is proposing. Those countries do have generous welfare states, but they can afford them because they understand how free market capitalism works, with fewer regulations on business creation and free trade.
There is a specter haunting the world - corrosive populisms of right and left. These populisms grow out of real problems but are the wrong answers to them. For the past century, liberal Democrats from FDR to Barack Obama knew how to beat back threats from the populist left. They knew how to defend the legitimacy of our system, even while reforming it.
Judging by the last few debates, none of the current candidates remember those arguments or know how to rebut a populist to their left.
I'll cast my lot with democratic liberalism. The system needs reform. But I just can't pull the lever for either of the two populisms threatening to tear it down.

Texto completo: Two weeks ago, I was happily sailing on a huge cruise ship in the Indian Ocean.
My wife Colleen is a travel agent, and I was tagging along with her and her group on a Celebrity Cruise Line ship as it sailed from Dubai to Singapore and back with 2,300 souls aboard.
Everyone on board our ship knew what was happening that same week to the unlucky people stuck on the Diamond Princess cruise liner docked offshore Tokyo.
Because a passenger who left Diamond Princess nine days earlier in Hong Kong had tested positive for the new coronavirus sweeping China, the Japanese government had ordered everyone to stay aboard the luxury cruise ship.
We weren’t doctors or epidemiologists, just vacationers. But we knew that cooping up 2,666 people together on the Diamond Princess for 14 days was going to be trouble – and it was.
Because Japanese officials dithered around and then screwed up their containment measures on the ship for two weeks, the Diamond Princess became what the New York Times called “a floating epidemiological disaster.”
According to the Times, “with 634 infections and two deaths, the cruise ship represents the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.”
We were a lot luckier, even though we never made it all the way to Singapore.
Our wise captain decided it wasn’t worth the risk of getting any closer to the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, and we turned back to Dubai after stopping at Sri Lanka.
The Celebrity Cruise Line people did everything right. Everyone was compensated for their lost cruise time and given $500 to pay for straightening up their travel arrangements.
Most important, as far as I know, no one on our cruise ship caught the flu.
Since I’ve been back in Southern California, however, I’ve been getting sick watching the mainstream media sensationalize the dangers of the coronavirus.
Every time another country like Greece gets its first official coronovirus case, they throw up another panicky headline about how the deadly pandemic is seemingly putting every human on the planet at risk.
The mainstream media rarely take the trouble to point out that it is the already sick, the very old and the very young who are most likely to die from flu-caused problems like pneumonia, strokes and heart attacks.
The coronavirus may yet live up to its media hype and become a true pandemic in the United States or elsewhere that kills hundreds of thousands. I hope not.
But as the Dow Jones index dropped several thousand points this week, it would have been nice if the media had put the death toll of the coronavirus in the proper perspective.

SJ couple goes house hunting on TV show

Texto completo: "We were like, 'Should we do it? Are we going to be able to do it? Am I going to have this baby by then?' So we scheduled it tentatively."
Stephanie Scibal
HADDONFIELD – When Stephanie and Stephen Scibal were approached about appearing on HGTV's "Beachfront Bargain Hunt," they had one caveat for producers: An extra house hunter could arrive at any moment.
Stephanie was 38 weeks pregnant with the Stratford couple's first child when they filmed their episode in Ocean City last September.
"We were like, 'Should we do it? Are we going to be able to do it? Am I going to have this baby by then?' So we scheduled it tentatively," Stephanie said.
As it turned out, little Savanna Scibal — now nearly 5 months old — didn't upstage her parents' TV debut, which was set to air earlier this week..
But she was mentioned quite a bit as her parents looked for a vacation house that they also could use as a rental property.
"I would say, 'This would be nice for Savanna,' or 'Savanna would like this,' " Stephanie Scibal said during a recent interview in the conference room of her family's Haddonfield real estate office.
Scibal, 30, works with her parents, Bill and Jackie Souders, and brother, Will Souders, in the family business. So Scibal and her husband had no need for a real-estate agent as they checked out three homes on the episode titled "Ocean City Bound with a Baby."
HGTV producers connected with the Scibals on the recommendation of an Ocean City listings broker. But Stephanie took it from there.
"That's why this episode is a little different," Scibal said. "Stephen was essentially my buyer. We were both my buyer ... but I would take him to the listings and open the door just like he would be a buyer, and do the negotiating for us."
Stephen, 33, was a satisfied customer, telling his wife, "I want to buy more houses. That was great, having you as the negotiator."
Couple has many ties to Ocean City Ocean City has a sentimental attachment for the Scibals: It's the first place they met.
Stephen, a medical-device salesman who grew up in Northfield, was a member of the Ocean City Beach Patrol. He and Stephanie met at a lifeguard party when he was 18 and she was 16.
But that was all there was to it, until years later when the two reconnected while both were living in Philly.
After they were married, they returned every weekend to Ocean City, where Stephen's family has a beach house.
"His sisters both have babies, we just had our first baby. We were like, 'It's getting crowded over there,' so that's when we decided to start looking for our own place."
HGTV viewers will likely see Stephen commenting that one of the houses they check out looks familiar.
"When we got there, he realized he had rented it during senior week" back in his lifeguard days, Stephanie said. "That was funny, for him to walk in and have all these memories of having a high school party there."
In a reverse of the typical order, the Scibals shopped for a vacation home before buying a primary residence. They currently rent their Stratford home from Stephanie's parents.
But as a real estate agent who watches trends, Stephanie noted that the New York Times reported on couples buying a second home first in vacation spots such as the Hamptons or the Catskills while continuing to rent in the city.
The Scibals bought their Ocean City home as an investment, so they'll rent it during the peak summer months and stay there before and after the season.
It won't be easy to hand over the keys, Stephanie acknowledged.
"We're falling more and more in love with the house."
All the homes the Scibals looked at for the episode were in Ocean City's north end. Their other home-buying criteria included two to three bedrooms, and at least two bathrooms. They were open to a duplex or a single-family home.
Baby kept crew on tight schedule There were long days of filming the HGTV show, especially for a very pregnant Stephanie.
"It was four days of filming, eight- to 10-hour days in the summer heat, end of September, middle of September," she said.
But Stephanie felt fine as the couple took part in activities around Ocean City, including riding on a Ferris wheel. And she enjoyed a little leisure time on the beach as Stephen surfed.
The fun-in-the-sun vibe is part of what drew the Scibals to buy in Ocean City.
"Something unique about it is that it's a dry town, which makes it a really nice family area," Stephanie said. "You have the boardwalk and really good surfing ... hopefully we show Ocean City in a good light and people will want to visit or buy their own vacation home."
The pregnancy was never far from producers' minds during filming.
"Some of them were like, 'Should we do that scene first?' " Stephanie said, explaining the crew wanted to make sure they had crucial scenes shot in case she went into labor.
Stephanie said the couple didn't have any hesitation about being on camera.
"I guess we're both outgoing people," she said. "It was fun."
Since the Scibals purchased their beachfront bargain, they have been busy with renovations. They even made the property homey for the holidays by putting up a Christmas tree.
They plan to have a watch party when "Beachfront Bargain Hunt" airs on HGTV. But there will be an unavoidable spoiler alert for party guests: The event will be at the Scibals' new Ocean City home, so everyone will know the ending.
Stephanie said she's also eager to someday show the episode to Savanna — who was on board for the episode even if she wasn't on camera.
"I'm excited for her to watch this eventually."

Texto completo: No fake news here. "Going to Museums May be Good for Your Health" is the title of a recent New York Times article. "People engaged in the arts lived longer than those who were not, a study found."
The New Jersey Maritime Museum can attest to the above. Visitors of all ages come in with smiling faces, questions galore, and bring stories of their own. Docents are equally friendly, full of New Jersey's history, and can usually answer most questions, find a book with the information sought, or give them the name and email of someone who can.
"There is evidence that simply being exposed to the arts may help people ... who just went to a museum just once or twice a year were 14% less likely less likely to die during that period."
Put visiting the NJ Maritime Museum a few times a year on your calendar or in your head. That should increase your chances of living longer.
To continue with excerpts from the New York Times article:
"Researchers theorized that people who expose themselves to the arts are more likely to be engaged in the world. Being involved and excited by the arts keeps and maintains your purpose in life.
"The study also noted that engaging in the arts can reduce loneliness, promote empathy and emotional intelligence, and keep people from becoming sedentary – all factors that contribute to a longer life."
The above could be a personal advertisement for volunteering at the NJ Maritime Museum. Needed are summer volunteers (June – Labor Day weekend) who will donate one day a week of their time to greet visitors and show them around. Also needed are year round volunteers to come in on their own time to organize some of the 400 GB of scanned high resolution photos and rare documents.
Are you looking for an internship in the coming months? The museum needs people of all ages and abilities. For example, can you write grants? Call 609-492-0202 or email info@NJMM.org. Like Uncle Sam pointed in World War II posters, "We Want You." You won't find a finer group of people who can laugh and yet get the job done than at the NJ Maritime Museum.
"Similar studies have shown the benefits of exposing children and adolescents to art, and found that children who were taken to on field trips to museums performed better in school and higher on standardized tests than those who did not take field trips."
Grade school children and older ones who know more history love the museum. They are full of questions, and get a small education about New Jersey maritime and local history that is no longer taught in schools. We love kids and they love us.
"Advocates said the study was a reminder of how critical it is for the arts to be more accessible to Americans of all incomes."
There is no admission charge to visit the NJ Maritime Museum at 528 Dock Road. in Beach Haven. Donations are cheerfully accepted in boxes if people choose.
Nast Dive Room Speaking of donations, the family foundation of Michael G. Nast has made a donation in his honor, and the dive room at the museum will be officially named the Michael G. Nast Dive Room. Michael was born in Mount Holly, graduated from Haverford College and Cornell Law School.
Michael died doing what he loved best, diving. He was an accomplished New Jersey wreck diver, and participated in Long Beach Island events including the 18 Mile Run. In addition he loved fishing and hunting. Michael Nast was an assistant district attorney in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and was active in the American Bar Association. New exhibits will be on display this coming summer in the Michael G. Nast Diving Room.
"Peace, tranquility, and rejuvenation" are mentioned in the New York Times article. Peace may be found by learning the fate of a loved one at sea. Rejuvenation can be found when members and visitors echo "I never knew that!" But the NJ Maritime Museum does not promise tranquility. Hopefully, all visitors will be excited, taking pictures, asking questions and telling stories of their own.
Make a resolution in 2020 to visit, join, and volunteer at the New Jersey Maritime Museum. Volunteers are needed, and the New York Times article has just proved that the public needs the NJ Maritime Museum.

Texto completo: Acclaimed stand-up comedian Lewis Black will bring his "It Gets Better Every Day" tour to the Elgin Community College Arts Center on Thursday, March 12. The performance begins at 8 p.m.
"When I say, ‘It gets better every day,’ you might be wondering, ‘Is he being facetious?’ Come to the show and find out. Or stay home and wallow in your sadness," says Black.
Known as the King of the Rant, Black uses his trademark style of comedic yelling and animated finger-pointing to skewer anything and anyone that gets under his skin. His comedic brilliance lies in his ability to make people laugh at the absurdities of life, with topics that include current events, social media, politics, and anything else that exposes the hypocrisy and madness he sees in the world.

Black has released eight comedy albums and won two Grammy® Awards. In 2012, he performed eight sold-out shows at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway. In 2015, Black voiced the character Anger in the Academy Award®-winning Pixar film "Inside Out."
Amid a rigorous touring schedule, regular TV appearances and movie roles, Black has written three best-selling books: "Nothing’s Sacred," "Me of Little Faith," and "I’m Dreaming of a Black Christmas." All garnered critical praise as well as commercial success and spent numerous weeks on The New York Times bestsellers list.

Texto completo: A few months ago, I wrote a column saying I would vote for Elizabeth Warren over Donald Trump. I may not agree with some of her policies, but culture is more important than politics. She does not spread moral rot the way Trump does.
Now I have to decide whether I’d support Bernie Sanders over Trump.
We all start from personal experience. I covered the Soviet Union in its final decrepit years. The Soviet and allied regimes had already slaughtered 20 million people through things like mass executions and intentional famines. Those regimes were slave states. They enslaved whole peoples and took away the right to say what they wanted, live where they wanted and harvest the fruits of their labor.
And yet every day we find more old quotes from Sanders apologizing for this sort of slave regime, whether in the Soviet Union, Cuba or Nicaragua. He excused the Nicaraguan communists when they took away the civil liberties of their citizens. He’s still making excuses for Castro.
To sympathize with these revolutions in the 1920s was acceptable, given their original high ideals. To do so after the Hitler-Stalin pact, or in the 1950s, is appalling. To do so in the 1980s is morally unfathomable.
I say all this not to cancel Sanders for past misjudgments. I say all this because the intellectual suppositions that led him to embrace these views still guide his thinking today. I’ve just watched populism destroy traditional conservatism in the GOP. I’m here to tell you that Bernie Sanders is not a liberal Democrat.
He’s what replaces liberal Democrats.
Traditional liberalism traces its intellectual roots to John Stuart Mill, John Locke, the Social Gospel movement and the New Deal. This liberalism believes in gaining power the traditional way: building coalitions, working within the constitutional system and crafting the sort of compromises you need in a complex, pluralistic society.
This is why such liberals as Hubert Humphrey, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Warren were and are such effective senators. They worked within the system, negotiated and practiced the art of politics.
Populists like Sanders speak as if the whole system is irredeemably corrupt. Sanders was a useless House member and has been a marginal senator because he doesn’t operate within this system or believe in this theory of change.
He believes in revolutionary mass mobilization and, once an election has been won, rule by majoritarian domination. This is how populists of left and right are ruling all over the world, and it is exactly what our founders feared most and tried hard to prevent.
Liberalism celebrates certain values: reasonableness, conversation, compassion, tolerance, intellectual humility and optimism. Liberalism is horrified by cruelty.
Sanders’ leadership style embodies the populist values, which are different: rage, bitter and relentless polarization, a demand for ideological purity among your friends and incessant hatred for your supposed foes.
I’ll cast my lot with democratic liberalism. The system needs reform. But I just can’t pull the lever for either of the two populisms threatening to tear it down.

Only cauliflower can save us now

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Ronny L. Jackson, the former White House physician who gained instant fame in 2018 for his news conference attesting to President Trump’s astonishingly excellent, surpassingly superlative and supremely splendiferous good health, is back in the news.
The good doctor, whose nomination to head the Department of Veterans Affairs fell apart after a report claimed he was dubbed the “Candy Man” for his freewheeling use of prescriptions, is now running for Congress in Texas. And he spoke to Annie Karni of The New York Times, in more candid terms, about Trump’s health and diet.
Instead of losing weight, as Jackson recommended, Trump slipped into clinical obesity. “The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to,” Jackson said. “But we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible, we were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes.”
Hiding the ice cream, sure. But sneaking cauliflower into the mashed potatoes? Using the buttery starch as a Trojan Horse to sneak nutrition past the presidential defenses? This is genius.
In fact, Jackson may have happened upon a whole new way of getting the results we want out of Trump without all the fuss — through dining-table trickery. Think of the grief it could have avoided in India during Trump’s visit this week.
Trump’s two primary food groups are hamburger and steak, but most Indians object to eating cows. So Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a vegetarian, tried to get Trump to eat his peas — or, rather, his broccoli. During a visit to the Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, Trump and his delegation were offered a no-meat menu that included fruits, chickpea flour cakes and, infamously, a “broccoli and corn button samosa.”
Big mistake. As a frequent Trump dining partner told CNN before the trip, “I have never seen him eat a vegetable.” Indians reacted in horror that their beloved samosa had been bastardized. And Trump didn’t so much as touch the food.
This international incident could have been avoided with some subterfuge in the kitchen. Modi could have had the samosas stuffed with Impossible Burger or another beef substitute — essentially a beef-flavored pill pocket, for people. Trump would have gobbled up the whole tray, none the wiser. Thus sated, he might even have signed off on a trade deal.
Trump aides have long used other forms of subterfuge to get what they want out of the president, as Washington Post contributor Daniel W. Drezner details in his forthcoming book, “The Toddler in Chief.” Former economic adviser Gary Cohn once stole a letter from Trump’s desk withdrawing the U.S. from a trade agreement with South Korea so that Trump would forget about the letter, and the withdrawal. Cohn also once ended a phone call from Trump by telling him he was “brilliant” and faking a bad connection.
Former chief of staff Reince Priebus delayed Trump’s return trips from weekend golf trips so he would watch (and live-tweet) less cable news. National Security Council officials found that they could trick Trump into reading memos if they kept mentioning Trump’s name. And aides helped persuade him to attend the 2018 NATO summit in Brussels by scheduling time for him at his golf resort in Scotland.
Tinkering with the presidential diet opens a new range of possibilities.
Let’s say, to use a purely hypothetical example, that Trump has taken to attacking a federal judge, a federal jury forewoman, federal prosecutors and even his own attorney general because they haven’t been lenient enough toward one of Trump’s convicted pals.
White House chefs, under the White House physician’s careful supervision, could sneak large amounts of ground turkey — known to be high in calm-inducing tryptophan — into the president’s morning sausages, his lunchtime taco bowls, his afternoon burgers and his meatloaf dinner.
Continuing our hypothetical, let’s say the president’s mood does not sufficiently improve. He begins purging the intelligence community of anybody who has not provided a notarized statement of loyalty to him. At this point, the surreptitious nutrition team might inject megadoses of high-fructose corn syrup into pastries, pizzas, hamburger buns, cakes and pies. After a brief sugar high, Trump would become lethargic, unable to complete the purge.
In a final hypothetical, let’s imagine public-health officials warn Americans to prepare for a dangerous virus, but Trump can’t even spell the name of the virus, and he sides with an economic adviser (one who predicted a “recovery” seven weeks before the crash of 2008) who says “we have contained this.” Even Republican lawmakers are dismayed.
So the Culinary Intervention Agency takes covert action. Highly trained nutritionists load the presidential Filet-O-Fish with capsaicin, a chili-pepper extract. The meal results in a coughing fit, and the germophobic president, convinced he has the unspellable virus, demands a multibillion-dollar mobilization.
The nation is saved — by stealth cuisine.

John Ratcliffe says 'experienced' intelligence officials 'have gotten it wrong' in defense of renewed spy chief bid

Texto completo: Rep. John Ratcliffe said his "different kind of experience" makes him a strong candidate for President Trump's top intelligence official.
The Texas Republican, who is being renominated to be the director of national intelligence, took on criticisms he faces as he explained why he is "absolutely" qualified at a time when the United States deals with national security threats such as the spread of the new coronavirus and another potential wave of Russian election interference, saying, "I’ve been handling national security issues as far back as 2005.”
"I haven't served in an intelligence agency. I think that bringing a different kind of experience today is really going to be vitally important. You know all of the experience in the world isn't helpful without judgment, and I think what we've seen is that some of our most experienced intelligence officials have gotten it wrong with respect to important issues," Ratcliffe told Catherine Herridge of CBS News.
His critique aligns with complaints by Trump, who has a history of breaking with intelligence assessments by his own agencies, and who has castigated top former officials who investigated his 2016 presidential campaign. Ratcliffe has been a leading voice in demanding accountability over allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI.
Trump initially nominated Ratcliffe to replace Dan Coats as the director last summer, but the congressman withdrew within days after some senators questioned his credentials and he was accused of overstating his professional record regarding the prosecution of Hamas terrorists.
“I reconsidered because the president asked me, and I think when the president asks you to do something for your country, you look at that,” Ratcliffe said. “I think I’ll have the support of all Republicans at the end of the day. I’m going to work hard to convince at least some of my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle.”

After Trump announced late Friday that he was renominating Ratcliffe, Democrats quickly fired off fresh complaints.
"Replacing one highly partisan operative with another does nothing to keep our country safe. At a time when the Russians are interfering in our elections, we need a nonpartisan leader at the helm of the Intelligence Community who sees the world objectively and speaks truth to power, and unfortunately, neither acting Director Grenell nor Rep. Ratcliffe comes even close to that," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
Trump defended his selection of Ratcliffe on Saturday, praising him as a “terrific man” during a wide-ranging news conference about the coronavirus earlier on Saturday. “He’s been fantastic at everything he’s done,” Trump added.
The president said Ratcliffe wanted him to hold off on a renomination to the top spy perch until after DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s FISA report had been released, which happened in December.
“He wanted to wait until after the IG report,” Trump told reporters. “The IG report has now come, and we’ve learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report, as you know very well.”
The president also predicted Ratcliffe will be confirmed by the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans.
“I think he’ll go through a process, and I think it’ll go fairly quickly. He’s a very respected man, somebody that I’ve gotten to like, somebody who really has — he’s someone who has really distinguished himself, I think, over the last year and a half or two years in particular,” Trump said. “So, we’re very happy with that.”
Last weekend, Ratcliffe, who is a member of the intelligence and judiciary panels, addressed disputed leaks about classified intelligence on Russian inference in the 2020 election.

“He's at it again by putting out, through his committee, information that is false,” the Texas lawmaker said. “Look, I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, but I don't know anyone in the last three years who has done more to help Vladimir Putin and Russia with their efforts to sow the seeds of discord in American elections and American election security than Adam Schiff has.”
Rep. Adam Schiff is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and he called Ratcliffe "an unqualified nominee who should not be confirmed."
The controversial classified briefing happened earlier this month and was conducted by Shelby Pierson, the Intelligence Community election threats executive under then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire. During the meeting, sources cited by the New York Times said Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”
Ratcliffe said, "We see when there's a story that is allegedly anti-Trump or negative for the president, it shows up in newspapers because either Democratic members or Democratic staffers leak it. The problem is, in this case, they have leaked information that's not accurate.”
A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Examiner that “Shelby did not say Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump.”
Ratcliffe has been a key inquisitor for Republicans in Congress. Under questioning from Ratcliffe during a House Judiciary Committee hearing this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray agreed that onetime Trump campaign associate Carter Page was surveilled illegally. “FBI Director Wray is right: counterfeiting evidence to conduct illegal surveillance is utterly unacceptable,” Ratcliffe tweeted after the hearing.
As head of the U.S. intelligence apparatus, Ratcliffe would tap into some of the most politically sensitive investigations and reforms that are underway.
It is already known the Justice Department found at least two of four FISA orders targeting Page were invalid. The FBI also told the FISA court it was working to sequester all the information obtained through the Page FISA warrants until the completion of a further review of the DOJ inspector general report and the "outcome of related investigations and any litigation."
At the Conservative Political Action Conference this week in Maryland, Ratcliffe weighed in on the congressional battle over FISA reform, defending the value of the surveillance law used to root out terrorists and spies. Noting that "maybe 25% of our foreign intelligence comes from that," Ratcliffe said it "serves our country well and saves lives" while also arguing it needed fixes.

Fauci denies being 'muzzled' over coronavirus

Texto completo: A top U.S. health official disputed claims that the Trump administration blocked him from speaking out about the new coronavirus.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, categorically denied on Saturday about being "muzzled" by any administration, dating back to the presidency of Ronald Reagan.
"Let me clarify. I have never been muzzled — ever," Fauci told reporters gathered at the White House for President Trump's news conference meant to provide an update on COVID-19.
Instead, he claimed there was a misunderstanding.
"We were set up to go on some shows, and when the vice president took over, we said, 'Let's regroup and figure out how we're going to be communicating.' So I had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance. And when I resubmitted for clearance, I got cleared," he said.
The New York Times reported that, on Thursday, Fauci met with Vice President Mike Pence, who was appointed the day before to lead the administration's coronavirus response effort, and described the virus as being "very serious," which contradicted what Trump said about the threat of the illness being less urgent. According to the report, Fauci told associates that the White House instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.
Trump initially responded to a reporter's question about Fauci and called it a "very dishonest question."
The news conference took place after Washington state announced the first death of a coronavirus patient on American soil.

Texto completo: It’s been a week of viruses and vitriol, jittery markets and even more jittery Democrats. Panic is in the air. Things are spinning out of control. The center cannot hold because there is no center in 2020.
But urgency is good. It focuses the mind. A corrupt, ignorant and inept president who has yet to face a crisis finally has something — the coronavirus, which has the outside potential to do to the human race what climate change may do to the planet — that he can’t demagogue away.
The need to replace him has never been greater. And yet, the Democratic field is badly flawed: four septuagenarians, a sensible man who looks too young to shave, two people who should have left the race weeks ago.
One must emerge in time to save the republic. And so, on to the necessary elimination. We will soon be entering the 10 days that could change the world. Here are some things that have to happen now:
Get out! It’s the title of a great horror movie. But also a necessary public service that should be performed immediately by Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg and perhaps Elizabeth Warren.
Roughly one-third of Democrats will be voting on Super Tuesday and the best that any of those candidates can realistically hope for is that two of them will win their home states.
Warren may not even carry Massachusetts. She hasn’t worn well, nor shown any strategic smarts. Yes, she took down Bloomberg, a paper tiger whose billions cannot buy him a joke-writer, a man shown to be both insufferably paternalistic and ungracefully imperious.
In Tuesday’s debate, she continued to fillet him. But that fish had already been fried. She spent her considerable powers to annoy on a man who has zero delegates. She seems — how to say this? — gutless to take on the one person squatting in her lane. Either make the strongest case against Bernie Sanders or get out.
Her fellow female senator has shown more Minnesota nice than Minnesota ice, no small thing considering she supposedly eats her salad with a comb when angry. And Klobuchar got off one of the better lines Tuesday: “If we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we’re going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.”
Politician, heed thy advice: Be gone now for the good of two-thirds of Democrats who have yet to warm to Sanders. The likable Klobuchar would make a great vice president. Having her on the ticket is one way to sway the three swing states that could earn her the job.
Mayor Pete is a delight — intelligent, quick on his feet, a man of faith but also a man married to another man, and as such, a groundbreaker. Give him four years and some gray hair and he’ll be ready for the show.
Buttigieg will not win a state on Super Tuesday — not even close — and should give up the dream of 2020 before the calendar turns to March. But thanks for that line Tuesday about a general election race between a man stuck in the social mores of the 1950s and another man frozen in the revolutionary politics of the ’60s.
The pair of billionaires, Steyer and Bloomberg, are vanity candidates who should look in the mirror of reality. They can do the country an enormous favor by spending zillions in the general election, helping along those who are still blind to the fraud of Donald Trump.
If most of the above candidates don’t leave the race now, we could have a situation on Tuesday where Sanders wins, say, 30% of the vote in California, but no other candidate gets any pledged delegates. The threshold is 15% of the statewide vote. So, two-thirds of Democrats could vote for someone other than Sanders and he would be the only one with something to show for it. That’s insane.
Now, to the chase: Joe Biden vs. Bernie, back where it started. Sigh. “I’m not going to be quiet anymore!” said Biden, trying on his alpha male. Actually, he doesn’t have to shout like red-faced Bernie to prove he has a pulse.
Sanders’ dogmatic inflexibility is also his strength with the kids — He’s so authentic! Donald Trump makes Bernie viable. In an era of chaos, why not vote for a grumpy ideologue with a heart condition who sees the world as a class struggle.
You should be careful making political predictions in our perilous era, but there is one I can make with assurance: Four more years of Trump would be catastrophic. Look what’s he’s already done — attacking Supreme Court justices, trying to interfere with the rule of law, ousting good public servants to get revenge — since impeachment.
A president who tried to create a post-facto hurricane forecast with a Sharpie now tells us to trust him on the coronavirus. His concern is self-survival, not public health. He was livid after his own top epidemiologists warned that the virus would soon be spreading within our borders.
Keep the respiratory mask handy and hope the Democrats can find a vaccine for self-destruction.

Texto completo: During his news conference Saturday, President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force authorized elevated warnings against travel to specific regions in Italy and South Korea.
The president also authorized new restrictions on travelers who have been to Iran, The New York Times reported. Vice President Mike Pence said travel restrictions to parts of Italy and South Korea were raised to Level 4, the highest of the four levels created by the Department of State.

Traveling, particularly overseas, has now become more of a concern for Americans.
So what does each travel advisory level mean? Here’s a look.
Level 1: This is the lowest advisory level for safety and security risks, according to the Department of State website. The State Department advises the exercise of normal precautions at this level. “There is some risk in any international travel," the State Department said.,
Level 2: The State Department advises travelers to exercise “increased caution." noting that people should “be aware of heightened risks to safety and security.”
Level 3: Travelers are advised to reconsider going to countries under this level. Persons should avoid travel “due to serious risks to safety and security,” according to the Department of State website.
Level 4: This is the most severe travel advisory. Travelers are advised not to go to countries that fall under this advisory. This is due to the greater chance of life-threatening risks, the State Department said. The U.S. government also warns that during an emergency, its capacity to help citizens abroad could be severely limited. According to the State Department, these are the countries with Level 4 status, in addition to the restrictions announced for parts of Italy and South Korea on Saturday: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, China (coronavirus concerns), Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.

El muro de Trump destruye los sagrados cactus saguaros en Arizona

Texto completo: El cactus Saguaro, que puede vivir hasta 200 años, está siendo talado para dar paso al muro fronterizo del presidente Trump en Arizona, lo que provocó la indignación de los ambientalistas, activistas y líderes tribales locales, reporta weather.com.
Los saguaros son los gigantes y los ancianos del mundo de los cactus, que crecen hasta 60 pies de altura. Son reconocibles por sus brazos distintivos, que no comienzan a crecer hasta que la planta tiene unos 50 años.
Si bien no se consideran en peligro de extinción, los saguaros están protegidos por las leyes de plantas nativas de Arizona.
También es ilegal eliminarlos o a cualquier otra planta de los parques nacionales.
Pero los restos de al menos media docena de saguaros desarraigados fueron vistos este mes donde los equipos estaban destruyendo sitios en un camino de tierra a lo largo de una nueva cerca fronteriza, dentro del Monumento Nacional de Organ Pipe Cactus , a unas 150 millas al suroeste de Tucson, según Los Angeles Times.
“Algunos de ellos han estado aquí más tiempo que la frontera misma”, dijo a Los Ángeles Times Laiken Jordahl, un ex trabajador en el monumento Organ Pipe que ahora está con el Centro para la Diversidad Biológica, que ha demandado para bloquear la construcción del muro en la zona. “¿Qué derecho creemos que tenemos para destruir algo así?”
Al menos algunos de los saguaros picados fueron arrojados bajo otros escombros, también dijo L.A.Times.
Han tratado claramente de ocultar el cuerpo de este cactus”, dijo Jordahl.
Roy Villareal, jefe del sector Tucson de la Aduana y Patrulla Fronteriza de Estados Unidos, respondió a lo que llamó “información errónea” sobre el proyecto y sus impactos ambientales. Dijo que la agencia está trabajando con el Servicio de Parques Nacionales.
“Más del 90% de los cactus en el área de construcción del muro fronterizo cerca de Organ Pipe NPS fueron transportados cuidadosamente”, según un video que Villareal publicó el martes en Twitter. “Entre NPS y CBP, se salvaron más de 2,000 cactus”.
In my dozens of visits to Organ Pipe since wall construction started, I've never seen a cactus being transplanted.
Here's what's actually happening on the border: pic.twitter.com/7uPtAfNpRW
— Laiken Jordahl (@LaikenJordahl) February 25, 2020
Bill Peachy , un científico con sede en Tucson que ha estudiado y rescatado a los saguaros durante años, le dijo al LA Times que las plantas son difíciles de mover porque dependen de raíces que pueden extenderse casi 20 pies y son difíciles de restablecer después del trasplante.
Los saguaros solo crecen en el desierto de Sonora .
Si bien son comunes en Organ Pipe, el Parque Nacional Saguaro de Arizona está dedicado por completo a ellos. Las plantas tienen un alcance territorial limitado debido a su sensibilidad al frío.
Los saguaros son sagrados para el pueblo Tohono O’odham, que ocupa tierras tribales cerca del sitio de construcción. O’odham significa “saguaro” y “persona”, según el New York Times, y las leyendas tribales hablan de que las plantas son personas.
“Toda la profanación para construir este muro constituye un ataque muy personal contra nosotros”, dijo al NYT Amber Ortega, de 33 años, una estudiante de O’odham que vive cerca del monumento Organ Pipe. “¿Por qué tener leyes cuando no hay responsabilidad por estos abusos?”
Los líderes tribales también han expresado su preocupación por la perturbación de los cementerios.
El portavoz de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP), John Mennell dijo que “no se identificaron sitios biológicos, culturales o históricos dentro del área del proyecto”.
Según activistas, se están violando varias leyes federales para la construcción del muro fronterizo , incluida la Ley de Especies en Peligro de Extinción.

Texto completo: ST. LOUIS -- The St. Louis Fire Department's participation in the cable TV show "Live Rescue" was suspended this week after federal officials launched a review of patient privacy on the program.
The Fire Department received a letter Wednesday announcing that U.S. Health and Human Services was reviewing the department's partnership with the show for possible violations of federal patient privacy rules in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, commonly known as HIPAA.
The department's participation on the show will be suspended until it can meet the requirements of a compliance review, said Jacob Long, a spokesman for Mayor Lyda Krewson.
"Live Rescue" is a reality TV series that features "almost live" feeds of fire crews and emergency medical service units in seven U.S. cities.
There are pre-taped segments, but a big draw of the show is "almost live" footage of emergency responses that usually airs within about 20 minutes after it is filmed. Since the show's premiere in April, viewership has reached highs of at least 1.3 million some weeks, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The review was prompted by recent "media reports" that indicate the city is likely not in compliance with HIPAA, HHS officials told the city in a letter that arrived about three weeks after the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published a story on the show that included privacy concerns.
St. Louis resident Dana Love said in the story that she was filmed without her consent after she was injured in an October car crash.
Love was in intense back pain waiting for an EMS crew to arrive at the scene of the crash in the Southampton neighborhood. When an ambulance pulled up, she said, she saw the TV crew's lighting man and a television camera get out of the ambulance before she could spot a paramedic. Her sister began yelling for the cameras to move away, but Love said they continued filming and she remembers them following her into the ambulance as she received medical treatment.
Her segment never aired, likely because she never signed a release, St. Louis fire spokesman Garon Mosby said. Show producers said their policy dictates that they can't film people inside ambulances without patient authorization. They also won't film in a private residence without a consent form, a spokesperson for the show told the Post-Dispatch last month.
The letter from HHS asked the fire department to provide a list of information including dates and locations where the TV crews filmed. The show had crews in multiple fire units about four days a week to film for the 35 episodes that have aired since April.
HHS also asked for the number of patients that the TV crew may have filmed or overheard speaking with EMS staff and any complaints on the filming. The department has 20 days to provide the information.
Long said St. Louis fire officials believe they have stayed in compliance with HIPAA rules throughout the filming.
In a December interview with the Post-Dispatch, St. Louis fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson acknowledged there had been moments when the camera crews got too close, but he said those had all been addressed and the crews would step back as soon as a patient objected to being filmed.
"If there's ever a question of privacy, then it's no problem, that call doesn't make the show," he said.
In the department's agreement with the producers, the department agreed to assume legal responsibility for any HIPAA violation, while the show agreed to compensate the city for any legal action and carries a $1 million commercial liability insurance policy.
HIPAA violations can result in mandates to correct any privacy violations and, in some cases, a fine or settlement.
HHS, which enforces HIPAA, says in its guidelines that medical providers should not allow crews to film areas where patient information would be disclosed without prior consent. Blurring a face or disguising a voice doesn't necessarily solve the problem because HIPAA could be violated by the filming itself, according to the agency.
There have been cases where HIPAA violations related to reality TV shows resulted in payouts.
In New York, a woman named Anita Chanko was watching the medical reality show "NY Med" when she recognized footage of her husband receiving emergency surgery after he was hit by a sanitation truck. He later died from his injuries and the show never asked for her family's consent to air the material, she told The New York Times. Her husband's face was blurred but she recognized his voice and realized she was watching him die on TV.
She reached a $2.2 million settlement with the hospital.
Long, the St. Louis city spokesman, said HIPAA compliance reviews are not unusual in the city.
"St. Louis city and St. Louis Fire Department take patient privacy very seriously," Long said. "Patient privacy is paramount. 'Live Rescue' is a show that tells the story of everyday heroes, and we're proud of the way they've conducted themselves on the show."
An HHS spokesman told the Post-Dispatch on Friday that the office does not comment on open investigations. It's unclear if any other departments featured on "Live Rescue" are undergoing similar HIPAA compliance reviews, but at least one, the Sacramento Fire Department in California, had not received any similar complaints by Friday afternoon, according to fire officials there.

Texto completo: When Tina Sorg first saw the robot rolling through her Giant supermarket in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, she said to herself, "That thing is a little weird."
Programmed to detect spills and debris in the aisles, the robot looked like an inkjet printer with a long neck.
"It needed personality," said Sorg, 55, who manages the store's beer and wine department.
So, during one overnight shift, she went out to a nearby arts and craft store, brought back a large pair of googly eyes and, when no one was looking, affixed them on the top of the robot.
The eyes were a hit with executives at global grocery company Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Giant and Stop & Shop supermarket chains. They are now a standard feature on the company's nearly 500 robots across the United States.
How this supermarket robot got its goofy eyes touches on a serious question: Will robots with friendly faces and cute names help people feel good about devices that are taking over an increasing amount of human work?
Robots are now working everywhere from factories to living rooms. But the introduction of robots to public settings such as the grocery store is fueling new fears that humans are being pushed out of jobs. McKinsey, the consulting firm, says the grocers could immediately reduce "the pool of labor hours" by as much as 65% if they adopted all the automation technology available.
"Margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," McKinsey said in a report last year.
Retailers said their robot designs were not explicitly meant to assuage angst about job losses. Still, companies of all sizes are investing in tens of thousands of friendly looking robots that are quickly upending human work.
Most of the retail robots have just enough human qualities to make them appear benign but not too many to suggest they are replacing humans entirely.
Perhaps no other retailer is dealing as intensely with the sensitivities around automation as Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, with about 1.5 million workers. The company spent many months working with the company Bossa Nova and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to design a shelf-scanning robot with which it hopes employees and customers will feel comfortable.
This robot was designed without a face because its developers did not want customers to think they could interact with the device. But many of the robots have names, given to them by store staff. Some also wear name badges.
"We want the associates to have an attachment to it and want to protect it," said Sarjoun Skaff, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Bossa Nova. Walmart said it planned to deploy the robots in 1,000 stores by the end of the year, up from about 350.
At a Walmart in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania border, employees named the robot WALL-E - a choice partly inspired by the Pixar film that depicts a trash-collecting robot on a deserted planet.
The robot can work 365 days a year, scanning shelves with high-resolution cameras tabulating out-of-stock items. It takes a short break between shifts to recharge its batteries in a docking station.
Retailers say the robots are good for their workers. They free up employees from mundane and sometimes injury-prone jobs such as unloading delivery trucks to focus on more fulfilling tasks such as helping customers.

Walmsley shortens up for Olympic Marathon Trials

Texto completo: Jim Walmsley's early running success growing up in Scottsdale only minimally expanded his vision of what was possible in the sport.
Walmsley was The Republic boys high school cross country Runner of the Year in 2007 after an undefeated season for Horizon High School. He finished 23rd at the Foot Locker National Cross Country Championships.
"One of things I didn't plan enough with was looking more into collegiate and professional running then even more, so I never knew of the whole trail and ultra world," Walmsley said. "I didn't know that world really existed.
"You see in the Olympics that people are doing it as a living and making it on the professional side of things, but learning there's this whole new world of running to discover in my mid 20s changed a lot of things for me."
A discovery that might never have happened if not for serious life mistakes Walmsley made during his military commitment after finishing at the Air Force Academy in 2012.
His assignment in Montana to be a missileer, which are trained specialists who man missile systems, started badly with a driving-under-the-influence charge. Then he was involved in a cheating scandal — officers sharing answers to proficiency tests according to a recent New York Times profile — that led to his discharge after less than three years in 2015.
"The people with black marks on their records were the easier ones to separate out of the Air Force," Walmsley said. "Things all worked out at the end. I feel very fortunate to stumble into good grace of finding a good spot in life through not necessarily the easiest road, but somehow wound up here."
Now 30 and living in Flagstaff, Walmsley is a four-time Ultrarunner of the Year (2016-19). He won 2018 Western State 100-mile in a record 14 hours, 30 minutes then lowered that achievement to 14:09 in 2019, when he also set a 50-mile world record (4:50) and won the World Long Distance Mountain Running championship.
But it was Walmsley's shortest race in 2019 — a half marathon in Houston — that was the most transformative in broadening his brand, if such things matter to an ultra runner.
By finishing in 64 minutes, the exact time needed to qualify, Walmsley will be on the starting line Saturday at the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in Atlanta. Whether he has the speed over a hilly 26.2-mile course to contend for one of three men's berths at the Tokyo Olympics is the question not just throughout the running community but for Walmsley himself.
Rock 'n' Roll Arizona preview At the Humana Rock 'n' Roll Arizona half marathon Jan. 19, Walmsley lowered his personal best for 13.1 miles to 1:02.13 (although the course was found to be 970 feet short until corrected partway through the race).
"I basically accomplished the pace and the goal I wanted," he said. "At the same time, the half marathon doesn't get you to the Olympics. Really it's about dialing it in for the marathon, and it just shows at least the leg speed side of a 2:08, 2:10, 2:12 marathon is theoretically capable. But how close you can come to doubling your half marathon (best) changes for a lot of people."
It could take a sub 2:10 marathon to make the Tokyo team, although the trials have gold label status from World Athletics so Olympic qualifying standards (2:11.30 men, 2:29.30 women) are not a factor.
Men's favorites include 2016 Olympic bronze medalist Galen Rupp, who ran a 1:01.19 half marathon tune-up in Mesa on Feb. 8, 2016, and Olympians Jared Ward, Leonard Korir and Scott Fauble of Flagstaff/Northern Arizona Elite.
Tim Hutchings, an NBC analyst for the trials, said Walmsley, in his marathon debut, "might find the intensity a bit too much. If he made the top eight, it would be a fabulous run."
Walmsley might agree since his plans for 2020 include tackling Comrades Marathon (55 miles) in South Africa for the first time June 14 no matter how he fares in Atlanta. "It's bringing ultra runners into watching the marathon trials and opening the eyes for a lot of marathoners and even high school kids to see this guy getting this attention," Walmsley said. "Hopefully that can help teach other people what I didn't know when I was at that age and help inspire the next generation."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - House Democrats are scrutinizing whether President Donald Trump has improperly interfered at the Justice Department for political reasons, a prominent committee chairman said Friday, requesting documents and interviews with more than a dozen U.S. attorneys related to the cases of three Trump associates and a review of the FBI's Russia inquiry.
The requests are the first major return to politically charged oversight matters by the House Judiciary Committee since it helped impeach Trump late last year. But with House leaders intent on shifting attention toward domestic policy legislation they believe will help preserve their majority in this fall's election, it was not clear how far Democrats would be willing to escalate a likely fight.
Officials were careful Friday not to characterize the requests as the beginning of a new investigation, instead framing them as routine oversight. They come as Trump has moved aggressively in the wake of his impeachment acquittal to insert himself into Justice Department business.
"These circumstances are deeply troubling," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee chairman, wrote in a letter to William Barr, the attorney general. "Although you serve at the president's pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws. In turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility."
Nadler asked for materials related to a handful of criminal cases, including the sentencing of Roger Stone, antitrust matters and a review by John Durham into the roots of Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. Democrats believe Durham's inquiry is designed to undermine Mueller's findings.
In most of the cases under scrutiny, Trump has blurred the lines that traditionally separate the White House from criminal enforcement matters, offering running commentary or outright rooting for a result on Twitter and in public comments. Documentary records and interviews with prosecutors could definitively show whether the department acted based on Trump's statements or if the White House at any point issued more direct orders in private.
In the case of Stone, the president's remarks on Twitter blasting the judge and Justice Department lawyers for recommending what he said was too harsh a sentence for his longtime friend and campaign adviser went so far that Barr delivered an extraordinary public rebuke, but only after senior department officials intervened to reverse the recommendation of career prosecutors and suggest a shorter sentence.
The attorney general said earlier this month that he would not be "bullied" into any result and warned that the president's tweets made it "impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."
Although tensions have eased somewhat in recent weeks, Barr remains in a precarious position. Trump has largely defied his request, continuing to tweet about the Stone case and forcing Barr to contemplate what it would take for him to resign. The Judiciary Committee's scrutiny could only make things more difficult for the attorney general, whose actions have drawn intense criticism inside and outside the Justice Department for politicizing the law enforcement system.
Nadler cited those tensions as he asked for the materials by mid-March so the committee could study the matter before a planned hearing with Barr on March 31.
If history is any guide, though, the exchange will not be an easy one. The department generally opposes handing over files related to ongoing matters, especially to lawmakers of another party, though it has made exceptions. And Nadler and Barr have particularly bad blood, stemming from the attorney general's handling of the special counsel's investigation.

Texto completo: When Tina Sorg first saw the robot rolling through her Giant supermarket in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, she said to herself, "That thing is a little weird."
Programmed to detect spills and debris in the aisles, the robot looked like an inkjet printer with a long neck.
"It needed personality," said Sorg, 55, who manages the store's beer and wine department.
So, during one overnight shift, she went out to a nearby arts and craft store, brought back a large pair of googly eyes and, when no one was looking, affixed them on the top of the robot.
The eyes were a hit with executives at global grocery company Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Giant and Stop & Shop supermarket chains. They are now a standard feature on the company's nearly 500 robots across the United States.
How this supermarket robot got its goofy eyes touches on a serious question: Will robots with friendly faces and cute names help people feel good about devices that are taking over an increasing amount of human work?
Robots are now working everywhere from factories to living rooms. But the introduction of robots to public settings such as the grocery store is fueling new fears that humans are being pushed out of jobs. McKinsey, the consulting firm, says the grocers could immediately reduce "the pool of labor hours" by as much as 65% if they adopted all the automation technology available.
"Margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," McKinsey said in a report last year.
Retailers said their robot designs were not explicitly meant to assuage angst about job losses. Still, companies of all sizes are investing in tens of thousands of friendly looking robots that are quickly upending human work.
Most of the retail robots have just enough human qualities to make them appear benign but not too many to suggest they are replacing humans entirely.
Perhaps no other retailer is dealing as intensely with the sensitivities around automation as Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, with about 1.5 million workers. The company spent many months working with the company Bossa Nova and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to design a shelf-scanning robot with which it hopes employees and customers will feel comfortable.
This robot was designed without a face because its developers did not want customers to think they could interact with the device. But many of the robots have names, given to them by store staff. Some also wear name badges.
"We want the associates to have an attachment to it and want to protect it," said Sarjoun Skaff, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Bossa Nova. Walmart said it planned to deploy the robots in 1,000 stores by the end of the year, up from about 350.
At a Walmart in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania border, employees named the robot WALL-E - a choice partly inspired by the Pixar film that depicts a trash-collecting robot on a deserted planet.
The robot can work 365 days a year, scanning shelves with high-resolution cameras tabulating out-of-stock items. It takes a short break between shifts to recharge its batteries in a docking station.
Retailers say the robots are good for their workers. They free up employees from mundane and sometimes injury-prone jobs such as unloading delivery trucks to focus on more fulfilling tasks such as helping customers.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Friday he had not been arrested in apartheid South Africa when visiting Nelson Mandela in prison in the 1970s, despite previously saying so on the campaign trail.
"I said arrested. I meant I was not able to move," he told CNN. "I guess I wasn't arrested. I was stopped. I wasn't able to go where I wanted to go."
His correction to the story caps off a controversy over the origins of an account fact-checkers at the Washington Post had called "ridiculous."
"I had the great honor of meeting him," Biden said while campaigning in South Carolina, according to a New York Times story this month. "I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him."
Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, later told reporters the story had referred to the trip in the 1970s and that he "was separated from his party at the airport."
In amending his account in Friday's CNN interview, Biden, a long-time former senator, said he had been visiting South Africa with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, when the "Afrikaners" with "their short pants and their guns" made him get off the plane and moved him in a "different direction" from the rest of the delegation.
According to Biden, South African officials wanted him and the black lawmakers in the delegation to go through two separate doors, but "I made it clear I wasn't going to move," and the officials eventually decided to take all of the lawmakers together to the baggage claim.
Biden faces a crucial test in the South Carolina primary, where his campaign hopes for a big win after disappointing showings in the first three nomination contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

Dem candidates peddle papers for endorsements

Texto completo: Do political endorsements by newspapers have much impact? It was debatable even back in the 1980s, when daily circulation stood at about 63 million nationwide, and it's even more uncertain now that the number has dropped by more than half. But while some people study polls, I watch editorial pages for insight about this vexing Democratic presidential race.
Pete Buttigieg had not received a single endorsement from a daily newspaper until a few days ago when he picked up backing of the San Diego Union-Tribune and then, just days before the Feb. 29 primary, he was endorsed by The State, South Carolina's second largest paper. The former South Bend, Ind., mayor has struggled to gain support from African American voters — the majority in South Carolina. Yet, in backing him The State noted that Democrats have succeeded when they "resisted the temptation to pick status-quo nominees and shown the courage to choose centrist outsiders with fresh, optimistic messages." Days later Buttigieg was endorsed in Texas by the El Paso Times.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar trails badly in national presidential polls, but she's in first place when it comes to wining support of newspapers. According to my count, of 18 paid-circulation dailies to make endorsements to date, she has been the choice of 10.
In New Hampshire's primary Klobuchar finished a surprising third — closer to first than to fourth — and generated over $12 million in contributions. It didn't hurt that in the closing days she was endorsed by the state's Seacoast Media Group, the Keene Sentinel, and New Hampshire's largest paper, the Manchester Union Leader.
"The Democratic nominee needs to have a proven and substantial record of accomplishment across party lines," wrote the Union Leader, citing Klobuchar's "ability to unite rather than divide, and the strength and stamina to go toe-to-toe with the Tweeter-in-Chief."
Her earliest endorsement — and perhaps the most valuable — came from The New York Times on Jan. 19. Although the paper split its support between Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, it called Klobuchar "the standard-bearer for the Democratic center." The editorial praised her as "the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit and sticktoitiveness."
In Iowa, Warren was endorsed by the state's largest paper, the Des Moines Register, and less than a week before Super Tuesday she was endorsed in her home state by the Boston Globe. The paper cited Warren "as a leader with the qualifications, the track record, and the tenacity to defend the principles of democracy, bring fairness to an economy that is excluding too many Americans, and advance a progressive agenda."
There hasn't been a lot of research regarding the value of print endorsements, but back in 2008 Pew found that only 14 percent of readers indicated that a local newspaper endorsement would be likely to have a positive influence on their votes. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was endorsed by 55 of the nation's 60 largest papers making endorsements, yet Donald Trump got the last laugh.
However, the more candidates there are in a race, as is the case in current primaries, the more voters pay at least some attention to newspaper recommendations. Editorial boards are able to interview the candidates at length and scrutinize their records and proposals in a way that average voters would find almost impossible to replicate.
As the 2020 campaign moved to Nevada for caucuses on Feb. 22, Klobuchar, along with Joe Biden, picked up the endorsement of the Las Vegas Sun. Klobuchar "possesses both the appetite and ability to return us to our finest America," the paper wrote. "We have no doubt that she is a unity candidate for the Democrats."
On Super Tuesday the two biggest states in play are California and Texas. The San Francisco Chronicle as well as The San Jose Mercury News, powerful voices in the Bay Area and in Silicon Valley, endorsed Klobuchar. The Mercury News called her "someone who can change the tone and tenor of our national politics." In Texas, she received backing from The Houston Chronicle, which concluded, "It's time for Democrats to look beyond fiery speeches, beyond big ticket promises devoid of price tags, and if possible, beyond the cinematic beckoning of that billionaire button-down Messiah stalking your smartphone, and ask: Who can really get things done?"
I'm convinced that newspaper endorsements — distributed widely by campaign operatives — carry weight that goes beyond paid circulation. In the current race, many Democrats are torn and thirsting for persuasive rationale.
One caveat to the above: News organizations should never issue a split endorsement, as The Times and Sun have done this year. It's cowardly. Moreover, it shirks the very responsibility that editorial boards are taking on in the first place. Don't give us 2,000-words of analysis and then conclude by saying we should flip a coin.
But what if I'm mistaken and few people care about newspaper endorsements? OK, then let's think of these editorial boards not as influencers but as early deciders. They're looking at the same field that we're all studying — only sooner in the process and in greater detail. Perhaps their "votes" are prescient.
Editorial boards are nearly unanimous in advocating a center-left choice, not an ultra-progressive. That view might yet be worth more than the paper it's written on.

Newspaper endorsements don't carry the same political weight as they used to, but with such a crowded field of Democratic contenders such honors might help the candidates distinguish themselves from each other.

El brote viral afecta a los restaurantes chinos

Texto completo: Si bien los restaurantes chinos en los barrios chinos de todo el país están reportando una disminución en el flujo de clientes tras el brote del coronavirus, los restaurantes chinos de Salinas no están viendo la misma cantidad de mesas vacías.
En los barrios chinos de San Francisco, Nueva York y otras ciudades algunos restaurantes dicen que han perdido del 50 % al 70 % de sus ventas debido al nuevo coronavirus, también conocido como COVID-19, informó el New York Times.
Sin embargo, quienes son propietarios y operan restaurantes chinos en Salinas dicen que han observado una ligera desaceleración, pero todavía no están preocupados por sus negocios.
Daisey Tan es una de las propietarias de Cantonese Express Food, un restaurante chino en el sur de Salinas que ha estado en funcionamiento durante más de una década. Recientemente pasó tiempo cerca de la entrada hacia la cocina, empacando y anunciando órdenes de comida para llevar.
"¿Pollo a la naranja?", les preguntó a dos hombres que estaban sentados en la mesa del frente con sus rostros ocupados viendo sus teléfonos.
El coronavirus preocupa a la propietaria Aunque Daisey dice que su negocio atrae principalmente a la clientela habitual que no ha cambiado sus hábitos debido al brote de coronavirus en China, le preocupa que la gente asocie al restaurante de su familia con el coronavirus.
Se asegura de señalar las reseñas enmarcadas del restaurante, las cuales están junto a los informes firmados con sello dorado del Departamento de Salud del Condado de Monterey para los años 2018 y 2020.
"Preparamos buena comida", dijo.
La clientela habitual comparte esa opinión.
Gus Martínez, quien vive en el sur de Salinas, ha venido a Cantonese Food Express por el pollo picante con ejotes desde que su hija, quien en ese entonces asistía a la preparatoria, lo llevó al restaurante por primera vez.
"Me encanta el lugar", dijo el Sr. Martínez, mencionando la comida y la amabilidad del personal como las razones de ello. Evitar uno de sus restaurantes favoritos debido al coronavirus nunca le pasó por la mente, dijo.
Kevin Tan, sobrino de Daisey, prepara alimentos en la cocina y administra el negocio.
"Podemos notar que a la hora del almuerzo el restaurante no se llena tanto como antes", dijo, recargándose en la pared junto al pizarrón que tiene los especiales del almuerzo escritos con marcador.
Sin embargo, siendo visitante regular del Área de la Bahía, dijo que la caída de las ventas en Salinas no se compara con lo que ha visto en los barrios chinos al norte de aquí, donde las tiendas y los restaurantes están vacíos.
"Los ingresos, el alquiler, los empleados", dijo Kevin. "Eso es lo primero por lo que nos preocupamos".
Hemos experimentado una ligera disminución en nuestros ingresos, dijo Kevin, pero es algo sostenible. Si esto se mantiene así durante tres o cuatro meses, comentó, el restaurante podría verse en la necesidad revisar algunos de sus gastos.
Otro restaurante observa una tendencia similar Del otro lado de la plaza frente al Cantonese Food Express, Rudy Lee, el gerente de AA Buffet, dijo que ha observado algo similar. Aunque la clientela habitual sigue viniendo con gusto para comprar un boleto para el buffet, "recibimos menos turistas", explicó.
"Pero los locales son prácticamente los mismos", agregó el Sr. Lee.
Las ventas no son lo único en la mente del Sr. Lee.
Si bien las familias de sus empleados se encuentran en los EE. UU., el Sr. Lee, quien es originario de Taiwán, dijo que le preocupan sus amigos que viven por toda Asia. Aunque ha vivido en los EE. UU. durante diez años, sigue teniendo fuertes lazos con personas de Corea, Japón, Tailandia y otros lugares, y esto lo ha estado preocupando.
Paul Farmer, director general de la Cámara de Comercio del Valle de Salinas, no había escuchado sobre alguna pérdida en las ventas atribuible al coronavirus por parte de los asociados de la cámara.
"Sería un poco extraño", dijo el Sr. Farmer. "Obviamente habrá repercusiones secundarias en cuanto a cómo esto está afectando a las economías de Europa, China y del mundo; así que eso nos afectará de forma indirecta".
"Personalmente, diría que en nuestra sociedad tendemos a concentrarnos demasiado en ciertos problemas", dijo el Sr. Farmer. "Por ejemplo, muchos dicen que la gripe está matando a muchas más personas y que es un peligro más claro y real que el coronavirus, sin embargo, debido a que la gripe siempre está presente, la gente la está ignorando".
¿Qué hay sobre la gripe? Los estadounidenses tienen más probabilidades de morir a causa de la gripe que del coronavirus. Ha habido 22 millones de casos de gripe, que han causado 210,000 hospitalizaciones y 12,000 fallecimientos en lo que va de la temporada, de acuerdo con los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades de los Estados Unidos.
La gran mayoría de los más de 60,000 casos confirmados de coronavirus y, al menos 1,370 fallecimientos, han ocurrido en la provincia china de Hubei.
Fuera de China continental, ha habido al menos 570 casos confirmados en 25 países y territorios, y tres fallecimientos: uno en las Filipinas, uno en Hong Kong y uno en Japón.
En los EE. UU., 15 personas han dado positivo para el virus: ocho en California, dos en Illinois, uno en Massachusetts, uno en Arizona, uno en Wisconsin, uno en Texas y uno en el estado de Washington, donde ya se dio de alta al paciente. La mayoría de los casos en los EE. UU. involucran a personas que visitaron Wuhan, donde en diciembre se reportaron los primeros casos.
Spenser Smith es miembro de la cámara a través de su negocio, ARCPoint labs of Monterey Bay, una compañía que realiza pruebas de sangre. El Sr. Smith, quien es mitad chino, les ha estado enviando a sus abuelos en Taiwán suministros médicos que comienzan a escasear allá, como guantes o cubrebocas.
Tuvo que posponer un viaje a la isla para visitar a sus abuelos maternos durante el brote, después de que le dijeron que se sentirían más seguros si no los visitaba.
Aunque el Sr. Smith no ha sido testigo de casos de evidente categorización racial a nivel local (personas que evitan ir a restaurantes chinos por miedo a contraer el coronavirus, por ejemplo) sí ha visto cómo algunas acusaciones en línea en contra de Panda Express se han vuelto virales.
"Es algo enfermizo", dijo sobre la gente que trata de usar el miedo al coronavirus para hacerse publicidad ellos mismos o a su marca.
"Al ser asiático, se da un tipo diferente de estereotipo racial", dijo el Sr. Smith. "Es tan diferente de las cosas que escuchas sobre la categorización que hace la policía de otros grupos, que trato de no ser demasiado sensible cuando le ocurre a mi categoría racial".
Aun así, dijo el Sr. Smith, evitar los restaurantes chinos podría no ser algo que la gente esté haciendo conscientemente.
"Es algo tonto y sin sentido, pero ocurre, y no siempre es algo evidente. Si te dan la opción y eso te recuerda esa situación, simplemente te alejas".

Texto completo: After the Iowa Caucus in February, a reporter at CNN contacted Darren Linvill, a Clemson University professor, about a tweet he thought had come from a Russian troll, or agent of the Russian state who uses fake social media accounts to influence and engage with Americans.
"An account had retweeted an NBC tweet from three elections ago when (Joe) Biden had dropped out of the election," Linvill said. "But when you retweet it, most people don't look at the date, they just see that Biden has dropped out of the election."
In 2008, then-Senator Joe Biden ran as a Democratic candidate for president before joining nominee Barack Obama's ticket as vice president.
Eventually, the tweet began to make its way around the social media platform.
"And so thousands of people were thinking that Biden dropped out of the (2020) election because of this one person."
Linvill said he analyzed the tweet – one of the thousands he's looked at for his research on social media disinformation – to see if the account belonged to a Russian troll.
"It was clearly just some 'Bernie bro' trying to be cute," he said, referencing the moniker for Sen. Bernie Sanders young, internet-savvy male supporters.
"I think a lot of people misconstrue social media trolls, or at least the professional trolls. I mean, we all know most trolls on social media are just ... jerks," Linvill said.
But sometimes, the trolls are professional and hired by Russia, China or Iran to spread influence, news and agendas to the millions of Americans on dozens of social media platforms.
Linvill and his research partner, Patrick Warren, study how state-sponsored disinformation visibly influences American politics and ideologies through social media. Linvill and Warren work with Twitter, journalists and sometimes Facebook to identify troll accounts and shut them down.
The goal of these accounts is to drive America apart, to "further entrench" Americans into their ideological silos, which makes compromise and civility harder to maintain, Linvill explained.
"You can't compromise with somebody you're disgusted with – if they are less than human. If your beliefs are disgusting to me, then you're not even worth talking to. You have to be defeated, not compromised with, and then government breaks down."
Here's how the Trolls operate: 'They're pretending to be your friend'
The fake accounts tweet mundane, positive things, often becoming a part of an online community, Linvill said. But for every 50 happy or funny messages they tweet, a troll account might send one or two extreme or radical messages.
"The professionals aren't trying to be your enemy. They're not trying to make you angry," Linvill said. "They're pretending to be your friend. And they do that in order to entrench people in the most extreme ideologies and to make those extreme ideologies appear more prevalent than they are in real life."
Spinning the headlines
The trolls don't typically spread "fake news," as many people think, Linvill said. Instead, they spread real news in a slanted way.
"So they link to a lot of articles from CNN or the New York Times, but when they make the post, they're telling you how you need to think about that article. So they're priming you before you even go to the link."
The also try to spin public perception of activists groups.
The Post & Courier reported last month that Russia, under the guise of a civil rights group Black Matters US, attempted to stage a rally in front of the Charleston AME Church where a white supremacist had fatally shot nine Black churchgoers that same year.
Pretty girls, veterans and people of color
To spread their influence, Linvill said the trolls use demographics that conservatives and liberals find most influential.
"Being a black woman is very effective on Twitter for a lot of reasons," he said. Because the trolls can hide behind these personas many people trust, they are able to wield more influence, Linvill explained.
The trolls also use highly professional marketing techniques to sell their influence, much like advertising agencies.
"Professional trolls use techniques that were first developed by Madison Avenue PR and marketing firms ... they sell ideology in the same way the Budweiser sells beer – with pretty girls and veterans."
Russians 'making a bad problem worse' On Feb. 19, President Donald Trump attended a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, while his Democratic challengers took the debate stage in Nevada.
Breitbart News, a right-leaning media company, wrote that Trump spoke about his triumphs with international trade, fighting against illegal immigration and "keeping America great."
The article is titled "Trump in Phoenix: 'The Great Betrayal Is Over,' 'America Is no Longer for Sale'"
HuffPost, a left-leaning media site, recapped the rally in a much different tone in their article titled, "Trump Brings Normal Fare Of Rambling Boasts And Falsehoods To Arizona Rally."
The article refutes many of the claims Pres. Trump makes about the economy, the 2016 election and health care.
The two news stories present totally different recollections of what happened inside the Veterans Memorial Coliseum that night.
"America is absolutely two completely different worlds getting their news from completely different sources that spin a completely different version of what reality actually is," said Linvill.
"The Russians are just making a bad problem worse," he said.
Linvill said he doesn't think America will be further divided by another Russian email hack or troll account from China, but from our own political campaigns.
"The campaigns work to make these echo chambers worse, especially the Trump campaign. But I mean, everybody does it to some extreme. And certain media outlets ... give Americans a particular view of the world that keeps them loyal to a particular ideology."
"And it's going to destroy our country."

Amid virus fear, Olympians keep calm, carry on

Texto completo: Like any successful swimmer, Mallory Comerford has learned to stay in her lane.
The former University of Louisville freestyle star — three times the NCAA champion at 200 meters — continues to train for the Tokyo Olympics as if the Summer Games will go on as scheduled. She expressed confidence that the United States Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee will make the right calls concerning coronavirus.
She is inclined to makes waves only in the water.
"I personally am not worrying about the health concerns leading up to Tokyo," Comerford said. "I know and trust that the USOC has the athletes' best interest in mind when making decisions with the IOC.
"My goal this summer is the same as it always has been — just trying to get a little bit better each day. I am very, very fortunate to be in the position I am and am just enjoying swimming every day as my job."
One of the qualities that separate world-class athletes from others with similar physical skills is the ability to concentrate on the task at hand when external events are conducive to distraction. One of their more common claims/evasions is that they don't worry about things beyond their control.
Yet with the coronavirus not yet contained, and the Tokyo Games less than five months away, even some of the most laser-focused Olympians are understandably anxious.
"I would most definitely be concerned," five-time gold medalist Ian Thorpe told reporters in Australia on Thursday. "What we need to know is to use some of the best expert disease specialists to find out what is the risk to the team. What is the risk to the other nations and how can we have an Olympic Games, one that is safe, that doesn't put athletes at risk?"
Calculating July's risks in February entails an equation with multiple variables, of course, but Olympic organizers will be obliged to make a call long before the Opening Ceremonies. Canadian Dick Pound, the longest-serving member of the IOC, estimated earlier this week that advance preparations for an event of this scale would mean a decision on whether to go forward would need to be made by late May.
"I'm sure somewhere within the walls of the IOC headquarters there's a big board with various scenarios on it where people are thinking about, 'OK, what do we do in a worst-case situation?' " Pound told the New York Times.
Though both the IOC and Tokyo organizers quickly countered Pound's comments — IOC President Thomas Bach said he's "fully committed" to holding the Games on schedule – their happy talk did not prevent Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe from requesting the country's schools be closed for more than a month as of Monday as a precaution.
Nor did it dissuade London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey from issuing a campaign Tweet Wednesday to the effect that Britain has the "infrastructure and the experience" to serve as a late substitute should Tokyo prove an untenable host.
Official statements notwithstanding, the situation is obviously fluid and enormously delicate. Beyond the financial investment and image concerns of the host country, NBC paid $1.45 billion for broadcast rights to the 2020 Games. The network is launching its streaming platform, Peacock, just nine days before the Games' scheduled start on July 24.
The Paralympic Games, for athletes with disabilities, are to be staged in Tokyo following the Olympic Games, from Aug. 25 to Sept. 6.
"I certainly hope they aren't cancelled," Louisville-based paralympian Oksana Masters told the Courier Journal's Kirby Adams. "I am continuing to train for the summer paralympics as if they will continue as planned."
University of Kentucky rifle team members Will Shaner and Mary Tucker, who qualified for the U.S. Olympic team earlier this month, both declined interview requests about their coronavirus concerns.
"They said it's something out of their control and they don't want to spend any time thinking about it right now," a university spokesman said.
Unlike most major sports events, the Olympic Games are conducted only once every four years. For many athletes, it is literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience, one that requires years of single-minded training.
To date, only World Wars have caused the Olympic Games to be cancelled. Elite athletes are not easily discouraged.

'American Dirt' controversy: Who can tell our stories?

Texto completo: "Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands ... senses, affections, passions? ... If you prick us, do we not bleed?" These words, spoken by Shylock in Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice," call us to recognize our shared humanity. Perhaps they have never been more important than they are today.
The demands from online trenches, insisting that only people of a specific race or culture may write about those groups as discussed by Leonard Pitts in his column, (The Morning Call, Feb.14), regarding the novel by Jeanine Cummins, would be laughable if they weren't lethal.
Are women never to write about men? Men never to write about nature? Children never write fairy stories? Are we each to remain in the narrow confines of our ancestry, color, gender and experience; never allowed to express thoughts about other human beings?
If an Anglo woman can be savaged and threatened for daring to write about Latinos, perhaps I'd be scorned for writing a sympathy note to someone because I didn't experience that specific loss. The extent to which this madness can be stretched is bottomless. Surely, this is the steepest of slopes, down which we would all fall to our intellectual and spiritual deaths.
Telling people that they cannot write is telling them that they cannot think, feel, imagine or create; cannot live as sentient beings. It kills what makes us human.
If this literary lynch mob had existed in Shakespeare's time, we'd have none of his works, because he was never a Scottish king, a shrewish woman, an Italian teenager or Julius Caesar. When Harriet Beecher Stowe, a white woman, wrote "Uncle Tom's Cabin," she spotlighted slavery's horrors and galvanized a nation. Arthur Miller wasn't a poor peddler when he wrote "Death of a Salesman," but the story of Willy Loman has profoundly opened minds and touched hearts.
After my own book was published, an older man said to me, "We were poor. We were immigrants. We were South Siders. We didn't matter. But now, you've written this book. You made the South Side matter. You made us matter. You made me matter. For the first time in my life, I matter."
He reached out to embrace me, tears streaming down his face. I returned his hug, letting my own tears come. Should I not have written my stories because I wasn't a man, a foundry laborer or a Polish immigrant?
Perhaps it isn't surprising that this attempt to shackle the human mind and voice has arisen at a time when some deny that anyone was killed at the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, while others blindly believe claims of pizza parlor pedophilia. This is a time when courageous military personnel are demoted and denounced for telling the truth, while the nation's highest civilian honor is given to someone associated with thought pollution as well as control. The time is apparently ripe for an absurdist attempt to prevent people from writing, speaking, thinking.
Shylock's words in Shakespeare's play are bookended by Portia's words. She acknowledges Shylock's claims but begs for something beyond the precision of fact: mercy. Simple mercy. "The quality of mercy is not strained," she says. "... it is twice-blessed - It blesseth him that gives and him that takes ... It is an attribute to God himself."
Between the twin pillars of Shylock's wisdom - we are all human - and Portia's insight - have mercy - let us find the resolve to stop today's many descents into madness. If we reaffirm our God-given right to see, hear, feel and express life, perhaps the day will come when mass media, popular writing, and even the corridors of Washington, D.C. will abound with people of whom we need not be ashamed ... or afraid.

If robots only had eyes for you Personality boosts may be offset by workers still wary of job-stealing bots

Texto completo: When Tina Sorg first saw the robot rolling through her Giant supermarket in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, she said to herself, "That thing is a little weird."
Programmed to detect spills and debris in the aisles, the robot looked like an inkjet printer with a long neck.
"It needed personality," said Sorg, 55, who manages the store's beer and wine department.
So, during one overnight shift, she went out to a nearby arts and craft store, brought back a large pair of googly eyes and, when no one was looking, affixed them on the top of the robot.
The eyes were a hit with executives at global grocery company Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Giant and Stop & Shop supermarket chains. They are now a standard feature on the company's nearly 500 robots across the United States.
How this supermarket robot got its goofy eyes touches on a serious question: Will robots with friendly faces and cute names help people feel good about devices that are taking over an increasing amount of human work?
Robots are now working everywhere from factories to living rooms. But the introduction of robots to public settings such as the grocery store is fueling new fears that humans are being pushed out of jobs. McKinsey, the consulting firm, says the grocers could immediately reduce "the pool of labor hours" by as much as 65% if they adopted all the automation technology available.
"Margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," McKinsey said in a report last year.
Retailers said their robot designs were not explicitly meant to assuage angst about job losses. Still, companies of all sizes are investing in tens of thousands of friendly looking robots that are quickly upending human work.
Most of the retail robots have just enough human qualities to make them appear benign but not too many to suggest they are replacing humans entirely.
Perhaps no other retailer is dealing as intensely with the sensitivities around automation as Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, with about 1.5 million workers. The company spent many months working with the company Bossa Nova and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to design a shelf-scanning robot with which it hopes employees and customers will feel comfortable.
This robot was designed without a face because its developers did not want customers to think they could interact with the device. But many of the robots have names, given to them by store staff. Some also wear name badges.
"We want the associates to have an attachment to it and want to protect it," said Sarjoun Skaff, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Bossa Nova. Walmart said it planned to deploy the robots in 1,000 stores by the end of the year, up from about 350.
At a Walmart in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania border, employees named the robot WALL-E - a choice partly inspired by the Pixar film that depicts a trash-collecting robot on a deserted planet.
The robot can work 365 days a year, scanning shelves with high-resolution cameras tabulating out-of-stock items. It takes a short break between shifts to recharge its batteries in a docking station.
Retailers say the robots are good for their workers. They free up employees from mundane and sometimes injury-prone jobs such as unloading delivery trucks to focus on more fulfilling tasks such as helping customers.

Texto completo: Growing up in California, Orion Tait used to watch his father's weekend housekeeping routine.
"Sunday was loud music - Neil Young - and my dad going around watering the plants," Tait recalled. "He had a deck of plants growing everywhere. It was a ritual."
Tait, a creative director and partner at Buck, a production company, tried to carry on that tradition as an adult in his Brooklyn home, complete with the loud rock. But he and his wife, Amy Won, were too busy to care for their houseplants. They never got around to repotting them. Fungus gnats colonized.
"I was, like, this is New York City," Tait said. "There's got to be someone we can hire."
That someone was Lisa Muñoz. For $2,000, Muñoz will come fill your house with plants and make it look beautiful. You can spend more than $2,000, but you cannot spend less; that's the minimum fee charged by her Brooklyn-based firm, Leaf and June.
That covers the design, plants, potting, delivery of plants and a detailed care guide, Muñoz said. "You don't have to call an Uber XL to transport your big tree home," she said. "We do all the dirty work for you."
If Muñoz, 38, sounds practiced at selling her services, it's because her job title - interior plant designer - usually requires explanation. It's an emerging career; she has been doing it for six years.
Nurseries and flower shops have long provided professional plant care for offices and homes. Muñoz offers such maintenance services to her clients too.
But her real role is in performing the job that a fashion stylist or art consultant might - to make aesthetic choices and sound investments on someone's behalf. Just ... about plants.
The fascination with houseplants has begun to spawn all manner of specialists.
After he began posting photos of his Baltimore home to Instagram three years ago, and talking about the 200 plants that fill the lush rooms, Hilton Carter became a bit of a celebrity. He published a book, "Wild at Home: How to Style and Care for Beautiful Plants," and, he says, created a new occupation.
"I'm not going to lie to you - I believe I was the first person to ever say I was a plant stylist," said Carter, 40, who worked at an ad agency before dedicating himself to houseplants. "I just ran with it. That's awesome that it's now a job title."
These days, Carter is too busy with his other plant gigs (he has a new book coming out this spring, "Wild Interiors," with a promotional tour to follow) to do much styling, he said.
Maryah Greene, who runs the one-woman firm Greene Piece, bills herself as New York City's "Plant Doctor & Stylist." She is the fiddle-leaf-fig whisperer for the rest of us: She charges a flat hourly rate of between $125 and $175. Her clients are largely renters who want to introduce a little greenery into their lives but don't know a pothos plant from a bird of paradise, much less how to not kill them.
"A lot of what I do I like to think of as confidence boosting," said Greene, 24, who has plant-styled for more than a year and has met with about 50 clients so far.
The confidence they crave requires counsel: Will a monstera be happy by the radiator? Can sunshine-loving cactuses thrive in a light-starved apartment? What's the best pot to show off the pink and white leaves of hoya carnosa?
More plant money,
more plant problems
One wonders why a plant stylist is needed in the first place. The library is still free.
Yet in the age of the gig economy, where freelancers and consultants exist to fulfill every life need, and hiring out a task can be preferable to learning how to do it yourself, houseplant decisions are just another thing to outsource.
The plant stylists say most people's ability to properly choose and care for houseplants is woeful, even as the reported desire to live among them is high.
"One of the biggest questions I get from clients is, 'What plant can I get that would be good with no light?' " Muñoz said. "No light? That's actually not possible."
John Fraser, a chef, hired Muñoz to rescue his neglected houseplants, which "were on death's door," and to create a potted greenscape on the balcony of his apartment. "I wanted someone who could give me the answers that you probably learn over time," he said. "Because of travel and restaurant stuff, I'm not the best caretaker."
Meeting with a plant stylist is "a really intimate service," Greene said, and thus caters to the still would-be plant parent. "I can't provide you with the right plants unless I know who you are, what your work schedule is like, your history with plants."
No doctorate required
A four-year degree in horticulture or botany isn't necessary to style plants. Greene was earning her master's in education and literacy and hanging around plant shops when she realized she could make money from her hobby.
In 2013, Muñoz earned her certificate in horticulture from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and began working part time at plant shops to further educate herself. Her business was born in 2014.
Muñoz recently installed 115 potted plants in Buck's large, light-filled offices overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront, at the behest of Tait and his partners. Soon after, she said, the company asked for a proposal to add more plants.
"I think people are really just wanting things that make them happy. And things that are alive ... ," Muñoz said, trailing off.
She considered her curious role. "I mean, have you ever heard of plants making people mad?"

Campaign leftovers settle in dustbin When political run ends, swag usually recycled or trashed

Texto completo: Buttons, shirts and bumper stickers heralding the failed presidential ambitions of Sen. Kamala Harris are gathering dust inside a warehouse in Texas.
Among lava lamps and incense sticks, a retailer in Connecticut still offers shirts that cry "Jeb!"
And for years after Mitt Romney's 2012 quest for the White House ended, fading campaign hats and shirts resurfaced on the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
For decades, U.S. presidential campaigns have churned out enormous quantities of swag - $5 buttons, $15 mugs, $75 guacamole bowls - to promote candidates, fill campaign coffers and gather sophisticated data about supporters.
Less attention has been paid, however, to what happens to all those things after most of those campaigns end, sometimes abruptly.
Many campaigns do not have a plan for what they leave behind.
"You literally go from building a multimillion-dollar startup to being shut down overnight," said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 campaign, which gave many leftover shirts to volunteers. "It's a lot easier to have people help you when you win to shut down a campaign."
Surplus items often end up in storage or in the homes of staff members and volunteers. Some are given a second life with a new campaign. Most are thought to be recycled or thrown away.
"If somebody doesn't deliberately collect them or hold on to them, almost all of it disappears," said Jon Grinspan, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History who collects presidential campaign memorabilia for the museum.
The Harris campaign placed a bulk order for merchandise in the summer, said Shelby Cole, who was digital director of Harris' campaign. The plan was to distribute the items to campaign teams nationwide. But before they could, Harris, a senator from California, dropped out.
"All of our staff was pretty much caught by total surprise," Cole said. "I was just thinking, 'Oh my God, what are we going to do with all these shirts?' "
Cole said that the vendor the Harris campaign had hired, Bumperactive, offered to store the items in a warehouse and that they had been there for months. The merchandise is not marked with the year 2020, so it could in theory be used for Harris' future campaigns, Cole said.
Harris' office said there were plans to recycle the items but offered no specifics. Kyle Johnson, owner of Bumperactive, declined to comment.
At times, vendors that print shirts and other items are left with the surplus stock. The retailer in Connecticut, Old Glory, still offers items printed for Jeb Bush, John McCain and other bygone candidates.
"It's just in our warehouse, sitting on a shelf," said Austin Braumann, a district manager for Old Glory. "What ends up happening is you either leave it up online and you can sell it, or you can donate it or throw it away."
Several hundred shirts and hats promoting Romney's 2012 presidential campaign wound up in Kenya after a former county campaign director in Tennessee donated the items to a charity run by his aunt.
The former campaign official, Alexander Waters, recalled thinking after the election, "Instead of someone selling them on eBay for $5 down the road, how can we turn this boon into something that can change someone's life?"
In 2013, Waters delivered the clothes to his aunt's charity, the Orbit Village Project, which has been operating in Kenya for more than 20 years. His aunt, Cyndy Waters, said she saw people wearing Romney hats for years.
"Kenyans are very much in tune to what's going on in American elections, so they knew Romney," she said.
Jason Worrix, marketing director for My Campaign Store, a company in Louisville, Kentucky, said he advises that leftover goods be donated to local organizations. Signs can be painted over by Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, pens can go to bars and restaurants, clothing to shelters or Goodwill.
Sometimes, campaigns reuse the material, Worrix said. Small changes can turn a yard sign for a congressional campaign into a yard sign promoting a run for governor or president, he said, and if a T-shirt or mug shows only a candidate's name, it can be reused every election cycle.
"Politicians, a lot of times they're lifers," he said. "Especially for yard signs and things, we print a lot of stickers that say 'reelect,' or cover up positions and years to modify what they're running for."
But there is no consistent practice of giving to charity, as the NFL does with the premade, "winning" merchandise of teams that lose in the Super Bowl.
Some campaigns keep their stores open; sales can help pay the bills or generate income to finance a future race. Zach Graumann, campaign manager for Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who ended his long-shot bid for president last month, said Yang merchandise would remain available until whatever was left sold out.
The National Museum of American History has about 130,000 items that showcase American political history, most of which came from campaigns. Grinspan, who has been a curator at the museum for five years, said that snagging items before they got tossed could be a challenge and that "99%" of items were thrown away.
Sometimes, collecting can mean sifting through recycling bins or piles of discarded material. In most cases, volunteers and staff members willingly share campaign merchandise.
Curators gathered a few dozen posters and buttons in New Hampshire while attending political rallies and visiting campaign headquarters, said Claire Jerry, another curator at the museum.
Jerry said the museum also received older items from people who had packed them away at home and forgotten about them. The museum recently obtained a torch used in Abraham Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign that had been sitting in the attic of a small historical society in Milford, New Hampshire, Grinspan said.
"A lot of these things come from people's junk drawers," Jerry said.
Lori Ferber Collectibles in Scottsdale, Arizona, has been gathering campaign ephemera from elections, administrations, manufacturers and estate sales for over 40 years, said Steve Ferber, the company's vice president.
The company, which specializes in presidential and presidential campaign memorabilia, recently bought and sold about 160,000 Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan buttons that one manufacturer had sitting in a warehouse since the 1970s and '80s, Ferber said.

Texto completo: When Tina Sorg first saw the robot rolling through her Giant supermarket in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, she said to herself, "That thing is a little weird."
Programmed to detect spills and debris in the aisles, the robot looked like an inkjet printer with a long neck.
"It needed personality," said Sorg, 55, who manages the store's beer and wine department.
So, during one overnight shift, she went out to a nearby arts and craft store, brought back a large pair of googly eyes and, when no one was looking, affixed them on the top of the robot.
The eyes were a hit with executives at global grocery company Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Giant and Stop & Shop supermarket chains. They are now a standard feature on the company's nearly 500 robots across the United States.
How this supermarket robot got its goofy eyes touches on a serious question: Will robots with friendly faces and cute names help people feel good about devices that are taking over an increasing amount of human work?
Robots are now working everywhere from factories to living rooms. But the introduction of robots to public settings such as the grocery store is fueling new fears that humans are being pushed out of jobs. McKinsey, the consulting firm, says the grocers could immediately reduce "the pool of labor hours" by as much as 65% if they adopted all the automation technology available.
"Margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," McKinsey said in a report last year.
Retailers said their robot designs were not explicitly meant to assuage angst about job losses. Still, companies of all sizes are investing in tens of thousands of friendly looking robots that are quickly upending human work.
Most of the retail robots have just enough human qualities to make them appear benign but not too many to suggest they are replacing humans entirely.
Perhaps no other retailer is dealing as intensely with the sensitivities around automation as Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, with about 1.5 million workers. The company spent many months working with the company Bossa Nova and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to design a shelf-scanning robot with which it hopes employees and customers will feel comfortable.
This robot was designed without a face because its developers did not want customers to think they could interact with the device. But many of the robots have names, given to them by store staff. Some also wear name badges.
"We want the associates to have an attachment to it and want to protect it," said Sarjoun Skaff, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Bossa Nova. Walmart said it planned to deploy the robots in 1,000 stores by the end of the year, up from about 350.
At a Walmart in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania border, employees named the robot WALL-E - a choice partly inspired by the Pixar film that depicts a trash-collecting robot on a deserted planet.
The robot can work 365 days a year, scanning shelves with high-resolution cameras tabulating out-of-stock items. It takes a short break between shifts to recharge its batteries in a docking station.
Retailers say the robots are good for their workers. They free up employees from mundane and sometimes injury-prone jobs such as unloading delivery trucks to focus on more fulfilling tasks such as helping customers.

That Fenty gent Meet Rihanna's creative 'right hand,' Jahleel Weaver

Texto completo: At 33, Jahleel Weaver has pretty much won the celebrity-stylist lottery.
As deputy creative director of Fenty, the women's ready-to-wear and accessories line introduced by Rihanna in May, his days are spent working alongside a nine-time Grammy Award winner whose clothing brand is backed by LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, and released to her passionate fans without regard to conventional seasonal rhythms.
Theirs is a close relationship. "We talk almost every day," Weaver said. "I feel I'm her little brother," although Rihanna is younger, at 31.
"Creatively, he is my right hand," she wrote of Weaver in an email, "but at the same time, it's as if we're family."
The path that led Weaver to help guide the most talked-about fashion debut of 2019, founded by one of the most influential women in popular culture, was a long and gently winding one.
At 18, he moved from suburban Maryland to New York to study fashion design at LIM College. Weaver helped support himself by working in sales at Jeffrey, the high-end retailer in the meatpacking district known for its extensive shoe department and attentive customer service.
He quickly met some famous clients, many downtowners working in music, and began to style several. "To be working for, and building a brand," Weaver said, "I always think about my experience at Jeffrey."
Weaver was also making inroads working as a freelance stylist away from the store, and it was on one of these gigs that he met Mel Ottenberg, who is currently the creative director of Interview magazine. Ottenberg had just begun collaborating with Rihanna on her 2011 "Loud" tour and brought Weaver on to assist him.
Soon enough, Weaver and Rihanna became inseparable, traveling the globe together. (Ottenberg continues to style Rihanna on occasion, as he did in 2018, dressing her when she was a host of the Met Gala in a dazzling jewel-embroidered, papal-inspired Margiela ensemble.)
When Rihanna decided in 2014 to start the umbrella company Fenty Corp., giving it her last name, she asked Weaver to join as a junior creative director.
He was there to help her create the beauty line Fenty Beauty, which soon had legacy cosmetics brands scurrying to broaden the colors of foundation on offer; Savage x Fenty, a line of inclusive, body-positive-inspired lingerie, the show of which had fashion week attendees squealing in September; and Cameo, her everything-old-is-new-again jewelry line.
"The most valuable thing Jahleel brings to the process," Rihanna said, "is his complete understanding of my vision."
Virgil Abloh, the founder of the cult streetwear-inspired fashion line Off-White and the artistic director for menswear at Louis Vuitton (also part of LVMH), said the creative dynamic between Rihanna and Weaver has resulted in "looks that are cemented within popular culture." (Fuzzy slides were just the beginning.)
Abloh first came to know Weaver through what he refers to as an "international tribe of creatives," a community of designers and artists constantly on the move.
Weaver, although he continues to travel extensively, now lives primarily in Paris. He moved there in early 2018 to begin work on Fenty's debut, a fairly stressful undertaking.
"How do you put everything that Rihanna represents into one collection?" Weaver said.
The answer came to the pair late one night in the form of a music metaphor: an album and its release. Rather than settle on distinct, themed collections shown twice a year, Fenty would drop capsule collections throughout the year, much as singles are released over the course of an album's rollout.
This would heighten anticipation and set the brand apart from the grind of the fashion pack.
"Each release," Weaver said, "can speak to something different," with inspiration taken from various aspects of Rihanna's personal style, be it sleek futurism or the history of Cameo.
"At the end, you have a full album, a full body of work," Weaver said. "I think that's the beauty about our release schedule - there's a piece of Fenty for everything you might need to get dressed."
Basing Fenty's strategy around online drops was a radical move, jolting the old seasonal schedule with the hectic cadence of fast fashion.
But Fenty has been even more cutting edge in giving people of color a place at the top of an industry still plagued by racial inequality and insensitivity.
When Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH announced Fenty, Rihanna became the first woman and person of color to establish a house with the luxury retail giant. At a time when high-profile brands continue to be plagued by racist missteps - just this year Gucci was forced to recall a balaclava knit-top that resembled blackface - the significance of Fenty's debut was not lost on Weaver.
"All the barriers that were broken in that one day, with that one announcement," he said, "I actually cried."
Along with Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Olivier Rousteing running Balmain, Rihanna's entry into the field was further evidence to many that change, however overdue, is finally coming to the upper echelons of luxury fashion.
Weaver is feeling optimistic. "Because of people like Ri constantly breaking barriers," he said, "it makes it a lot easier to exist in space where representation for people of color didn't necessarily exist."
And his own place in that space?
"Honestly," Weaver said, "I think I'm still pinching myself."

Texto completo: When Tina Sorg first saw the robot rolling through her Giant supermarket in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, she said to herself, "That thing is a little weird."
Programmed to detect spills and debris in the aisles, the robot looked like an inkjet printer with a long neck.
"It needed personality," said Sorg, 55, who manages the store's beer and wine department.
So, during one overnight shift, she went out to a nearby arts and craft store, brought back a large pair of googly eyes and, when no one was looking, affixed them on the top of the robot.
The eyes were a hit with executives at global grocery company Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Giant and Stop & Shop supermarket chains. They are now a standard feature on the company's nearly 500 robots across the United States.
How this supermarket robot got its goofy eyes touches on a serious question: Will robots with friendly faces and cute names help people feel good about devices that are taking over an increasing amount of human work?
Robots are now working everywhere from factories to living rooms. But the introduction of robots to public settings such as the grocery store is fueling new fears that humans are being pushed out of jobs. McKinsey, the consulting firm, says the grocers could immediately reduce "the pool of labor hours" by as much as 65% if they adopted all the automation technology available.
"Margin pressure has made automation a requirement, not a choice," McKinsey said in a report last year.
Retailers said their robot designs were not explicitly meant to assuage angst about job losses. Still, companies of all sizes are investing in tens of thousands of friendly looking robots that are quickly upending human work.
Most of the retail robots have just enough human qualities to make them appear benign but not too many to suggest they are replacing humans entirely.
Perhaps no other retailer is dealing as intensely with the sensitivities around automation as Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, with about 1.5 million workers. The company spent many months working with the company Bossa Nova and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University to design a shelf-scanning robot with which it hopes employees and customers will feel comfortable.
This robot was designed without a face because its developers did not want customers to think they could interact with the device. But many of the robots have names, given to them by store staff. Some also wear name badges.
"We want the associates to have an attachment to it and want to protect it," said Sarjoun Skaff, a co-founder and the chief technology officer at Bossa Nova. Walmart said it planned to deploy the robots in 1,000 stores by the end of the year, up from about 350.
At a Walmart in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, on the Pennsylvania border, employees named the robot WALL-E - a choice partly inspired by the Pixar film that depicts a trash-collecting robot on a deserted planet.
The robot can work 365 days a year, scanning shelves with high-resolution cameras tabulating out-of-stock items. It takes a short break between shifts to recharge its batteries in a docking station.
Retailers say the robots are good for their workers. They free up employees from mundane and sometimes injury-prone jobs such as unloading delivery trucks to focus on more fulfilling tasks such as helping customers.

House panel now focusing on interference at Justice

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - House Democrats are scrutinizing whether President Donald Trump has improperly interfered at the Justice Department for political reasons, a prominent committee chairman said Friday, requesting documents and interviews with more than a dozen U.S. attorneys related to the cases of three Trump associates and a review of the FBI's Russia inquiry.
The requests are the first major return to politically charged oversight matters by the House Judiciary Committee since it helped impeach Trump late last year. But with House leaders intent on shifting attention toward domestic policy legislation they believe will help preserve their majority in this fall's election, it was not clear how far Democrats would be willing to escalate a likely fight.
Officials were careful Friday not to characterize the requests as the beginning of a new investigation, instead framing them as routine oversight. They come as Trump has moved aggressively in the wake of his impeachment acquittal to insert himself into Justice Department business.
"These circumstances are deeply troubling," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee chairman, wrote in a letter to William Barr, the attorney general. "Although you serve at the president's pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws. In turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility."
Nadler asked for materials related to a handful of criminal cases, including the sentencing of Roger Stone, antitrust matters and a review by John Durham into the roots of Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. Democrats believe Durham's inquiry is designed to undermine Mueller's findings.
In most of the cases under scrutiny, Trump has blurred the lines that traditionally separate the White House from criminal enforcement matters, offering running commentary or outright rooting for a result on Twitter and in public comments. Documentary records and interviews with prosecutors could definitively show whether the department acted based on Trump's statements or if the White House at any point issued more direct orders in private.
In the case of Stone, the president's remarks on Twitter blasting the judge and Justice Department lawyers for recommending what he said was too harsh a sentence for his longtime friend and campaign adviser went so far that Barr delivered an extraordinary public rebuke, but only after senior department officials intervened to reverse the recommendation of career prosecutors and suggest a shorter sentence.
The attorney general said earlier this month that he would not be "bullied" into any result and warned that the president's tweets made it "impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."
Although tensions have eased somewhat in recent weeks, Barr remains in a precarious position. Trump has largely defied his request, continuing to tweet about the Stone case and forcing Barr to contemplate what it would take for him to resign. The Judiciary Committee's scrutiny could only make things more difficult for the attorney general, whose actions have drawn intense criticism inside and outside the Justice Department for politicizing the law enforcement system.
Nadler cited those tensions as he asked for the materials by mid-March so the committee could study the matter before a planned hearing with Barr on March 31.
If history is any guide, though, the exchange will not be an easy one. The department generally opposes handing over files related to ongoing matters, especially to lawmakers of another party, though it has made exceptions. And Nadler and Barr have particularly bad blood, stemming from the attorney general's handling of the special counsel's investigation.

Fear Itself Is the Biggest Coronavirus Danger

Texto completo: A fascinating story in the New York Times almost 20 years ago featured the headline "Nuns Offer Clues to Alzheimer's and Aging." Key evidence consisted of essays written by the nuns when they were young, which suggested that "'idea density,' many thoughts woven into a small number of words, [was] a trait correlating closely with nuns who later escaped Alzheimer's."
That study has come back to me often. Columnists nowadays who fasten their well-worn anti-Trump talking points to every news event in our ever-interesting world are not bringing value to their readers. They banalize our world, empty it of interest and meaning. If the nun story is correct, they should worry about Alzheimer's.
The world may be embarked on an experiment. A global economy in which millions are employed and sustained by trade and travel is threatened with lockdown. The U.S. is headed toward a presidential election in which the usual crowding together for debates, meetings and conventions may be discouraged.
Donald Trump's successful 2016 campaign consisted largely of raucous rallies. Bernie Sanders is becoming no slouch at the same. If that's off the table now, does it mean Mike Bloomberg's ad-heavy approach gets a second life? Even more so if management skills are suddenly in demand among voters amid coronavirus-spawned chaos?
And what if none of this disorder is even warranted?
"Once widely criticized, the Wuhan quarantine bought the world time to prepare for Covid-19" says a headline in the medical publication Statnews. Read further, though, for the piling up of doubts about whether the costs were worth the benefit of slowing the spread of a disease that may be no worse than the flu.
In the U.S., influenza infects upward of 29 million a year, yet less than half of us bother to get a flu vaccine. We don't wash our hands or take other precautions religiously, though we may do so now under bombardment of coronavirus warnings.
When President Trump said at his press conference Wednesday that the disease might or might not become a big deal, he was faithfully encompassing the scientific possibilities. The press shrieked that he was misleading the public, never mind that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was saying exactly the same thing. "We can really keep this thing contained," he said at his own press briefing on Wednesday, and if a serious outbreak should occur, "we've got a long time to ramp up if we ever had anything like that."
Ditto the governor of California, also a Democrat, whose state may have identified the first truly domestic case. He said one day after the president spoke: "This is not our first great challenge as it relates to public health. . . . These protocols have been perfected."
Note the following carefully: To optimize the outcome of this difficult situation -- neither overkill nor underkill -- the crux will be giving the American people an accurate picture of the risks so they can accurately judge the costs they should be willing to bear to reduce those risks.
Just how deadly is Covid-19 compared with the flu, which kills about 0.16% of its victims (including 125 children so far this season)? On Tuesday, the World Health Organization's Bruce Aylward, having returned from a painstakingly negotiated visit to Wuhan, seemed to argue for accepting the Chinese figure of roughly 2%. But remember Stalin's quip about the pope's army: The WHO is dependent on China's goodwill, has little power to coerce China, and understands how readily Beijing might cut off cooperation in a fit of neo-Maoism.
Mr. Aylward's view is strongly disputed by many other experts. In the chaos of Wuhan, they suspect China missed thousands of mild cases while also letting dozens die who would have lived with proper advice and care. Numerous have been the press reports of elderly victims expiring at home after being turned away from hospitals.
Here's my guess (and it's just a guess): Once authorities in the U.S. start looking seriously for domestic Covid-19, they are bound to find it. The pillorying of California for not detecting its case sooner is really just evidence of how slow the media has been to grasp the Covid-19 challenge. Which of the million-plus people who come down with flu symptoms each week should be given the expensive, hard-to-obtain test? Which of the thousands who check into hospitals with generic breathing difficulties?
At the same time, America is entering the final month of peak flu season. This year's has already been only about two-thirds as deadly as the 2017-18 season, in which 79,400 died. Americans may actually end up having a safer flu season overall. Heightened precautions taken against Covid-19 will also inhibit the spread of more familiar flu and coronavirus strains.
And once America has Covid-19 in perspective, scientists can turn their attention back to those urgent Alzheimer's studies.

Texto completo: Monitor columnist
One day, Becky Bonner might be the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question.
Name the first female general manager in NBA history. Wait. Let's revise that. The first female GM for any big-league North American sports team, be it basketball, baseball, hockey or football.
Ever.
If she's hired one day – and there's a strong possibility that she will – the answer will be the kid who played at Concord High School. Now she's the director of player development and basketball operations for the NBA's Orlando Magic, whose front office has said they have plans – big plans, historic plans – for Bonner in their future.
Her duties now include everything, short of lugging around that portable steamer thing at home games and yelling “hot dogs, here!” And, as many of you know, when it comes to the Bonner family, Becky would have had sold more hot dogs than anyone else.
For now, even without the GM title, she's highly respected, sitting in on meetings, discussing draft picks and evaluating players.
“I'm grateful for the opportunity I've had, no matter what happens next,” Bonner said by phone from Orlando. “I was an athlete. I was very competitive, so any vertical move at this point is a goal that makes sense.”
Vertical means the GM spot.
Reports came out three years ago that Bonner would get a chance. Jeff Weltman, the Magic's President of Basketball Operations, was quoted as saying Bonner had “unlimited potential.”
Another report said that Bonner's official title was director of player development and quality control, but it was no secret that the Magic saw her moving up.
Bonner, meanwhile, knows what she wants and is reaching for it. It's a Bonner family thing, a confidence-minus-the-arrogance thing.
“Becky does not want to be presumptuous,” said her mother, Paula Bonner, a longtime Concord educator. “She feels like she wants to learn all operations and management work, and she thinks that may work toward (the GM role) happening.”
Paula, who's 6-foot-2, is the matriarch in a family of tall, talented people. Her husband, retired postal worker Dave Bonner, is 6-foot-9. Her brother Matt Bonner is 6-10 and won two NBA championships with the San Antonio Spurs during his 12-year career. He does TV work for the Spurs and runs clinics here, in his hometown.
Her other brother, Luke Bonner, is 7-feet and played big-time college ball and later emerged as a pioneer as college players sought payment for the use of their image in video games.
The boys prepared Becky well. She played on boys' teams through middle school. She showed her creativity while playing Matt one-on-one on the family driveway, grabbing a Whiffle-Ball Bat to aid in her defense, swinging, reaching, adapting.
At 6-foot-2, she dominated the opposition at Concord High, got a scholarship to Stanford University and later starred at Boston University.
She played a year of pro ball in Sweden, and served as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland and the University of Louisville.
She worked in the NBA's New York City headquarters and traveled with the men's Olympic Team and its legendary coach, Mike Krzyzewski, helping where she could while promoting the sport, the NBA and its stars, and playing defense against such players as Kevin Durant in practice.
She worked for NBA-sponsored Basketball Without Borders, ran clinics and promoted the sport around the world. In Brazil, South Africa, China, Finland, Spain.
The Magic hired her in 2017. “For me,” Bonner said, “it's been a natural and easy transition.”
Paula mentioned Becky's strong desire to be part of something bigger than herself. “She enjoyed men's basketball with the Olympics and working with Coach K,” Paula said, referring to the Duke coach, who has more wins than anyone in college basketball history. “She's very excited about the camaraderie and the feeling of being a part of a team again.”
Howard Beck, formerly the NBA writer for the New York Times, did a big spread on Bonner shortly after she arrived in Orlando. Even then, this thing was bubbling.
“Unofficially,” Beck wrote for Bleacher Report, “she's training to become a general manager.”
One report said Orlando had struck gold, shortly after Bonner joined the team. Secret gold. She quickly implanted herself into the Magic culture and did a little hocus pocus herself, which was part of a revamping process the team had envisioned.
There was a plan in place. Make the organization more professional with improvements at the arena. Make it more family-friendly, add some class.
“Our family room, we call it our living room,” Bonner said. “There's an easy way to enter and get food and leave your kids with a babysitter. Having this inclusive family makes everyone's life better and busy over the course of 82 games.”
She's carved out some of her own contributions, and her list of duties could stretch across a basketball court. She helped coordinate renovations at the arena and hired a chef and a nutritionist. She arranges player appearances for kids, organizes team meals, runs errands.
As Bonner said, “It evolved into a service-based role. My job is to make everyone's life around me easier and to help the players with what they need off the court so they can focus on maximizing their potential.”
If we stopped here, we'd still have a nice local column. The one about the Concord kid who buys sandwiches for NBA Players. Welcomes the players' children to a new-and-improved facility. Things like that.
Elsewhere, Bonner goes to all 82 games, sitting where ever she wants at home games – team box, family lounge, trainer's room to check on an injured player, a ticketed seat with her boyfriend.
She's no hostess, though. She's trying to dispel stereotypes, expand roles for women, move them upstairs, where the decisions are made. She's on the ground floor of a movement to include women in administrative jobs, in the NBA and other leagues.
“I'm aware that I'm part of a minority group,” Bonner said. “I'm proud that I have helped bring female candidates in for interviews and I'm part of the process of bringing women along. I grew up on the women's side, but I was also exposed to the NBA life as well.”
She works with young players, “teaching them healthy habits, financing and family dynamics, time management,” Bonner said.
She scouts college players, in person and on TV, rates their ability, passes on what she's learned to the staff. She's striking a balance between being excited and grounded, mentioning Matt's former coach with the Spurs, Gregg Popovich, known as Pops, one of the best ever.
“Get over yourself,” were Pop's words of wisdom, Bonner said.
She's learning to do that. Keep perspective. She got a truckload of it last year, watching her father fight multiple myeloma and undergo bypass surgery. Dave told me he's feeling better these days.
He and Paula spent their lives watching their three kids shine in basketball. Now, they excel in life.
Team officials were unavailable to comment on Bonner because it's All-Star Weekend, a break in the schedule. She lives in Orlando with her boyfriend. She's enjoying the time off.
“The job is more of a lifestyle,” Bonner said. “When you sign up for this, it's making sure it works, being available to anyone for anything that might happen.”
Including making history.
Certainly no trivial pursuit.

Texto completo: The next Democratic debate is scheduled for March 15, affording the relevant authorities plenty of time to tweak the format - and by "tweak," I mean, of course, obliterate with explosives.
Who on God's Earth thinks what CBS mashed into a prime-time broadcast Tuesday is the way a modern presidential debate ought to be presented?
I suppose it's possible there was some midlevel corporate operative deep within the network's programming division who wobbled away from the 10th debate of this election cycle thinking, "Yeah, that was fine," but the rest of us are still trying to decide who should be most embarrassed: the candidates, the moderators, the live audience or the people watching at home hoping for some trace of clarity. Aren't they adorable?
Let's start on stage and work our way back.
The candidates, now reduced to seven from the original 189, clearly prefer one of two basic optics. It's either one person speaking while the rest try to flag down their Uber, or it's everyone talking at once. If I want a TV show where everyone talks at the same time, I'll watch "The View."
The primary strategy on stage is to attack the candidate who projects as the most likely to achieve actual momentum in the moment. It was Joe Biden in the early going, then Mike Bloomberg, then Bernie Sanders on Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren, who eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg in Nevada last week, did it again Tuesday just for the hell of it. One or more of these people should have the option, for at least one debate, to wear one of those gray noncontact jerseys the injured Penguins put on at practice. Bernie could have pulled one on Tuesday and saved himself plenty of grief.
The whole attack strategy is not only misguided, but it sucks the rhetorical life from the whole purpose of the debate, to inform that portion of the public that cares enough to tune in. Attacks should be aimed at the incumbent. This is a one-issue election - one - and it's President Donald Trump. Moreover, there is one qualification - one - and it's electability. No one is tuning in to see what Pete Buttigieg thinks of Amy Klobuchar.
For a few minutes Tuesday, it appeared Mr. Biden had figured this out. Near the middle of the stage, he kept a regal posture in quiet bemusement while the others savaged each other. Joe looked almost presidential, but he eventually found a groove from which he complained about the monitors over and over (not that they didn't have it coming).
When CBS monitor Gayle King warned candidates to stick to their allotted time, Mr. Biden chirped, "Good idea!"
When Ms. King replied, "We'll get to you," Mr. Biden said, "You keep saying that, but you haven't done it yet." When the former vice president did talk, he mostly complained about being restricted: "Why am I stopping? No one else stops. Gentlemen don't get very well treated up here."
So Joe made himself into a victim, which was totally useless and seemingly ignorant of the fact that victimization is Mr. Trump's lane exclusively ("Very unfair!").
As for the moderators, Ms. King and Norah O'Donnell were definitively steamrolled by just about everyone on stage, thus affixing to what is supposed to be a very serious event the general flavor of a bar fight you're listening to from the backroom.
Separately and together, Ms. King and Ms. O'Donnell failed spectacularly. The questions they plucked from Twitter were better than those they asked themselves, which were transparently calibrated to ignite fireworks rather than add to anyone's understanding of the issues. Forty-two minutes in, they were reinforced for a time by Major Garrett, Bill Whitaker and Margaret Brennan, but the horses had fled the barn.
In the end, rather than provide time to each candidate for a summation or a closing statement, CBS decided to ask each about their "motto" and to reveal a "misconception about you."
What, it's "The Dating Game" now?
No one watching for the first time could sit through two hours and 15 minutes of this and come away thinking America is a serious country. When we produce the presidential debates like a very special Tuesday night edition of World Wrestling Entertainment's "Monday Night Raw," with pulsating music at the top and a live audience that acted like it had walked in from a tailgate, we aren't really serious.
When Ms. Klobuchar mentioned the so-called Charleston loophole - a hole in the applicable gun law that enabled Dylann Roof to get the weapon he used to murder nine people at a Charleston, S.C., church - some yahoo shouted out like his hometown had been name-checked by Jimmy Fallon on "The Tonight Show."
"The Big Bang Theory" may be filmed before a live studio audience, but that doesn't mean the presidential debates have to be. It's stupid. If there must be an audience, it has to instructed to sit down and shut up. This would be easier if the networks, particularly the cable channels, weren't so intent on pimping these things like an endless Super Bowl pregame show.
Finally, consider the home audience and the conclusions the networks and the candidates have apparently drawn about us based on this show. How dumb do they think we are? Exactly as dumb as all this appears.
Obviously, I expect all this to be rectified in the next two weeks.
You're welcome.

Texto completo: John Mulaney hosts "S.N.L.", while the child rapper Young Dylan debuts his new show on Nickelodeon.
What's on TV
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. John Mulaney had to postpone a show in Toronto because he was "drafted" to host this episode, Lorne Michaels wrote in an apology to Mulaney's Canadian fans. (Mulaney weighed in: "I'm afraid of Lorne, so I do what he says.") This is the comedian's third time hosting the show. He's joined by the musical guest David Byrne, the former frontman of Talking Heads, who just wrapped up the first run of his critically acclaimed Broadway show "American Utopia." (For those who missed the stage run, don't fret -- Byrne will reprise the production in the fall, and Spike Lee has announced that he will direct a film version to be released later this year.)
TYLER PERRY'S YOUNG DYLAN 8:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Since retiring his Madea character last year, the prolific writer and director Tyler Perry has been preoccupied with several projects. The latest is this new children's show, starring the charismatic child rapper Dylan Gilmer, who goes by Young Dylan. The aspiring hip-hop star plays himself -- a cool, street-smart kid whose grandmother sends him to live with his cousins' family, upending their conservative way of life.
SEVEN WORLDS, ONE PLANET 9 p.m. on BBC America. The first season finale of this globe-trotting nature show takes us to Africa for a close look at its wildlife, with scenes highlighting hippos in need of water and ferocious battles between giraffes.
What's Streaming
COLOR OUT OF SPACE (2020) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or Vudu. More than 20 years after the director Richard Stanley was fired from the set of "The Island of Dr. Moreau," he returns to narrative filmmaking with this trippy science fiction horror. The movie, an adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's short story, follows a family that has recently traded the city life for a quiet New England Farm. When the father, Nathan (Nicolas Cage), finally manages to reignite the spark missing from his marriage, a meteorite crashes into his front yard. Its crater unleashes a mysterious energy -- in the form of a hypnotic, purple hue -- that goes after the family in bizarre, bloody ways. Jeannette Catsoulis named the film a Critic's Pick in her review for The New York Times, writing that "lovers of aberrant, gooey B-movies will be all in."
PAAVO JARVI AND SOL GABETTA 2 p.m. on medici.tv. The Estonian conductor Paavo Jarvi leads Japan's NHK Symphony Orchestra and the Argentine cellist Sol Gabetta in this live performance from Germany. The program starts with the Emily Dickinson-inspired piece "How Slow the Wind," by the Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, followed by a Schumann Cello Concerto and Bruckner's Seventh Symphony.
IN SECRET (2014) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Elizabeth Olsen seeks passion in a loveless marriage in this romantic thriller, set in 19th-century Paris. She finds it in her husband's friend, and it's all downhill from there. The movie leaves Hulu Saturday.

Texto completo: His film "J'accuse" had the most nominations at the César Awards in Paris, drawing outrage because of his history of accusations of sexual assault.
LONDON -- Roman Polanski, the film director who fled the United States in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for having sex with a 13-year-old, was a big winner Friday night at the Césars, France's equivalent of the Academy Awards, despite outrage over his nominations.
He was named best director for "J'accuse" (The English title: "An Officer and a Spy") about Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish military officer wrongly convicted of treason in what remains France's most notorious miscarriage of justice.
The film won two other awards, having led the nominations with 12, the most of any movie. Mr. Polanski was given the award for best adapted screenplay along with Robert Harris, the British novelist. The movie also won for best costume design. It was nominated for the best film award, but that honor went to "Les Misérables," a crime drama that shows the harsh reality of life in Paris's immigrant-heavy suburbs.
"Very few" people applauded Mr. Polanski's best director award, said Le Monde, the French newspaper, and some stars walked out.
Mr. Polanski was not there to collect any of the prizes. He announced on Thursday that he would not attend the ceremony because he feared a "public lynching" from protesters outside, angered at his links to child sexual abuse.
"We know how this evening will unfold already," Mr. Polanksi said in a statement. "What place can there be in such deplorable conditions for a film about the defense of truth, the fight for justice, blind hate and anti-Semitism?"
Mr. Polanski pulled out of the 2017 awards for the same reason.
On Friday, the French police fired tear gas outside the Paris concert hall hosting the César Film Awards in a clash with people protesting the director, according to local news reports. Protesters also pulled down a safety barrier outside the venue, but the police pushed them back, so they did not make it onto the red carpet.
Other demonstrators waved placards reading, "Shame on an industry that protects rapists."
The United States considers Mr. Polanski a fugitive of justice but has been unable to secure his extradition. He has also faced other accusations of sexual assault. In November, Valentine Monnier, a photographer, accused Mr. Polanski of raping her in 1975, when she was 18, in a ski chalet in Switzerland. He has denied the accusations.
Reviewers praised "J'accuse" at the Venice Film Festival last year. "The longer you look at it, the more impressive it grows," Xan Brooks wrote in The Guardian. It won similar acclaim in France after its release in November, and the film topped the country's box office. But it was also met with protests, and some in France's film industry distanced themselves from Mr. Polanski.
After the César nominations were announced in January, a host of French feminist organizations said they would protest the ceremony. "If rape is an art, give Polanski all the Césars," they said in an open letter published in a leading newspaper.
Adèle Haenel, one of France's most prominent young actresses who said she had suffered from sexual abuse in the country's film industry, also complained this month about his nominations.
"Distinguishing Polanski is spitting in the face of all victims," she told The New York Times. "It means raping women isn't that bad."
Ms. Haenel walked out of the room at the César ceremony after Mr. Polanski won best director, waved an arm in disgust and appeared to say, "It's a shame."
Several others followed, including Céline Sciamma, the director of "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," which starred Ms. Haenel.
Mr. Polanski's decision to withdraw from this year's award ceremony didn't ease the controversy. On Friday morning, Franck Riester, France's culture minister, said in a television interview that if Mr. Polanski won best director at the Césars, it would be "a bad symbol given we must all be aware of the need to fight against sexual violence and sexism."
But Mr. Riester said he would be happy for "J'accuse" to win best film. There was "no need to penalize the team" for Mr. Polanski's behavior, he said.
The film's first award of the night was for best costume designer. But the winner, Pascaline Chavanne, was not present to collect her trophy. The entire cast and production team had shunned the event over criticism aimed at their director.

4 Cellphone Carriers Are Facing Penalties Exceeding $200 Million

Texto completo: The Federal Communications Commission has approved a proposal to fine T-Mobile, AT&T and two other cellphone carriers more than $ 200 million for selling customers' location data to companies that allowed it to be misused by rogue law enforcement officers and others.
The proposed fines, announced on Friday, are among the largest the F.C.C. has sought in years, representing a major action by an agency whose chairman has pushed for a lighter touch to industry regulation under President Trump.
It has taken the commission nearly two years since the first complaint about the practice to get to this point. The agency is making the move after repeated public reports about data abuse -- and after several companies continued to sell access to troves of personal information for months despite saying they were sharply limiting the practice.
In notices sent to the carriers, the F.C.C. said it would seek more than $ 91 million from T-Mobile, $ 57 million from AT&T, $ 48 million from Verizon and $ 12 million from Sprint. The agency found the carriers had violated a section of the Telecommunications Act requiring them to protect the confidentiality of customers' call information. The penalties reflect the length of time the carriers failed to safeguard the data and the number of companies with which they shared it. T-Mobile's fine is highest in part because it shared with over 80 entities, according to the documents. Sprint, by contrast, shared with fewer than a dozen.
Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, said the move demonstrated that the agency was serious about privacy. "We took decisive action to protect American consumers, and we are confident in the balance that we struck," he said at a news conference on Friday.
Three of the five commissioners at the agency, all Republicans, approved the measure. One Democratic commissioner dissented, and another approved partially. Both Democrats objected to the amount of time that passed before the F.C.C. acted, among other things.
"We took nearly two years to even propose a fine," Jessica Rosenworcel, the dissenting Democratic commissioner, said in an interview. "That's not acting with urgency, and that's not understanding the scope of the risk to the public."
The F.C.C.'s proposal is not the final word on how much the companies will pay. A T-Mobile spokeswoman said the company intended "to dispute the conclusions" of the F.C.C. investigation, including the fine. The other companies, which will also have the chance to contest the findings, did not respond to requests for comment.
The carriers already have argued against the finding that they broke the law, contending that the rules apply only when a phone is making a call, not when it's communicating with a network for purposes like sending data, according to the documents. Michael O'Rielly, a Republican commissioner, said in a statement that he found the argument persuasive and was approving the measure with "serious reservations."
The sale of location data has become a hot business as smartphones have proliferated and technology for gleaning their whereabouts has become more precise. The information is valuable to marketers, police departments and even investment firms because it can provide revealing details about people's daily lives, such as where they live, what shops they frequent and what doctors they visit.
The trade in location data is largely unregulated. The F.C.C.'s action is possible only because the telecommunications industry is subject to more stringent regulations than technology companies are. Firms ranging from small app makers to tech giants like Google collect massive amounts of the data from GPS, Wi-Fi and other signals, without specific laws addressing what they can do with it.
Cellphone carriers aimed to get a chunk of the business through deals with so-called location aggregators, middleman companies that provided the information to other businesses. Cellular network data is often less precise than information from apps, but it covers the vast majority of the population and is almost always available.
To protect privacy, the carriers relied on a system of contracts that required location companies to seek customers' consent -- by responding to a text message, for example, or pressing a button on an app. But the carriers failed to catch multiple companies and people following customers without their permission.
The F.C.C. said it began its investigation immediately after an article in The New York Times showed how the system had led to privacy breaches. The Times in 2018 reported that the data was eventually making its way to law enforcement, including to a former sheriff who used it to track people without a warrant. He gained access by uploading documents he falsely claimed were legal orders -- including his car and health insurance policies and work training manuals, according to local news reports of his prosecution.
Securus Technologies, the company that offered the data to law enforcement, is better known for providing telephone services to inmates. Mr. Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, represented Securus while working at a law firm in 2011; he also worked as a lawyer for Verizon.
After the Securus episode, the companies said they would sharply limit the practice. But in early 2019, the technology website Motherboard showed that carriers were still selling data, and that it was ending up in the hands of bounty hunters.
Later that year, the companies said in response to questions from an F.C.C. commissioner that they had stopped selling the information.
The F.C.C. said that the initial Times report "exposed serious inadequacies with the safeguards" the companies were using to protect their data. Because the carriers did not address the problem in a timely manner, the agency said, they "failed to take reasonable measures" as required under the law.
Privacy hawks at the agency and on Capitol Hill have objected to the fines, saying they were too late and too small. Despite being an unusually large penalty by F.C.C. standards, the proposed judgment is modest compared with the companies' revenue, which totaled more than $ 350 billion last year.
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who first raised concerns about the data sharing, said in a statement that the amount was "comically inadequate" to deter future violations.
He added that other technology companies had been willing to accept fines as part of the cost of doing business. "The only way to truly protect Americans' personal information is to pass strong privacy legislation," he said.

Texto completo: With the hire of Stacy-Marie Ishmael, a digitally savvy journalist, the Austin news organization signals the importance of online expertise.
The Texas Tribune, a digital news platform founded in 2009, has hired Stacy-Marie Ishmael, a digitally savvy journalist, as its new editorial director, The Tribune's chief executive said on Friday.
Ms. Ishmael, 35, a veteran of The Financial Times, BuzzFeed News and Apple, will effectively replace Emily Ramshaw, The Tribune's editor in chief from 2016 until her departure in January.
Ms. Ramshaw and The Tribune's chief audience officer, Amanda Zamora, left the organization to start The 19th, a nonprofit news site focused on women and politics that is scheduled for a summer rollout.
Ms. Ishmael, who worked most recently as a senior editor at Apple's app store, said that issues affecting Texas often turn out to be important to the nation as a whole. "Understanding them through the lens of Texas is a good way to understand the overall U.S. political story, or U.S. demographic story, or U.S. justice story," she said.
Joining Ms. Ishmael at The Tribune's headquarters in Austin will be Millie Tran, 30, the deputy off-platform editor at The New York Times. Ms. Tran, whose title will be chief product officer, said she was looking forward to "figuring out this problem of finding a sustainable position for local news."
Ms. Ishmael and Ms. Tran, neither of whom has lived before in the Lone Star State, will report to Evan Smith, The Tribune's chief executive and a co-founder, who helped start the organization in 2009 after nearly two decades at Texas Monthly.
He said the two hires represented an acknowledgment that The Tribune's priorities included not only the traditional goals of covering one of the country's largest and most fascinating states (just ask Texans), but an assurance that its journalism reached a larger and more diverse group of readers.
"They're thinking about this stuff at a much higher level," Mr. Smith, 53, said in a phone interview.
When Mr. Smith replaced himself as The Tribune's editor in chief four years ago, he elevated Ms. Ramshaw, who had been at The Tribune since 2010 after working as a reporter for The Dallas Morning News. It made sense for a seasoned Texas journalist to run a news operation that boasts having the largest statehouse bureau of any outlet in the country.
Starting in the fall, when he learned that Ms. Ramshaw and Ms. Zamora would be leaving, Mr. Smith looked beyond Texas for their replacements. He said a conversation with Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, who is joining The Times as a media columnist on Sunday, had led him to Ms. Ishmael and Ms. Tran.
In their time at BuzzFeed, Ms. Ishmael and Ms. Tran seized on the realization that readers who arrived at the site via social media tended to do so on their phones -- a truism today, but underappreciated at the time -- and set about building mobile-specific apps.
Evan Smith said that although the pair would be new to living in Texas, they knew how to connect with digital readers, a priority for The Tribune in 2020. Ms. Ishmael, he said, is "an enormously passionate advocate for diversity and inclusiveness." Ms. Tran, he added, "is obsessed with how people get and share news."
The Tribune's newsroom has grown even as local publications nationwide struggle to survive because of declining ad revenue and other factors. The site expects to have more than 100 employees later this year, including more than 50 journalists.
The Tribune's 2020 budget calls for almost $ 11 million in revenue. That amount comes from donations -- John Thornton, a venture capitalist and a co-founder of The Tribune, has given more than $ 2 million through the years -- nonprofit grants and readers who chip in small amounts to support the free site. It also receives corporate sponsorships for events, including the annual Tribune Festival.
"What I've come around to is, we're the Boy Who Lived," said Evan Smith, using a Harry Potter reference to describe The Tribune's survival. "The road behind us is littered with the bones of well-intentioned people who tried to make this work and couldn't."

Steyer's 'Unlimited Money' Changes Contours of Race

Texto completo: The campaign of Tom Steyer, the hedge fund mogul, has elevated his spending to a new level in South Carolina. But the return on his investment is unclear.
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Tom Steyer's prolific spending in South Carolina has earned him a distinction shared most prominently by Google: His name has been turned into a verb.
"We're literally calling it 'Steyered' here," Colleen Condon, the chair of the Charleston County Democratic Party, said Thursday. "It means you can buy anything you want. You can afford the most ads and afford the most staffers."
The term has become part of South Carolina's contemporary political lexicon as the state's Democrats debate the impact Mr. Steyer, a California billionaire, has had on the run-up to this year's primary, which takes place on Saturday. His campaign has showered money across the state, especially among the African-American community, hiring black-owned vendors and minority staff members. But his lavish spending has led to accusations of vote-buying and soul-searching among Democrats worried that apparent conflicts of interest and unseemly financial arrangements are tarnishing the state party's image.
There have also been allegations, both public and private, that the Steyer campaign crossed ethical lines in its use of money by placing state lawmakers who endorsed him, or their family members, on his payroll.
Former State Representative Fletcher N. Smith Jr., for example, said that he was offended when a staff member for Mr. Steyer came to his law office in Greenville several months ago and suggested that he become a consultant for the campaign, an overture he interpreted as an attempt to purchase his support. "I can't be bought," said Mr. Smith, who also formerly served on the Greenville County Council.
And some worry that a billionaire spending so much of his money delivers a distorted message to those who might seek office.
"It seems to be reinforcing the idea that only those who are wealthy should run for office," said Brady Quirk-Garvan, the former Charleston County party chair. "I'm trying to find people to run for County Council seats and State House seats and people will say, 'You know I don't have money like Steyer does."'
Lawmakers who have joined Mr. Steyer's payroll deny there is anything inappropriate about the arrangement, saying their expertise is valuable. And in a statement issued by his campaign, Mr. Steyer said he was insulted by implications that lawmakers were for sale. As for the campaign's decision to hire lawmakers as advisers, Jimmy Williams, a senior adviser to the campaign, said: "I can't think of anybody better to hire than a sitting member of the House or Senate to advise us on what their constituents think."
With polls showing Mr. Steyer in third in the state with 15 to 18 percent of the vote, he may win his first delegates of the race, but beyond that it is not clear exactly what he has accomplished other than increasing his name recognition. Still, he has definitely left South Carolinians a little more prosperous, even as some of his spending has prompted questions of impropriety.
While running for office, Mr. Steyer also has donated generously to sponsor Democratic Party activities, like get-out-the-vote drives.
Mr. Steyer quit his hedge fund nearly a decade ago and pledged to give away much of his money, becoming known as a climate change activist and a leader in the movement to impeach President Trump. He entered the presidential race in July in what was viewed as a surprising move. By October, he had become a formidable political and financial force in South Carolina, recalls Ms. Condon.
Everything Mr. Steyer's campaign has done here seems super sized. He has saturated the market with an estimated $ 18 million in television spending alone, dwarfing every other candidate, and his mostly homegrown ground staff of more than 100 workers helps arrange catered meals unfailingly at his campaign events.
Ms. Condon said that when the Charleston County Democrats decided to hold a political event called Blue Jamboree last October and asked the presidential candidates to be paid sponsors, Mr. Steyer's campaign was enthusiastic.
"Steyer not only sponsored, he asked what else he could sponsor," Ms. Condon said. "Could he sponsor lunch for the press? He also hired the Benedict College marching band to come perform. We told him that, 'You realize if you're bringing people in, you have to buy tickets for them.' So he gave us over $ 4,500 to bring in Benedict College."
The band from the historically black college in Columbia -- which Ms. Condon said was also compensated by Mr. Steyer's campaign -- came by bus (also supplied by Mr. Steyer) to Charleston and played at the event.
"Honestly, I'm not against Steyer's message, but it's an enviable position," said Ms. Condon, who recently endorsed Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind. "Certainly Steyer's campaign has what most candidates wish for -- unlimited money."
Mr. Quirk-Garvan has raised questions about whether Mr. Steyer has used financial inducements to grow the list of state officials endorsing him.
James H. Hodges, a former governor who is now president of McGuireWoods Consulting, said the practice is not new.
"He's not the first candidate nor will he be the last that puts people on the payroll," Mr. Hodges said. "It's an art form in Iowa and New Hampshire, so he's not unique in that regard. But I think what's drawn attention is just the amount."
One addition to Mr. Steyer's list of endorsers this week was Representative Michael Rivers of Beaufort County, who had previously supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but decided to switch his allegiance five days before the primary.
Mr. Rivers, an ordained minister, introduced Mr. Steyer at an event in Hilton Head, where a mostly white group of about 200 retirees were treated to breakfast. "One thing we know, he's not cheap," Mr. Rivers quipped in making the introduction, prompting a tweeted response from Mr. Quirk-Garvan, who raised questions about Mr. Rivers' sudden change of heart.
Mr. Rivers did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Mr. Rivers was the latest addition to Mr. Steyer's camp, making him one of 13 current and former state legislators who have endorsed Mr. Steyer. Several of them have been named paid campaign advisers, including Representative Jerry N. Govan of Orangeburg County, the head of the state legislature's Black Caucus.
Among the list of endorsers is Representative Leola Robinson-Simpson of Greenville, whose son and niece are on Mr. Steyer's campaign payroll.
In a letter published in the Greenville News this week, Ms. Robinson-Simpson praised Mr. Steyer's education platform.
"If anyone thinks Miss Leola can be bought, they're wrong," Mr. Williams said. "This is a woman who sat in jail for being black."
Ms. Robinson-Simpson also did not respond to messages seeking comment.
When both Mr. Quirk-Garvan and State Senator Richard A. Harpootlian, who are both white, publicly criticized the practice of hiring lawmakers who endorse campaigns, their comments were criticized as racist, a charge repeated Friday by Mr. Williams of the Steyer campaign.
This week, two black current and former politicians in the state -- Mr. Smith and Brandon P. Brown, who ran for Congress in 2018 -- said in interviews with The New York Times that they also had misgivings about the practice.
"African-Americans are not for sale," said Mr. Brown, of Greenville, who worked on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s 2008 presidential campaign. "This is not plantation politics. It's almost shameful if you go into a state and say, 'I've got a check for you if you will support me.' That's exactly what politics has become in a billionaire's club."
Mr. Brown initially supported Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, but now he supports Mr. Biden, as does Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith said of Mr. Steyer: "I'm not interested in your money. I'm interested in good government."
The statement from the Steyer campaign alluded to recent remarks by Representative James E. Clyburn, the most influential black Democrat in the state, who said he found allegations of vote-buying offensive.
"Representative Clyburn was right," Mr. Steyer said, "when he said that it's important to contract with black organizations to build a grass-roots campaign, get out the vote, and connect with communities across this great state -- and that it's right that they get paid for their expertise and hard work."
The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Steyer's campaign rents its South Carolina state headquarters from a company owned by Mr. Clyburn's daughter, Jennifer Clyburn Reed. Mr. Clyburn's office said he had no involvement in that arrangement.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clyburn endorsed Mr. Biden.
Another issue that has drawn scrutiny is the pursuit of grants from the philanthropies operated by Mr. Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor.
A prominent minister ignited a social media outcry two weeks ago when he said his church was applying for a grant from one of the Steyer foundations -- the same day Ms. Taylor was set to hold a campaign event at the church.
Kate Franch, chair of the Greenville County Democratic Party, said Steyer campaign staff members had approached her inquiring about community organizations that might be worthy of grants.
"My understanding is that there's a process to apply for money," Ms. Franch said. "The campaign knew about it. The staffers were to be on the lookout for community organizations."
Mr. Williams, the campaign adviser, said: "I don't think any campaign worker should bring up anything about the foundations." He said that Mr. Steyer and Ms. Taylor had removed themselves from foundation activities during the campaign.
Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, a professor of law at Notre Dame, said that donations to charity by political candidates could be legally problematic, but only if something is expected in return.
"If he donates money as a quid pro quo -- that's a problem," Mr. Mayer said. "That would be bribery."
"But if it's basically, look, I went to South Carolina, I saw all these great charities, I reached into my pocket and gave them something, that's not a problem," said Mr. Mayer, an expert in election and nonprofit law.
As Ms. Condon pointed out, all of Mr. Steyer's spending may not help his standing in Saturday's primary, known here as "First in the South."
After that, it's on to Super Tuesday when he faces an even bigger money machine, the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg, who is not on the South Carolina ballot.
"He's Steyering it, but he's going to be out-Steyered by Bloomberg," Ms. Condon predicted.

In a New Pitch to Voters, Bloomberg Highlights His Experience Managing a Crisis

Texto completo: Michael R. Bloomberg is trying to highlight the part of his record that conveys the competence and cool-headedness he says are missing in the White House.
CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. -- Hobbled by lackluster debate performances and with time running short, Michael R. Bloomberg is trying to refocus his presidential campaign on his experience dealing with disasters as the mayor of New York, hoping to draw a stark contrast with President Trump's handling of the coronavirus and the managerial records of some of his Democratic opponents.
With a sharpened speech on the campaign trail and a slick new television commercial, Mr. Bloomberg is emphasizing what he sees as his biggest selling point -- managing the unexpected, unwieldy problems that require a large-scale mobilization of resources and leadership that has been tested in moments of crisis.
At a moment when many Democratic voters seem to want a candidate with the passion and empathy that Mr. Bloomberg lacks, it is not clear that such a technocratic approach will work. And as Mr. Bloomberg makes his closing argument to voters ahead of the Super Tuesday contests -- the first time he will appear on the ballot this year -- he is not asking for love or adulation.
"You have to have the credibility that people believe you know what you're doing," Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview after he spoke to several hundred people in northeastern Tennessee on Friday. "Even if you didn't like me when I was in office -- and it's hard to believe but there were a couple people like that," he added, flashing a wry smile, "you at least thought that I was the adult in the room. And being the adult in the room is what's important."
His campaign has spent close to $ 1.5 million over the last two days alone broadcasting a commercial that extols his experience in managing crises, from ones that will likely seem familiar, like Hurricane Sandy, to ones that may seem more obscure, like the swine flu pandemic of 2009.
In the interview, he played down the significance of his widely panned debate performance in Nevada last week and swung hard at his Democratic rivals for lacking the experience and accomplishment that he has.
"I'm not running to be the college debater in chief," he said, "I'm running to be the commander in chief. I have the capability. I have been training for it for 20 years.
"Nobody else on that stage has any understanding of how to run something. They are all legislators and legislators don't have to give results. They pass bills that never get funded, never get enacted."
It's a make-or-break moment for Mr. Bloomberg, whose lavish spending and unconventional campaign strategy -- he is skipping the first four nominating states -- will get their first test at the ballot box on Tuesday. Polls show him garnering between 13 and 19 percent support nationally; two polls released Friday of California, Super Tuesday's biggest prize, showed him at 12 percent.
As he traveled across the South this week, Mr. Bloomberg tried to convey the part of his record that highlights the competence and cool-headedness he says are missing in the White House. On Friday, Mr. Bloomberg went after one of Mr. Trump's biggest vulnerabilities, the performance of the stock market, telling a crowd of several hundred in Memphis that the steep sell-off over the last several days was a direct result of the president's failure to reassure the country that he can lead.
Investors, he said, were "pricing the management incompetence" of Mr. Trump into trading, which has officially pushed the market into a correction -- a drop of 10 percent or more from its most recent peak.
"This week the stock market has plunged, partly out of fear but also because investors have no confidence that the president is capable of managing a crisis," Mr. Bloomberg said.
Mr. Bloomberg's record as mayor has been attacked during his time on the campaign trail by his critics and rivals, in part because of his own habit of making misleading statements about controversial policies such as the stop-and-frisk policing tactic. On the debate stage, other Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, laced into him over stop-and-frisk, his past misogynistic comments, and the nondisclosure agreements his company had struck with former employees.
Mr. Bloomberg had several major policy accomplishments during his tenure to point to, such as a ban on smoking in restaurants that led to a decline in smoking rates across the city, and restrictions on fatty foods sold in restaurants.
But he has been slow and sterile in his presentation of his bonafides, something that has privately frustrated some of his former aides from his mayoral days.
Whether his phlegmatic sales pitch, coming in the final week before Super Tuesday, will be enough to lift him up remains to be seen.
Kathy Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said that Mr. Bloomberg's struggles in selling his record as mayor simply reflect his lack of political dexterity.
"I think the essence is he's the anti-politician," said Ms. Wylde, who knew Mr. Bloomberg as mayor. "He essentially thinks that his record should speak for itself, and I don't think he feels the need to defend or explain himself. And that makes him a good professional manager and a poor political persona."
Mr. Bloomberg is an engineer by training. His fixation on the operational and logistical as mayor often came at the expense of political and emotional considerations. The slogan for his presidential campaign, "Mike Will Get It Done," reflects his head-over-heart, results-oriented approach to governing.
When he spoke to a crowd of several hundred in Bentonville, Ark., on Thursday night, Mr. Bloomberg elaborated on the meaning of "it" in his slogan.
"You've heard the slogan 'Mike Will Get It Done.' If you haven't, I've wasted a lot of money," he joked. (His spending on advertising in the race so far is more than half a billion dollars.)
"Let me tell you what 'it' is," Mr. Bloomberg went on. "'It' means beating Donald Trump in November, and sending him back to the golf course."

Texto completo: Rebekah Mercer, whose family foundation was a major Trump donor, stepped down from the museum when her term expired in December.
Rebekah Mercer, an influential donor to conservative causes -- including groups that deny climate science -- has quietly stepped down from the American Museum of Natural History, one of the country's most prominent science museums.
The museum, where Ms. Mercer served two three-year terms, said Thursday through a spokeswoman: "Ms. Mercer's term expired in December 2019 and her position on the board came to an end at that time."
Members may serve up to three consecutive terms; the museum did not say if Ms. Mercer had sought election to a third term. Ms. Mercer did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Her presence on the board prompted protests after The New York Times reported in 2017 that the Mercer Family Foundation -- which Ms. Mercer operates with her father, the New York investor Robert Mercer -- had given nearly $ 8 million to organizations including those that reject the scientific consensus on climate change. Among these beneficiaries are the Heartland Institute in Illinois and Breitbart News, the influential right-wing website that was run by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist.
As one of Mr. Trump's biggest donors, Ms. Mercer joined his transition team. Her family foundation has also been a generous supporter of the museum, giving a total of $ 1.4 million to the institution according to its three most recent tax returns.
In 2018 more than 200 scientists and other academics who have advocated policy action on climate change called on the museum to remove Ms. Mercer from its board and "end ties to anti-science propagandists and funders of climate science misinformation."
Last week, the advocacy group Revolting Lesbians trumpeted Ms. Mercer's departure on its Facebook page: "WE DID IT!" the post said. "This is a big deal because we are in a climate emergency, and a scientific institution has no place accepting money from and giving power and legitimacy to a mega-funder of climate science denial."

Texto completo: Readers critique how President Trump has reacted to the crisis and offer firsthand accounts of how people are coping with the disease in Asia.
To the Editor:
Re "Facing Potential Test in Public Trust" (news analysis, front page, Feb. 27):
In reaction to the Ebola crisis, Congress created a series of infectious disease centers with specialized equipment and highly trained teams of medical staff. The five-year funding for these centers is about to expire, and so far efforts to renew it are going nowhere (along with about 400 other bills passed by the House). President Trump got rid of two top officials in this medical chain of command two years ago and has yet to replace them.
Viruses aren't stopped by walls and they aren't intimidated by tweets. Keeping Americans safe from such threats requires vision, planning, persistence and working with other countries. Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans have demonstrated no interest in doing any of those things. God help us.

To the Editor:
Re "Vice President's Office to Control All Messaging on the Virus" (news article, Feb. 28):
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has spoken to the media in frank and honest terms about infectious diseases, including H.I.V./AIDS, influenza, measles, Ebola and, most recently, Covid-19. I read with alarm, therefore, that the "White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance."
We should all be terrified if President Trump is moving to silence the most trusted voice on infectious diseases in the world at a time when a growing epidemic is threatening the United States. Whom do you trust for information about your health: Dr. Fauci, or President Trump or Vice President Mike Pence?

To the Editor:
My wife and I have just returned from a three-week vacation to Singapore and Cambodia, returning through LAX airport on Feb. 20. We found Singapore itself to be spotless, with public health notices everywhere reminding people to follow basic hygiene protocols to prevent disease spread.
Most hotels in both Singapore and Siem Reap, Cambodia, had temperature monitoring, both at check-in and before entering common eating areas. Singapore Changi Airport had infrared temperature screening of all passengers entering the country. There were hand sanitizers everywhere and careful questioning at the airports both in Singapore and Cambodia about whether we had traveled to China in the past 14 days.
We arrived in Los Angeles to an immigration system that has clearly fallen apart -- 2,000 to 3,000 people lined up in close proximity, 90 percent with no masks and many with coughs. It took almost three hours. No questions about China travel in 14 days, no hand sanitizer available, customs officials with no gloves and greatly overworked.
We have self-quarantined ourselves for 14 days just in case we might be infectious, but this is not because of any public health guidance in the immigration process. It was very depressing to see the potential for the spread of the virus due to lack of foresight.

To the Editor:
Dear President Trump:
The emergence of the coronavirus has created an unprecedented opportunity for you to lead in a constructive way. As a New Yorker who followed your career, I was aware for decades that you abhorred the ritual of handshaking. It appears that you reluctantly took it up during your first campaign and in your role as president. This potential pandemic is an opportunity to convert the nation, and perhaps the world, to your way of thinking regarding this unsanitary ritual.
You can do so much good to help stop the spread of coronavirus by persuading people to adopt the fist bump or elbow bump, or, as some other cultures do, bowing. Your leadership on this issue can save many lives around the world.

To the Editor:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to stay home when you're sick and prepare for "significant disruption" to our lives with the likely spread of coronavirus in the United States. Yet for nearly seven in 10 workers who earn low wages -- and more than three in 10 over all -- doing just that can cost you your pay, and maybe your job. These are the workers who serve our food, drive our kids' school buses, care for our elderly loved ones.
It shouldn't take a pandemic to remind us that we all have a stake in a universal standard of paid sick days and paid family and medical leave.

To the Editor:
President Trump's response to the coronavirus virus is typical of him -- simply say a bunch of fluffy things. He is quoted as saying: "But we are very, very ready for this, for anything" and "We really have done a very good job." But he never backs up these statements with details.
What has he actually done to protect us? U.S. citizens deserve that information. Perhaps Mr. Trump simply doesn't know or doesn't really care.

To the Editor:
Re "City in South Korea Tries Openness, With Word of Caution About Crisis" (news article, Feb. 26):
I live in Daegu, Samsung's birthplace and the epicenter of Covid-19 in South Korea. Yes, the situation is grave; the number of cases here has topped 1,000. Since the unexpected outbreak in January, we have taken decisive pre-emptive measures while doctors and nurses do their job. We avoid one another. A controversy on whether to ban travelers from China aside, the government has responded rather systematically and decisively.
I have faith in the public sector and the medical system. The massive outbreak will hopefully reach an inflection point in a few weeks. We prevailed over SARS and MERS. Thanks to universal health care, it's cheap to test all residents with symptoms, another reason for so many infections having been identified.
A number of medical professionals -- 500 doctors in three days -- voluntarily stepped up to serve the isolated city. Some landlords have cut rent in half, or even exempted tenants, for those hit hard. This invisible enemy shall be overcome.

Texto completo: New evidence surfaced to show the 17th-century work had been owned by a Jewish art dealer who left it behind when he fled the Nazis.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art has altered the provenance of a major painting in one of its galleries to reflect new information about the artwork's troubled history in Germany before and after World War II.
The museum now acknowledges that the 17th-century painting, titled "The Rape of Tamar," and attributed to the French artist Eustache Le Sueur, was owned by a Jewish art dealer, Siegfried Aram, who fled Germany in 1933 as Hitler took power.
Mr. Aram fought for decades, unsuccessfully, to reclaim the painting, which he argued had been illegally taken by a businessman, Oskar Sommer, to whom he sold his home in Germany.
The dispute over the work was brought to light by Joachim Peter, a German researcher, photographer and art instructor, who has spent years studying the history of Heilbronn, the city where Mr. Aram once lived. The discovery by Mr. Peter, who has a diploma in film studies and an art degree, became the subject of a New York Times article earlier this month.
The Met bought the painting, which now hangs in Gallery 634, from a consortium of dealers in 1984. The dealers had purchased it months earlier at auction in London where Christie's had identified it as the "Property of a Gentleman" without additional provenance.
It had been brought to market by one of Mr. Sommer's daughters, who inherited the painting after his death in 1966.
Experts later traced the painting back to the 18th century where they identified two prior French owners. But the painting was mistakenly thought to have been in a private collection for more than 100 years until the 1983 sale at Christie's.
Actually, as referenced in the Met's new provenance for the work, it was held in a private collection in Britain in the mid-1920s when Mr. Aram bought it. The painting then passed "to Sommer as a contested part of his purchase of Aram's villa in Schapbach, Germany," the Met said on its website.
"We updated the online provenance information, with the confirmation that the painting in dispute between Aram and Sommers was the same as the Met's," the museum said in a statement.
Mr. Peter relied on documents from archives in Baden-Württemberg to track the dealer's long and unsuccessful fight for his painting. For his part, Mr. Sommer defended keeping the painting, asserting, among other things, that the property he bought was smaller than had been described.
It is unclear if Mr. Aram, who died in 1978 in the United States, has heirs. The Met declined to say whether anyone has come forward to make a claim on the painting.
Mr. Aram considered the subject of his painting to be a depiction of the "Tarquin and Lucretia" legend and he believed it had been created by the court painter for King Louis XIII of France, Simon Vouet, in whose studio Le Sueur had his early training.
It had been sold at Christie's as "Tarquin and Lucretia" by the "Circle of Simon Vouet." But the Met and other experts later came to believe that its subject is instead the Old Testament story of Tamar, by Le Sueur.

As the Coronavirus Spreads, 'The Daily' Goes Back to Basics

Texto completo: We usually tell stories. This called for something different.
From the start of the coronavirus outbreak, "The Daily" has devoted several episodes to the epidemic, recounting the story of the virus's journey across China and exploring how the Chinese government's approach seemed to worsen the crisis.
By the middle of this week, as the virus started to spread across the Middle East and Europe, we debated the best way to tell the story. We typically build episodes around a narrative, emphasizing characters, drama and ideas. But this situation was different. The virus had become an epidemic on an increasingly global scale. It required something else.
Executive producer Lisa Tobin proposed the audio equivalent of an F.A.Q. about the coronavirus, a break in our normal form. Our producer, Alexandra Leigh Young, who works closely with The Times's Science desk, hunted for the right guest: somebody who could explain the disease in simple terms and put the epidemic into historical context.
Soon enough, Alexandra was on the phone with Donald G. McNeil Jr., a reporter with decades of experience covering epidemics from SARS to MERS to Zika. We asked him every question we had about the coronavirus. Why is this virus so contagious? How does it spread? Who gets it? Who dies from it? Is there a cure?
And of course, this: Just how scared should we be?
Donald did not mince words.
"If things don't change, a lot of us might die," he told us.
He had chosen his words carefully.
"I spend a lot of time thinking about whether I'm being too alarmist or whether I'm being not alarmist enough," he said in the interview.
Many of you have written to us -- and Donald -- to say how grateful you were for his explanations.
As the epidemic spreads and, according to public health officials, likely intensifies in the United States, we will keep trying to find ways to document and explain it in ways that are calm, candid and lucid, no matter what the information may be.
Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .
The question of masks
We asked Donald G. McNeil Jr., our reporter on Thursday's episode about the coronavirus , for some clarity about what we should and shouldn't be doing with masks.
Do masks work?
It depends. Masks keep the droplets from a sick person's coughs and sneezes in so that others don't catch them.
But flat surgical masks don't help people stay healthy, because air can get in around the edges, and because they encourage people to fiddle with their faces to adjust their masks.
More important than a mask is washing your hands a lot, using hand sanitizer and keeping your fingers away from your eyes, nose and mouth. You're more likely to pick up the flu from touching some surface than from a droplet drifting through the air.
Should I buy masks?
Don't go buy N-95 masks. The country's limited supply of N-95 masks will be needed by doctors and nurses, who have to change masks frequently, or they risk spreading the virus from infected patients to uninfected ones.
The only non-medical people who need to wear masks are sick people, not well ones. Anybody who's sick would ideally stay inside, and if they have to leave the house, wear a mask.
People who really feel better wearing a mask should wear the big cloth ones that cover their whole chin and the bottom of their face. (You can even sew your own.) These masks are harder to stick a finger inside and risk touching your nose or mouth. Plus, you can wash and reuse them.
You can find the latest updates on the coronavirus here , and more information about how to prepare here .
Indecision in South Carolina
On today's episode of "The Field," producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Annie Brown traveled to South Carolina with Astead Herndon, a politics reporter for The Times. The team met with black community leaders, whose support is crucial for winning the state's primary.
As Astead points out in the episode, "Year after year, black voters have largely coalesced around a singular Democratic candidate." And yet, this doesn't seem to be the case in South Carolina.
Clare has been following the campaign trail through Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and now South Carolina. "Over the past year, candidates have directed much of their energy on the early voting states," she told us. "In spite of this, we're still seeing so many undecided voters."
Annie agreed. "Something that's so fascinating is how many people don't know who they're voting for as they're driving to the polls. Ultimately, they have to make a game-time decision. The forces that drive them in the voting booth are kind of mysterious."
You can listen to the story here or by searching for "The Field" wherever you get your podcasts.
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: "This is the first time that a major investor has genuinely taken on the issue of climate change." Andrew Ross Sorkin on why several major American corporations have recently introduced new climate initiatives -- and whether they'll actually have an impact.
Tuesday: "The jury is making its decisions based on whether they believe these women's stories or not." Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the reporters who first broke the Harvey Weinstein story, cover the verdict in his criminal trial.
Wednesday: U.S. intelligence officials say that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election by supporting two very different candidates: President Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders. David Sanger explains.
Thursday: Donald G. McNeil Jr. breaks down what we know about the coronavirus and the threat it poses to the United States.
Friday: On an episode of "The Field," we head to South Carolina with Astead Herndon. Joe Biden has staked his presidential candidacy on winning that state's primary, but will voters turn out for him?

Texto completo: Growing up in California, Orion Tait used to watch his father's weekend housekeeping routine.
"Sunday was loud music - Neil Young - and my dad going around watering the plants," Tait recalled. "He had a deck of plants growing everywhere. It was a ritual."
Tait, a creative director and partner at Buck, a production company, tried to carry on that tradition as an adult in his Brooklyn home, complete with the loud rock. But he and his wife, Amy Won, were too busy to care for their houseplants. They never got around to repotting them. Fungus gnats colonized.
"I was, like, this is New York City," Tait said. "There's got to be someone we can hire."
That someone was Lisa Muñoz. For $2,000, Muñoz will come fill your house with plants and make it look beautiful. You can spend more than $2,000, but you cannot spend less; that's the minimum fee charged by her Brooklyn-based firm, Leaf and June.
That covers the design, plants, potting, delivery of plants and a detailed care guide, Muñoz said. "You don't have to call an Uber XL to transport your big tree home," she said. "We do all the dirty work for you."
If Muñoz, 38, sounds practiced at selling her services, it's because her job title - interior plant designer - usually requires explanation. It's an emerging career; she has been doing it for six years.
Nurseries and flower shops have long provided professional plant care for offices and homes. Muñoz offers such maintenance services to her clients too.
But her real role is in performing the job that a fashion stylist or art consultant might - to make aesthetic choices and sound investments on someone's behalf. Just ... about plants.
The fascination with houseplants has begun to spawn all manner of specialists.
After he began posting photos of his Baltimore home to Instagram three years ago, and talking about the 200 plants that fill the lush rooms, Hilton Carter became a bit of a celebrity. He published a book, "Wild at Home: How to Style and Care for Beautiful Plants," and, he says, created a new occupation.
"I'm not going to lie to you - I believe I was the first person to ever say I was a plant stylist," said Carter, 40, who worked at an ad agency before dedicating himself to houseplants. "I just ran with it. That's awesome that it's now a job title."
These days, Carter is too busy with his other plant gigs (he has a new book coming out this spring, "Wild Interiors," with a promotional tour to follow) to do much styling, he said.
Maryah Greene, who runs the one-woman firm Greene Piece, bills herself as New York City's "Plant Doctor & Stylist." She is the fiddle-leaf-fig whisperer for the rest of us: She charges a flat hourly rate of between $125 and $175. Her clients are largely renters who want to introduce a little greenery into their lives but don't know a pothos plant from a bird of paradise, much less how to not kill them.
"A lot of what I do I like to think of as confidence boosting," said Greene, 24, who has plant-styled for more than a year and has met with about 50 clients so far.
The confidence they crave requires counsel: Will a monstera be happy by the radiator? Can sunshine-loving cactuses thrive in a light-starved apartment? What's the best pot to show off the pink and white leaves of hoya carnosa?
More plant money,
more plant problems
One wonders why a plant stylist is needed in the first place. The library is still free.
Yet in the age of the gig economy, where freelancers and consultants exist to fulfill every life need, and hiring out a task can be preferable to learning how to do it yourself, houseplant decisions are just another thing to outsource.
The plant stylists say most people's ability to properly choose and care for houseplants is woeful, even as the reported desire to live among them is high.
"One of the biggest questions I get from clients is, 'What plant can I get that would be good with no light?' " Muñoz said. "No light? That's actually not possible."
John Fraser, a chef, hired Muñoz to rescue his neglected houseplants, which "were on death's door," and to create a potted greenscape on the balcony of his apartment. "I wanted someone who could give me the answers that you probably learn over time," he said. "Because of travel and restaurant stuff, I'm not the best caretaker."
Meeting with a plant stylist is "a really intimate service," Greene said, and thus caters to the still would-be plant parent. "I can't provide you with the right plants unless I know who you are, what your work schedule is like, your history with plants."
No doctorate required
A four-year degree in horticulture or botany isn't necessary to style plants. Greene was earning her master's in education and literacy and hanging around plant shops when she realized she could make money from her hobby.
In 2013, Muñoz earned her certificate in horticulture from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and began working part time at plant shops to further educate herself. Her business was born in 2014.
Muñoz recently installed 115 potted plants in Buck's large, light-filled offices overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront, at the behest of Tait and his partners. Soon after, she said, the company asked for a proposal to add more plants.
"I think people are really just wanting things that make them happy. And things that are alive ... ," Muñoz said, trailing off.
She considered her curious role. "I mean, have you ever heard of plants making people mad?"

Texto completo: Buttons, shirts and bumper stickers heralding the failed presidential ambitions of Sen. Kamala Harris are gathering dust inside a warehouse in Texas.
Among lava lamps and incense sticks, a retailer in Connecticut still offers shirts that cry "Jeb!"
And for years after Mitt Romney's 2012 quest for the White House ended, fading campaign hats and shirts resurfaced on the streets of Kenya's capital, Nairobi.
For decades, U.S. presidential campaigns have churned out enormous quantities of swag - $5 buttons, $15 mugs, $75 guacamole bowls - to promote candidates, fill campaign coffers and gather sophisticated data about supporters.
Less attention has been paid, however, to what happens to all those things after most of those campaigns end, sometimes abruptly.
Many campaigns do not have a plan for what they leave behind.
"You literally go from building a multimillion-dollar startup to being shut down overnight," said Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 campaign, which gave many leftover shirts to volunteers. "It's a lot easier to have people help you when you win to shut down a campaign."
Surplus items often end up in storage or in the homes of staff members and volunteers. Some are given a second life with a new campaign. Most are thought to be recycled or thrown away.
"If somebody doesn't deliberately collect them or hold on to them, almost all of it disappears," said Jon Grinspan, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History who collects presidential campaign memorabilia for the museum.
The Harris campaign placed a bulk order for merchandise in the summer, said Shelby Cole, who was digital director of Harris' campaign. The plan was to distribute the items to campaign teams nationwide. But before they could, Harris, a senator from California, dropped out.
"All of our staff was pretty much caught by total surprise," Cole said. "I was just thinking, 'Oh my God, what are we going to do with all these shirts?' "
Cole said that the vendor the Harris campaign had hired, Bumperactive, offered to store the items in a warehouse and that they had been there for months. The merchandise is not marked with the year 2020, so it could in theory be used for Harris' future campaigns, Cole said.
Harris' office said there were plans to recycle the items but offered no specifics. Kyle Johnson, owner of Bumperactive, declined to comment.
At times, vendors that print shirts and other items are left with the surplus stock. The retailer in Connecticut, Old Glory, still offers items printed for Jeb Bush, John McCain and other bygone candidates.
"It's just in our warehouse, sitting on a shelf," said Austin Braumann, a district manager for Old Glory. "What ends up happening is you either leave it up online and you can sell it, or you can donate it or throw it away."
Several hundred shirts and hats promoting Romney's 2012 presidential campaign wound up in Kenya after a former county campaign director in Tennessee donated the items to a charity run by his aunt.
The former campaign official, Alexander Waters, recalled thinking after the election, "Instead of someone selling them on eBay for $5 down the road, how can we turn this boon into something that can change someone's life?"
In 2013, Waters delivered the clothes to his aunt's charity, the Orbit Village Project, which has been operating in Kenya for more than 20 years. His aunt, Cyndy Waters, said she saw people wearing Romney hats for years.
"Kenyans are very much in tune to what's going on in American elections, so they knew Romney," she said.
Jason Worrix, marketing director for My Campaign Store, a company in Louisville, Kentucky, said he advises that leftover goods be donated to local organizations. Signs can be painted over by Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, pens can go to bars and restaurants, clothing to shelters or Goodwill.
Sometimes, campaigns reuse the material, Worrix said. Small changes can turn a yard sign for a congressional campaign into a yard sign promoting a run for governor or president, he said, and if a T-shirt or mug shows only a candidate's name, it can be reused every election cycle.
"Politicians, a lot of times they're lifers," he said. "Especially for yard signs and things, we print a lot of stickers that say 'reelect,' or cover up positions and years to modify what they're running for."
But there is no consistent practice of giving to charity, as the NFL does with the premade, "winning" merchandise of teams that lose in the Super Bowl.
Some campaigns keep their stores open; sales can help pay the bills or generate income to finance a future race. Zach Graumann, campaign manager for Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who ended his long-shot bid for president last month, said Yang merchandise would remain available until whatever was left sold out.
The National Museum of American History has about 130,000 items that showcase American political history, most of which came from campaigns. Grinspan, who has been a curator at the museum for five years, said that snagging items before they got tossed could be a challenge and that "99%" of items were thrown away.
Sometimes, collecting can mean sifting through recycling bins or piles of discarded material. In most cases, volunteers and staff members willingly share campaign merchandise.
Curators gathered a few dozen posters and buttons in New Hampshire while attending political rallies and visiting campaign headquarters, said Claire Jerry, another curator at the museum.
Jerry said the museum also received older items from people who had packed them away at home and forgotten about them. The museum recently obtained a torch used in Abraham Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign that had been sitting in the attic of a small historical society in Milford, New Hampshire, Grinspan said.
"A lot of these things come from people's junk drawers," Jerry said.
Lori Ferber Collectibles in Scottsdale, Arizona, has been gathering campaign ephemera from elections, administrations, manufacturers and estate sales for over 40 years, said Steve Ferber, the company's vice president.
The company, which specializes in presidential and presidential campaign memorabilia, recently bought and sold about 160,000 Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan buttons that one manufacturer had sitting in a warehouse since the 1970s and '80s, Ferber said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - House Democrats are scrutinizing whether President Donald Trump has improperly interfered at the Justice Department for political reasons, a prominent committee chairman said Friday, requesting documents and interviews with more than a dozen U.S. attorneys related to the cases of three Trump associates and a review of the FBI's Russia inquiry.
The requests are the first major return to politically charged oversight matters by the House Judiciary Committee since it helped impeach Trump late last year. But with House leaders intent on shifting attention toward domestic policy legislation they believe will help preserve their majority in this fall's election, it was not clear how far Democrats would be willing to escalate a likely fight.
Officials were careful Friday not to characterize the requests as the beginning of a new investigation, instead framing them as routine oversight. They come as Trump has moved aggressively in the wake of his impeachment acquittal to insert himself into Justice Department business.
"These circumstances are deeply troubling," Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee chairman, wrote in a letter to William Barr, the attorney general. "Although you serve at the president's pleasure, you are also charged with the impartial administration of our laws. In turn, the House Judiciary Committee is charged with holding you to that responsibility."
Nadler asked for materials related to a handful of criminal cases, including the sentencing of Roger Stone, antitrust matters and a review by John Durham into the roots of Robert Mueller's investigation into 2016 Russian election interference and the Trump campaign. Democrats believe Durham's inquiry is designed to undermine Mueller's findings.
In most of the cases under scrutiny, Trump has blurred the lines that traditionally separate the White House from criminal enforcement matters, offering running commentary or outright rooting for a result on Twitter and in public comments. Documentary records and interviews with prosecutors could definitively show whether the department acted based on Trump's statements or if the White House at any point issued more direct orders in private.
In the case of Stone, the president's remarks on Twitter blasting the judge and Justice Department lawyers for recommending what he said was too harsh a sentence for his longtime friend and campaign adviser went so far that Barr delivered an extraordinary public rebuke, but only after senior department officials intervened to reverse the recommendation of career prosecutors and suggest a shorter sentence.
The attorney general said earlier this month that he would not be "bullied" into any result and warned that the president's tweets made it "impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity."
Although tensions have eased somewhat in recent weeks, Barr remains in a precarious position. Trump has largely defied his request, continuing to tweet about the Stone case and forcing Barr to contemplate what it would take for him to resign. The Judiciary Committee's scrutiny could only make things more difficult for the attorney general, whose actions have drawn intense criticism inside and outside the Justice Department for politicizing the law enforcement system.
Nadler cited those tensions as he asked for the materials by mid-March so the committee could study the matter before a planned hearing with Barr on March 31.
If history is any guide, though, the exchange will not be an easy one. The department generally opposes handing over files related to ongoing matters, especially to lawmakers of another party, though it has made exceptions. And Nadler and Barr have particularly bad blood, stemming from the attorney general's handling of the special counsel's investigation.

Fear Itself Is the Biggest Coronavirus Danger; Trump is vilified for singing from the same hymnal as Democrats in New York and California.

Texto completo: A fascinating story in the New York Times almost 20 years ago featured the headline "Nuns Offer Clues to Alzheimer's and Aging." Key evidence consisted of essays written by the nuns when they were young, which suggested that " 'idea density,' many thoughts woven into a small number of words, [was] a trait correlating closely with nuns who later escaped Alzheimer's."
That study has come back to me often. Columnists who fasten their well-worn anti-Trump talking points to every news event in our ever-interesting world are not bringing value to their readers. They banalize our world, empty it of interest and meaning. If the nun story is correct, they should worry about Alzheimer's.
The world may be embarked on an experiment. A global economy in which millions are employed and sustained by trade and travel is threatened with lockdown. The U.S. is headed toward a presidential election in which the usual crowding together for debates, meetings and conventions may be discouraged.
Donald Trump's successful 2016 campaign consisted largely of raucous rallies. Bernie Sanders is becoming no slouch at the same. If that's off the table now, does it mean Mike Bloomberg's ad-heavy approach gets a second life? Even more so if management skills are suddenly in demand among voters amid coronavirus-spawned chaos?
And what if none of this disorder is even warranted?
"Once widely criticized, the Wuhan quarantine bought the world time to prepare for Covid-19" says a headline in the medical publication Statnews. Read further, though, for the piling up of doubts about whether the costs were worth the benefit of slowing the spread of a disease that may be no worse than the flu.
In the U.S., influenza infects upward of 29 million a year, yet less than half of us bother to get a flu vaccine. We don't wash our hands or take other precautions religiously, though we may do so now under bombardment of coronavirus warnings.
When President Trump said at his press conference Wednesday that the disease might or might not become a big deal, he was faithfully encompassing the scientific possibilities. The press shrieked that he was misleading the public, never mind that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was saying exactly the same thing. "We can really keep this thing contained," he said at his own press briefing on Wednesday, and if a serious outbreak should occur, "we've got a long time to ramp up if we ever had anything like that."
Ditto the governor of California, also a Democrat, whose state may have identified the first truly domestic case. He said one day after the president spoke: "This is not our first great challenge as it relates to public health. . . . These protocols have been perfected."
Note the following carefully: To optimize the outcome of this difficult situation—neither overkill nor underkill—the crux will be giving the American people an accurate picture of the risks so they can accurately judge the costs they should be willing to bear to reduce those risks.
Just how deadly is Covid-19 compared with the flu, which kills about 0.16% of its victims (including 125 children so far this season)? On Tuesday, the World Health Organization's Bruce Aylward, having returned from a painstakingly negotiated visit to Wuhan, seemed to argue for accepting the Chinese figure of roughly 2%. But remember Stalin's quip about the pope's army: The WHO is dependent on China's goodwill, has little power to coerce China, and understands how readily Beijing might cut off cooperation in a fit of neo-Maoism.
Mr. Aylward's view is strongly disputed by many other experts. In the chaos of Wuhan, they suspect China missed thousands of mild cases while also letting dozens die who would have lived with proper advice and care. Numerous have been the press reports of elderly victims expiring at home after being turned away from hospitals.
Here's my guess (and it's just a guess): Once authorities in the U.S. start looking seriously for domestic Covid-19, they are bound to find it. The pillorying of California for not detecting its case sooner is really just evidence of how slow the media has been to grasp the Covid-19 challenge. Which of the million-plus people who come down with flu symptoms each week should be given the expensive, hard-to-obtain test? Which of the thousands who check into hospitals with generic breathing difficulties?
At the same time, America is entering the final month of peak flu season. This year's has already been only about two-thirds as deadly as the 2017-18 season, in which 79,400 died. Americans may actually end up having a safer flu season overall. Heightened precautions taken against Covid-19 will also inhibit the spread of more familiar flu and coronavirus strains.
And once America has Covid-19 in perspective, scientists can turn their attention back to those urgent Alzheimer's studies.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netfllx offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but It seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"Ali this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Relndl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year, and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows like "Atlanta" on FX and "Silicon Valley" on HBO.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product the/ can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephan: Pictures, a production company in Chicago. "I couldn't keep this company together if it was fewer than eight, and it's coming."
In addition to shortening season lengths, the streaming platforms have ignored the school-year-style calendar of television's network days, with its premieres Ir the weeks after Labor Day and finales late in the spring. Netfllx has served up new seasons of Its most-watched program, "Stranger Things," in July. Apple TV Plus unveiled one of its most-hyped shows, "Little America," in the middle of January.
The rise of streaming has fattened the wallets of superstar writer-producers like Shonda Rh mes and Ryan Murphy, while also g ving chances to unproven writers But the medium's shorter seasons and unpreclctable cadences have made it harder for writers in Hollywood's middle class to plot out a year's work in a way that doesn't leave them rervous when mortgage payments are due.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours, and they complained to their union representatives.
"Five years ago, it grew from an iso ated problem to a dominant problem," said Chuck Slocum, assistant executive director of the Writers Guild of America, West. "We had ha f of our members wake up and realize one day that they're making half the money that they were making."
The union worked out some protections for its members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
That change kicked In too late to help Lila Byock, a writer whose credits include HBO's "The Leftovers" and Hulu's "Castle Rock." She said she was hired on a scripted series that she figured would last 10 months. Instead, it took nearly 18 months, which caused her to pass on other writing jobs.
"It gets tricky," Byock said. "That wasn't what I had budgeted for two years of my life."
On the flip side, streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year, but that's not enough time to take on another show," said Conrad, of Elephant Pictures.
The old TV calendar is not quite dead. Major producers of network shows, like Dick Wolf and Chuck Lorre, still must come up with at least 22 episodes per season of shows like NBC's "Chicago P.D." and CBS' "Young Sheldon." But with new streaming platforms like NBCUniversal's Peacock and HBO Max set to start in the spring, the lives of many TV writers are likely to get more chaotic.
"I have friends working in network television and it's like they're on a different planet," said Harley Peyton, a writer and co-executive producer of "Project Blue Book," a History Channel series with 10 episodes a season.
He described staff positions on network shows as "the last full-time jobs in this business," adding that "those jobs are extraordinarily difficult to get."
The 10 established Hollywood writers who discussed the changes In the Industry with The New York Times were careful to point out that they were still able to make good money, even amid the digital dis- ruptlon of their industry. And yet, they said, it is common for veteran writers these days to be paid as if they were rookies.
Jonathan Shikora, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents actors and writers, suggested that longtime TV writers were now underpaid. "Should I be getting the same as some new writer whose script I'm rewriting because their work Is so green and new and I'm teaching that person?" he asked.
The new economy has some writers thinking twice about moving up the ranks to the position of executive producer. "What I'm starting to see is a lot of friends being like, 'Why would I ever want to be a showrunner?"' Byock said, referring to the hands-on executive producer in charge of the writers' room. "If you're making the same amount you could be making doing a much less stressful job, why wouldn't you just do that?"
Rob Long, once a writer and an executive producer of the long-running NBC sitcom "Cheers," said he had tried to make allowances for the changes when he was in charge of "Sullivan & Son," a TBS sitcom.
That show had 10 episodes in its first two seasons and 13 in its third, a significant change from the 28-episode final season of "Cheers." That was fine with the financially secure Long, who said, "I got to be honest, I thought it was fantastic." The difficulty came when he was hiring staff writers.
"I was making deals with younger writers just starting out," he said, "and I was doing the math."
It took eight weeks to write the scripts and prepare for shooting. An additional 15 weeks brought the staff to the end of the production. The schedule meant that "Sullivan & Son" would eat up nearly six months of staff writers' time.
Under the terms of their contracts, they had to give priority to "Sullivan & Son," meaning that, if the show got renewed, they were obligated to go back to it even if they were working on another project.
"It was a de facto way of locking you up," Long said.
So he came up with an informal solution that he has used on other shows since then.
"We make a private, handshake deal with our writers," he said. "We tell them that if you get on another project, or you sell a pilot or something else happens, I will let you out of your contract," he said.
In other words, Long added, "I promise to fire the writer."

Texto completo: Charles Hobson, an Emmy Award-winning producer who helped shatter racial stereotypes by delivering a Black perspective that had been missing from early television programming, died on Thursday, Feb. 13, 2020, in the Bronx, New York. He was 83.
His daughter Halbe Spencer Hobson confirmed his death, from heart failure, in a hospital.
Hobson, who lived in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, was instrumental in the success of the groundbreaking series "Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant" and "Like It Is," which introduced white audiences to everyday life in Black communities. Those places had been largely invisible, or defined by negative images, during the first decades of TV's evolution.
His programs not only provided a singular perspective on contemporary issues; they also gave an unfiltered voice to people who had been neglected when television was struggling through its adolescence.
"Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant," which ran from 1968 until 1970 on WNEW-TV in New York, has been called the city's first regular program written, produced and presented by Black people.
"Here was not a 'ghetto' filled with enraged protesters and rioters," Charles Musser, who teaches film and media at Yale University, has written. "Here were people struggling to live their lives with dignity, grace and ambition."
The show's 52 half-hour episodes featured entertainers like Eubie Blake, Harry Belafonte and drummer Max Roach; champion pool player Cisero Murphy; and uncelebrated local teachers, police officers and street performers. It was broadcast at 1 a.m. and 7 a.m. but still managed to find an audience. Social historians regard it as a vital video time capsule of an urban neighborhood.
"This was a way for Blacks to hear their voices," Hobson told The New York Times in 1998. "Here's a community of about 400,000 people at that time, with all of their culture and churches, and no coverage."
"People spoke their hearts and their minds," he said of the residents featured on the program. "They didn't know how to do anything else at that time because there weren't any models."
Hobson had an impact not only on Black audiences but also on white viewers, who were introduced to people, places and problems they might not have contemplated before.
Rhea L. Combs, supervisory curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History & Culture, said in an email that Hobson "gave voice to Black communities at a time their issues, triumphs and concerns were either ignored or misrepresented in mainstream media."
Hobson was also the first Black producer of the WABC-TV program "Like It Is," another early public affairs program that focused on minority issues. "Like It Is" won seven local Emmy Awards.
He produced the 13-week PBS series "From Jumpstreet: A Story of Black Music" (1980) and the nine-part PBS-BBC co-production "The Africans" (1986).
In 1989, he was hired to be the director of market planning for WNET, the New York public television station.
In the 1980s he began Vanguard Documentaries, which produced "Porgy and Bess: An American Voice" (1998) and "Harlem in Montmartre: Paris Jazz" (2009) for "Great Performances" on PBS.

Texto completo: TAMPA

I am my own happiness dealer, said Gregory Siff as he spoke from the podium when he began his artist talk at the Tampa Museum of Art on Feb. 13.

For the Brooklyn-born, L.A.-based artist, painting has been a path to nirvana since he started doing it every day 10 years ago. He paints a code of symbols in storyboards to record his lifes journey, capturing emotions and memories and often incorporating images from childhood.

And for the month of February, hes been laser-focused on completing a body of work while in residency at Tampa gallery Cass Contemporary, culminating with a solo exhibition, Evidence of Life, that opens today and remains on view through April.

Im doing new things in this show that Ive never done that will be indicative of Tampa, he said. And everything is full of so much meaning. I want to leave as much of a mark as I can. Thats why I called the show Evidence of Life. 

Cass owners Jake and Cassie Greatens first discovered Siffs work about seven years ago when they acquired one of his pieces for a collector. Over the years, Siffs star had begun to rise in the L.A. contemporary art scene, and the Greatenses kept an eye on his career. He participated in the 2017 exhibition Paint It Forward at Cass.

Siffs story is somewhat of an art world fairy tale. Having grown up in the theater, he had moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting. He got some jobs, but it wasnt the career hed hoped for. He said that forced him to get creative. After meeting some artist friends, he committed himself to painting every day, a practice he maintains. He was eventually noticed by a gallery, and the owner became his manager.

Now his work is in prestigious collections and featured in publications including the New York Times and Interview magazine. He has also ventured into the world of high fashion, collaborating with Yves Saint Laurent on its Winter 2017-18 line, as well as other commercial partnerships.

Ive been rooting for Gregory from

the get-go, just because personally hes so genuine, Jake Greatens said in a phone interview. But its also his process that is genuine, like directly from his brain to the canvas.

While Siff was never classically trained as an artist, he was exposed to art at a young age. He recalls his parents taking him to the famous New York City restaurant Mr. Chow, where Andy Warhols drawing of a hamburger

puzzled him but was his first introduction to pop art. Other influences include Keith Haring and Jean Michel Basquiat, whose works he could see on the streets growing up.

During his residency, Siff has given talks at the Tampa Museum of Art and the University of Tampa. He also painted a 26-foot-tall mural on Tampas new co-working and event space Hyde House, his largest to date. He said he has a lot of love here between friends and the artists and collectors who have been dropping by the gallery to check out his progress.

I always say hes a triple threat, Cassie Greatens said. Hes got the talent, but he also has the passion. Everythings organic and from the heart. And then he has the connectivity factor, which I think is huge for collectors.

Tampa has offered Siff a few firsts. He had never spoken about his artistic process in a museum before the Tampa Museum of Art, and the residency itself is the longest one he has done. He said that the experience has given him the ability to focus and really stretch.

He brought one of his completed pieces to the museum, which he explained prior to his artist talk. Its titled How Do You Tell a Girl Shes Beautiful? In this case, she is Tampa. He painted Tampa icons, including the minarets, grand oaks with Spanish moss and a rooster, symbolic of Ybor City, all dripping in watercolor, to give the impression of fleeting memories. He integrates his own personal symbols, like his fathers ring that he wears. There is a blending imagery of objects from the museums collection of antiquities with icons of the modern world, with emojis.

Siff said his intention is to combine genres of ancient and modern. His paintings are at once visions of the past, present and future.

Theres power in the stories of the past and sometimes were so trying to be ahead of everything. If we look back to myth and legend, you can make meaning out of someone elses meaning.

Some commonsense tips to prepare for the spread of coronavirus

Texto completo: No confirmed cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus have been reported yet in Minnesota, but that will most likely change in the coming weeks.
As Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) told Star Tribune reporter Jeremy Olson, trying to prevent the spread of such a virus is “like trying basically to stop the wind.”
“We need to really get away from the idea of containment, which can’t happen, and focus more on mitigation,” Osterholm added.
Health care officials and personnel throughout the state are already taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 when it does hit Minnesota, but individuals need to prepare as well.
“It’s very likely that COVID-19 could actually affect our daily lives as Minnesotans,” said Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious diseases at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), in an interview with KARE 11 reporter Alex Hagan.
What should we, as individuals, be doing? Well, we shouldn’t be panicking about the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in our communities, but we should be prepared.
A slew of good articles on how individuals should make those preparations have been published in the national press in recent days. Most of the advice involves simple, commonsense tips — the same ones health experts recommend for avoiding the flu each year.
One of the most basic — and most effective — of those tips is also one that most people either overlook or don’t do properly, as Gina Kolata of the New York Times reports:
During the SARS epidemic — also caused by a coronavirus, but one that was much deadlier — hand-washing reduced the risk of transmission by 30 to 50 percent. …
The thing is, Americans aren’t very good at it.
Wet your hands with clean running water and then lather them with soap; don’t miss the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. (Parents sometimes tell children that this is about the time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.)
Finally, rinse your hands well with clean, running water. Dry them with a clean towel or let them air dry.
If it is not feasible to wash your hands with water, you can use a hand sanitizer, but check the label to be sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol.
Squirt the gel onto your palms, rub your hands together, and then rub the gel all over your hands and fingers until your hands are dry. This step should take about 20 seconds, as well.
Kolata also points out the importance of taking the symptoms of a viral infection seriously — whether those symptoms appear in others or in yourself:
Americans often disregard colds and flus, continuing about their ordinary business until the infection worsens. And many people who work in minimum-wage jobs do not get sick days. Sometimes they must work even when ill, despite the fact that they have a lot of contact with the public.
The upshot is that there are often people with symptoms in public places — and without apology, you should put distance between you and them. Try for six feet, but even a little distancing is helpful.
“If you see someone on a bus who is coughing, move away,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, an infectious disease and coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa.
And do your colleagues a favor if you aren’t feeling well: Stay home from work. Please.
Experts do not advise, however, stocking up on surgical facemasks. You don’t need to wear them unless you’re sick, as a team of Washington Post journalists report:
“The main point of the mask is to keep someone who is infected with the virus from spreading it to others,” [said Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles].
The CDC agrees, writing on its website: “CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases.”
Common surgical masks block the droplets coming out of a sick person from getting into the air, but they are not tight enough to prevent what’s already in the air from getting in.
There are specialized masks — known as N95 masks because they filter out 95 percent of airborne particles — that are more effective, and some online retailers are sold out of them. But there’s a problem: The masks are difficult to use without training. They must be fitted and tested to work properly.
And what about stocking up on food and medicines? Writes NPR’s Maria Godoy:
The reason to stock up on certain products now isn’t so much to avoid potential shortages in the event of an outbreak but to practice what experts call social distancing. Basically, you want to avoid crowds to minimize your risk of catching the disease. If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, the last place you want to be is in line at a crowded grocery store or drugstore.
If you take daily medications — for example, blood pressure pills — make sure you have enough to last a couple of weeks, suggests Katz, as long as you can get approval for an extended supply from your insurance provider.
Also worth pre-buying: fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, says Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician with Columbia University Medical Center.
Think about adding enough nonperishable foods to your pantry to carry you through for a couple of weeks, adds Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.
Bracho-Sanchez suggests having on hand your go-to sickbed foods, like chicken or vegetable broth and crackers in case of illness, as well as hydrating drinks such as Gatorade and Pedialyte for kids (though so far, kids seem less vulnerable to COVID-19).
That’s because if you do get sick, you want to be ready to ride it out at home if need be. So far, 80% of COVID-19 cases have been mild. (Think cold or flu symptoms.)
For more information: You’ll find more information and tips about preparing for COVID-19 within the articles cited above. You can also keep up to date with what’s going on in Minnesota regarding COVID-19 at the MDH’s website. CIDRAP has also recently launched a COVID-19 resource page, where you can find updated news and information on the virus.

Texto completo: Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week: the upcoming South Carolina primary; Minnesota still has caucuses (kind of); and Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s background as a prosecutor.
Let’s get on with this.
South Carolina
The South Carolina primary is on Saturday. And with it, 54 of the Democratic Party’s 3,979 delegates are in play.
Real Clear Politics places Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s polling average at 3 percent, behind Joe Biden (34), Sen. Bernie Sanders (20), Tom Steyer (14), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (8), and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (6). FiveThirtyEight says the senator “has a <1 in 100 (0%) chance of winning the most votes.”
Klobuchar has struggled to make any gains with black voters, who make up a majority of Democratic voters in the state. Nonetheless, after a sixth-place finish in Nevada, Klobuchar remained upbeat.
“As usual, we have exceeded expectations,” she said to a crowd of supporters in Minneapolis last weekend. “A lot of people didn’t even think I would still be standing at this point. They didn’t think I’d make it through that speech in the snow.”
Minnesota’s caucuses
Minnesota’s caucuses were held on Tuesday. But as MinnPost’s Peter Callaghan explains: “This year’s gatherings [had] nothing to do with which presidential candidates win delegates to each party’s national nominating conventions. In fact, there [were] no votes taken in any form at the caucuses — no straw poll, show of hands, applause meters — to indicate how many attendees support the presidential candidates.”
You can (and should) read more at MinnPost.
Klobuchar the prosecutor
In the middle of the Democratic primary, Klobuchar’s record has drawn significantly more scrutiny than in prior months.
The New York Times has a piece on Klobuchar’s votes for President Trump’s judicial nominees. Reading it gave me a bit of déjà vu, but the point still stands: Klobuchar’s voting record was, until she ran for president, out of step with her Democratic colleagues running for president.
At the same time, Klobuchar’s past as a prosecutor has continued to haunt the candidate’s run. The Minneapolis NAACP and other groups are still calling for her to exit the race because of her handling of the case of Myon Burrell , a then-teenager who was accused of murdering Tynesha Edwards , an 11-year-old girl. Burrell was given a life sentence during Klobuchar’s tenure as County Attorney, but a recent AP investigation questioned the evidence and the way the case was handled.
Burrell did get a second trial, after Klobuchar left office, where he was convicted again. But earlier this week, when he spoke to ABC News’ Lindsey Davis, he placed the blame squarely on Klobuchar:
Lindsey Davis : “Do you hold Amy Klobuchar responsible?”
Myon Burrell : “Yes. Personally, I feel like she is the source of everything that happened, with her charging me.”
In a statement to CNN on Monday night, Klobuchar reiterated her position on the case:
“This was about an 11-year-old girl, Tyesha Edwards, who was killed while she was sitting at her kitchen table doing her homework. And as a prosecutor, our job is to convict the guilty and protect the innocent,” Klobuchar said in the statement.
“So if any evidence was not put forward or was not appropriately investigated or if new evidence has emerged that should have been discovered at the time, it must be reviewed.”
AIPAC
The annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) conference is going to be missing at least a few people this year: Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, and former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Sanders has made his reason for not attending explicit, saying late last week: “I remain concerned about the platform AIPAC provides for leaders who express bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian rights.”
But the other candidates, including Klobuchar, have not made clear why they are not attending. The conference will be held on Super Tuesday, which has added several states this year, and attending would likely cut into their schedule.
By the numbers
* 700% : During the last Democratic debate, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg said he decreased “stop and frisk” by 95 percent. He actually increased it by 700 percent.
* $900,000 : The amount Kitchen Table Conversations, a Super PAC supporting Amy Klobuchar, just spent on television ads in South Carolina. That puts their total spending in South Carolina at $1,855,100.
* 2 : The number of days until the South Carolina primary.
The president next door
After the South Carolina primary comes what could be the final test for Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s campaign. Super Tuesday brings primary contests in 14 states, American Samoa and one for Americans abroad, making up around 40 percent of delegates. If polls hold, it will be nearly impossible for Klobuchar to make up the delegate difference needed for a majority or a plurality. Her best hope would then be a brokered convention.
One bright spot for her campaign: Things can change. The latest Minnesota poll of 500 likely voters, from MPR and the Star Tribune, is emphatically different from the last polls we’ve seen in the state. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has gone from leading the pack to third place and Minnesota’s home state senator has gone from second place to a slight edge over Sen. Bernie Sanders. Here are the results:
* Sen. Amy Klobuchar: 29%
* Sen. Bernie Sanders: 23%
* Sen. Elizabeth Warren: 11%
* Joe Biden: 8%
* Bloomberg: 3%
* Buttigieg: 3%
* Gabbard: 1%
* Steyer: 1%
* Undecided: 21%
Hanna Trudo at the Daily Beast points out that Sanders isn’t just looking to do well in Minnesota. He’s looking to win, and by doing so, to overcome Klobuchar’s home state advantage. The Vermont senator will hold a rally in St. Paul on Monday.
The Sanders campaign also just released a large list of 56 endorsements by Minnesotans, including union members, community leaders, and elected officials. Here’s the list of electeds (the rest are linked above):
* Hodan Hassan , State Representative (District 62A) & Assistant Majority Leader, Minneapolis, MN
* Carlos Mariani , State Representative (District 65B), St. Paul, MN
* Dai Thao , Councilmember (Ward 1), St. Paul, MN
* Nadia Mohamed , Councilwoman (At Large B), St. Louis Park, MN
* Rochelle (Shelly) Dahlquist , Council Member (Ward 1), Moorhead, MN
* Kim Ellison , Chair, Minneapolis Board of Education, Minneapolis, MN
* Marny Xiong , Chair, St. Paul Public School Board, St. Paul, MN
* Angie Hanson , Board Member and Clerk, Albert Lea Area Schools, Albert Lea, MN
* AK Hassan , Commissioner, Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board, Minneapolis, MN
* Chelsea Skog , Supervisor (District 3) & Secretary, Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation Board District, Eagan, MN
In other news
* ‘He Hasn’t Been Here’: Why Joe Biden Lags in Super Tuesday States
* The Minnesota House debated insulin affordability on Thursday. Per Sarah Mearhoff at Forum News, Republican state Rep. Jeremy Munson opposed Democrats’ insulin bill and asked: “Why diabetics? Why are diabetics getting their medicine for free? … Is it because diabetics have the best lobbying groups out there?”
* Transgender women are nearly always incarcerated with men. That’s putting many in danger.
Quote of the week
“What Amy Klobuchar is really saying when she talks about having ‘receipts?’” asks this MPR story.

Hunter Biden takes up painting after being 'addicted to crack for four years'

Texto completo: Fresh off years of drug addiction, a presidential impeachment saga that involved his work in Ukraine, and agreeing to pay child support to an Arkansas stripper he impregnated, Hunter Biden is pursuing a career in painting.
In a pool house-turned-art studio behind his 2,000-square-foot Hollywood Hills home, Biden, dressed in work boots and a pearl snap button-down shirt, is painting psychedelic florals in ink. The New York Times featured the son of former Vice President Joe Biden in a lengthy profile in which Hunter Biden said painting is "literally keeping me sane."
“For years, I wouldn’t call myself an artist. Now, I feel comfortable saying it," Biden said. “You have to be really focused in order to be able to alter it to your own imagination.”
Biden, who has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, has recently been involved in a paternity case. Biden has attempted to hide his financial records and delay the child support deposition until after key primary states in his father's run for the presidency are decided.
Biden's name was highlighted throughout President Trump's impeachment investigation after the president asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Joe and Hunter Biden's dealings in the country.
Biden said his new wife, 33-year-old Melissa Cohen, hates when he gets painting supplies on his clothes. "I always get my pants dirty,” Biden said. “I don’t even notice it, but Melissa hates it.” He got a tattoo of the word "shalom" on his left bicep the day after meeting Cohen, who lived in Israel for seven years.
“I was addicted to crack for four years,” he said. “I went through a really long period of addiction, and I was at a point where I didn’t read, write, think. I don’t do things halfway. That can be a problem.”
Biden, 50, is expecting a fifth child, this one with Cohen.
Biden has no formal training as a painter and has yet to land gallery representation, but he plans on exhibiting his work in the future. Collector Beth Rudin DeWoody, a former board member of the Whitney Museum in New York City, said she believes Biden can have a successful career in the art world due to his prominent last name.
Biden is not the first high-profile member of politics to turn to a career in painting. Former President George W. Bush has been hailed as a contemporary artist after his figurative paintings were revealed to the public following his two terms in the Oval Office.
Biden said painting allows him to put his energy toward a positive place and that his ink pieces are the "one thing they can’t take away from me."

A Bernie Sanders nomination is Nancy Pelosi's nightmare

Texto completo: As the race for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination intensifies, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to keep the peace.
Bernie Sanders’s recent gains have left establishment Democrats, Pelosi included, nervous. But when asked if she’d be comfortable with Sanders leading the Democratic ticket, Pelosi gave a one-word answer: “Yes.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has offered a similar response, arguing that any one of the Democratic candidates would help the party achieve its primary goal of beating President Trump.
But the Democratic Party is not as happy a family right now as such talk might suggest.
From 2006 to 2018, House and Senate Democrats had a formula for electoral success. Both Pelosi and Schumer were personally involved in making it happen. When they won — and they can be said to have "won" four of the last seven elections — Democrats did it by fielding appropriate candidates for states and districts that were out of the reach of more typical leftist Democrats.
This meant running many centrists who broke from party orthodoxy on one issue or another. It meant campaigning on popular and unifying issues, such as a ban on insurer discrimination against those with preexisting conditions. And finally, it meant not squeezing the party's candidates by nationalizing their elections around polarizing and extremist ideas. To give the obvious example, neither Schumer nor Pelosi would have ever wanted their party to rally around divisive ideological labels such as "socialist."
After her stunning victory in 2018, Pelosi seemed to be keeping her party on the right path, avoiding capitulation to the far Left. She resisted an ill-founded impeachment effort as long as she felt she could. She fought against attempts by the far-left "Squad" to usurp her speakership, even disparaging their "Green Dream, or whatever they call it." As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came to define the new class of Democrats, Pelosi repeatedly sought to downplay the freshman's influence, explaining that the 2018 campaign was won by dozens of more moderate Democrats running in swing districts on a more incremental approach to policy.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” she told the New York Times last July. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.” An irate Ocasio-Cortez would subsequently accuse the first female speaker of the House of being both racist and sexist.

But now, Ocasio-Cortez may be having the last laugh. Not only has Sanders emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, but the young Bronx socialist can claim part of the credit. Last October, when many were writing off Sanders in the wake of his heart attack, she endorsed him along with squadmates Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. That was one factor that helped revive Sanders and added fuel to his comeback.
Now, Pelosi faces the nomination of Sanders, an out-and-proud socialist who can hardly back away today from his repeated praise for Fidel Castro and other communist dictators. If she disowns him, she’ll fuel progressive angst over another establishment coup against Sanders that will "rob" him of the nomination. This would only encourage further bad behavior by the party's far-left members in Congress and a potential sit-out of the election by its most committed voters and activists on the Left.
But if Pelosi simply capitulates and accepts her party's new socialist overlords, the consequences for the entire party, up and down the ballot, could be catastrophic. In 2018, Pelosi placed an emphasis on popular issues such as protecting people with preexisting conditions — and portrayed Republicans as the ones who wanted to disrupt people's healthcare. This played a central role in the Democrats' ability to win over suburbs in the decisive districts. What happens to the party when its standard-bearer's goal is to take away the current health insurance of these same suburban voters and otherwise devour their wealth with confiscatory tax rates, so as to create new utopian schemes? Democrats could lose their House majority, which they won back in 2018 thanks in part to older, educated, well-off voters who tend to be more moderate than Pelosi herself — let alone the socialist wing of the party.
This isn't just about 2020 either. It's an ideological battle for the future of the Democratic Party. If Pelosi remains silent and Sanders wins the nomination, she will have lost that battle to Ocasio-Cortez and the other radicals.
As little as the Democratic Party's left wing wants to admit it, the party needs moderate voters to maintain and build its House majority, retake the Senate, and win the White House. Sanders thus poses a problem to which there is no easy solution. Whether Pelosi embraces him as the nominee or works against him, she will face negative political ramifications, just when her party needs most to stay united.

'Political interference': Jerry Nadler seeks testimony from John Durham about Russia inquiry review

Texto completo: House Democrats want U.S. Attorney John Durham to testify about his inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation.
Rep. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr on Friday requesting documents and interviews with 15 officials with knowledge of cases of personal interest to President Trump.
"The Judiciary Committee needs to examine a range of recent actions that smack of political interference, including the Department’s withdrawal of the Roger Stone sentencing recommendation; intervening in the handling of the Michael Flynn prosecution; overruling the decision to relocate Paul Manafort to Rikers Island; opening investigations into career officials involved in the Russia investigation; and a series of controversial interventions into sensitive antitrust matters," Nadler said in the four-page letter.
"Our democracy is founded on the notion that no one is above the law, and strict adherence to the rule of law has separated us from all other nations," the New York Democrat added. "Attorneys General have supported this principle on a bipartisan basis throughout our history, but that principle is now under assault. There is also a long history of Attorneys General cooperating in oversight inquiries led by both Democrats as well as Republicans, and given the stakes for our nation, we expect Attorney General Barr’s full cooperation here."
Durham, a top prosecutor in Connecticut, was on the list of officials. Nadler asked that Barr respond by March 13 "given the urgent and serious nature of these requests."
A spokesperson for Durham declined to comment and referred the Washington Examiner to the Justice Department's public affairs office. The DOJ did not immediately return a request for comment.
Trump gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the "investigation of the investigators" last year. Durham was assigned to review possible misconduct by federal law enforcement and intelligence officials during the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign by Barr, who said in the spring that "some of the facts" surrounding the inquiry "don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened." Following the DOJ watchdog’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act report, Barr said he told Durham to focus just as much on the FBI’s actions after Trump’s election in November 2016 as before it.
Democrats have criticized the review as a politically motivated scheme to undermine the work of former special counsel Robert Mueller and attack Trump's perceived enemies.
“I have faith that Durham is going to get to the bottom of this,” House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, a California Republican, said at CPAC on Friday. “I really do.”
In October, Fox News reported that Durham expanded the investigation, broadening his team to include additional agents and resources as the period of time they were examining expanded into 2017. Weeks later, it was revealed that Durham opened a criminal inquiry in his investigation, which gave the federal prosecutor the power to impanel a grand jury and hand down indictments. Former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinesmith, who is believed to have altered a key document in FISA filings related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, is the only person publicly known to be under criminal investigation by Durham.
Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Republican member of the House's judiciary and intelligence panels, told Fox News on Sunday that he believes Durham is "specifically" looking into alleged FISA abuses, noting the Justice Department already determined that at least two of the four FISA orders targeting Page were not valid.
Durham is reportedly reviewing former CIA Director John Brennan’s analysis of Russian election interference, including scrutiny of his handling of a secret source said to be close to the Kremlin. Some of the U.S. attorney's scrutiny revolves around how the U.S. government eventually reached its January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian election interference and whether Brennan was pushing for a biased result.
The prosecutor is also focused on at least two clashes over sensitive information, according to sources cited by the New York Times, including an internal Obama administration squabble related to restrictions placed upon yet-unknown foreign intelligence by an unnamed intelligence agency and a fight over the White House preventing the FBI from viewing U.S. emails hacked by the Russians but obtained, copied, and given to the United States by an unnamed foreign intelligence service.
Barr is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on March 31. He was called to testify by House Democrats, who seek answers about the Justice Department's conduct, including the scaled-back sentencing recommendation for longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and matters related to Russia and Ukraine.
Republicans have their own priorities. According to House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, the GOP side will focus on why the Justice Department dropped its criminal investigation into former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, as well as FISA reform following a scathing DOJ watchdog report. Collins told Sunday Morning Futures that he wants to hear more about Durham's progress and whether the prosecutor has "adequate resources" for his investigation.
“The Democrats’ request today is yet another attempt to distract from the job they’ve failed to do, which is reform FISA and finally address the abuse that has plagued our nation over the last three years," the Georgia Republican said in response to Nadler's letter. "The only political interference our committee should be examining is the FBI’s unlawful surveillance of Carter Page and the Trump campaign. The fact that Democrats sent these requests just two days after canceling our FISA markup and putting our national security at risk is further proof that they care about one thing and one thing only: Attempting to take down President Trump.”

Texto completo: Political commentator Mike Huckabee said Democrats and other critics of President Trump would blame him for fighting the COVID-19 virus no matter what he does.
The former Arkansas governor made his argument with a touch of humor by describing an imagined scenario in which Trump single-handedly removes the virus out of every person who has been infected by coronavirus.
"He could personally suck the virus out of every one of the 60,000 people in the world, and suck it out of their lungs, swim to the bottom of the ocean and spit it out, and he would be accused of pollution for messing up the ocean," Huckabee said Thursday on the Ingraham Angle on Fox News.
Trump has been criticized by Democrats and some pundits in the media for what they say was an inadequate response to the global outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.
There have been dozens of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States and tens of thousands more around the world. The World Health Organization deemed it a public health crisis, and Trump this week tapped Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. response effort.
"It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have, as I said, we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it," Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi panned Trump's request for $2.5 billion in funding to fight the virus. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is the front-runner in the 2020 Democratic primary race, called the Trump administration's handling of the outbreak "disgusting."
A New York Times opinion article published this week talked about there being a "Trumpvirus."
"Our president had to be going crazy over a problem that involves both declining stock prices and germs," columnist Gail Collins wrote. "This is the guy, after all, who thinks shaking hands is 'barbaric,' who is followed around by aides bearing sanitizer."
Huckabee is a frequent defender of Trump. His daughter, Sarah Sanders, was the president's press secretary for two years.

Intelligence community disputes 2020 Trump-Russia story embraced by Democrats

Texto completo: The U.S. intelligence community is disputing information the media were given about a classified House Intelligence Committee briefing earlier this month, with officials denying that lawmakers were told that Russia is attempting to help President Trump in 2020.
“We cannot comment on classified briefings, but what we can tell you is that Shelby did not say Russia is aiding the reelection of President Trump,” a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the Washington Examiner.
The controversial classified briefing took place Feb. 13 and was conducted in part by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community election threats executive under then-acting DNI Joseph Maguire. Officials from the FBI, CIA, and National Security Agency were also present. Sources cited by the New York Times last Thursday claimed Pierson warned that “Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump reelected.”
John Brennan, CIA director under President Barack Obama, immediately spread the narrative to his 766,000 followers, claiming “we are now in a full-blown national security crisis" and "Trump is abetting a Russian covert operation to keep him in office for Moscow’s interests.”

A senior intelligence official told CBS News on Monday that “this was an interagency briefing with precoordinated messages that had been briefed to other congressional committees.”

NBC News cited officials who said “the misinformation and controversy" made them "worried that the public is not getting a full appreciation of the threat of foreign election interference in 2020.” The reports were “an overstatement, fueled, they believe, by a misinterpretation by some Democratic lawmakers on the committee.”

That echoes denials by a national security official cited by CNN’s Jake Tapper last Friday.
“What's been articulated in the news is that the intelligence community has concluded that the Russians are trying to help Trump again. But the intelligence doesn't say that,” Tapper’s source said. “The problem is, Shelby said they developed a preference for Trump. A more reasonable interpretation of the intelligence is not that they have a preference; it's a step short of that.”
The official added, “It's more that they understand the president is someone they can work with; he's a deal maker. But not that they prefer him over” his Democratic opponents. “So it may have been mischaracterized by Shelby,” he said.
CNN reported an intelligence official said Pierson's characterization was “misleading,” while a national security official said she didn’t provide proper “nuance.”
The Washington Post cited a source who claimed the briefing “was the catalyst” that led Trump to replace Maguire with U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence. But national security adviser Robert O’Brien said Trump didn't make the personnel switch because of the briefing.
Still, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff embraced the hotly disputed framing of the reports. When the New York Times published it, Schiff tweeted: “We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true and the President is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling.”
Trump called it “another misinformation campaign.”
“Nobody briefed me about that at all,” Trump said. “They leaked it, Adam Schiff and his group.”
Schiff called this a “nice deflection.”
“Your false claims fool no one,” he tweeted. “You’ve betrayed America. Again.”
“I haven't seen any intelligence that Russia is doing anything to attempt to get President Trump reelected,” O’Brien said Sunday.
“He's at it again by putting out, through his committee, information that is false,” Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe said this weekend. “I don't know anyone in the last three years who has done more to help Vladimir Putin and Russia with their efforts to sow the seeds of discord in American elections and American election security than Adam Schiff has.”

“You have folks that have access to classified information that are not treating it with the respect that it deserves,” Ratcliffe told an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. “Why is it always the case when it’s information that’s allegedly damaging to Donald Trump? It’s a one-way street.”

Daniel Hoffman, the CIA’s former Moscow station chief, told the Washington Examiner that Putin "wants our candidates to be on the defensive and to have one side accuse the other of being subjected to Russian influence.”

Ross Douthat: The case for Joe Biden

Texto completo: The Democratic Party has an opportunity: Donald Trump’s chronic unpopularity, even in the midst of solid economic growth, means that 2020 is a once-in-a-generation chance to really go for it — to nominate the leftward-most candidate, reverse Ronald Reagan’s 1980s revolution and pull the whole political system decisively toward social democracy.
To nominate Joe Biden is to pass up that opportunity.
The Democratic Party has a choice: to root itself anew in working-class politics, trying to weld together the interests of younger Americans with downscale and service-sector voters, or to lean into its emerging identity as an upper-middle-class coalition, a party of progressivism and technocratic competence.
To nominate Joe Biden is to duck that choice.
This combination — plus, let’s be frank, Biden’s fumbling, wavering, I’m-too-old-for-this persona — explains why it’s so hard to find passionate supporters of the former vice president among pundits and commentators, real-world activists and Twitter agitators. To choose Biden over the more interesting options, over Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, is to choose the past over the future, sustainable decadence over dynamism and drama, the same old ineffective establishment over a more decisive break.
But Biden might still be the best choice for his party.
I’ve written favorably about Sanders’ capacity to unite Democrats and play a reverse-Reagan role — with the coronavirus, perhaps, as Trump’s Iran hostage crisis. But no one should doubt that Bernie’s ideological revolution is a gamble, and it remains an open question whether Sanders can pivot, as Reagan did, from revolution to reassurance once swing voters are in play.
For now Biden and Sanders both lead Trump consistently in polls, but Biden’s policies are considerably more popular, and if Sanders can claim that the polls prove socialism isn’t necessarily a liability, then Biden can say they prove the same of his age and his family’s buckraking. Candidates with more baggage than Biden have won the presidency (Trump himself being an example); a socialist promising the end of private health insurance has not.
Likewise, the different realignments that Sanders and Bloomberg and Warren seek all run the risk of realigning the Democrats right out of a majority. Root yourself in working-class politics and you might lose too many suburban women; become too fully upper-middle-class progressive and you might start to lose black and Hispanic men. The Sanders coalition relies on extremely optimistic projections about youth turnout; the Bloomberg coalition risks seeing suburban gains canceled out by rural and blue-collar losses. Nominating Biden won’t generate wild enthusiasm or infuse the party with Bloombergian billions, and enthusiasm and money matter — but so does having the broadest possible support.
So Biden remains the cautious, more-things-to-more-people choice, and if Democrats believe Trump to be an unprecedented authoritarian threat, then the case for such caution is self-evident. One might reasonably prefer a different cautious choice, an Amy Klobuchar or one of the failed-to-launch moderates — but Biden is the only one who appears viable, the only not-Sanders candidate who still has a clear-enough path to the nomination. And with Super Tuesday upon us, for cautious Democrats there may be no alternative.
The same case for the advantages of caution applies to what a Biden presidency might bring. He will not induce Mitch McConnell to pass “Medicare for All” or make college free, or perform the prestidigitation on the country’s regulatory system that Warren promises. But in a world with a Republican-controlled or 50-50 Senate, he is somewhat less likely than other candidates to see his agenda gridlocked from the start, more likely to successfully jawbone Joe Manchin on health care or Pat Toomey on guns, and perhaps modestly more likely to gain a Democratic majority in the Senate after 2022.
You lose any immediate chance at sweeping change, in other words, but you gain some room for incrementalism that greater ideological ambition might foreclose.
Finally, the strongest argument for Biden is nonideological: More than the other candidates, he offers the possibility of a calmer presidency, where politics fades a bit from the daily headlines, where the average American is less bombarded by social-media swarms and cable-news freakouts, where gridlock and polarization persist but their stakes feel modestly reduced.
I’ll be honest: It wouldn’t be good news for political columnists, but as a citizen it doesn’t sound that bad.

U.S. maintains pressure on Iran, stalling diplomacy while expecting attacks

Texto completo: Washington • The United States and Iran may have pulled back from the brink of war, but they have refused to stand down since the U.S. drone strike in January that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of Tehran’s elite Quds Force.
Instead, the two adversaries have needled each other with increasing pressure. The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions against Iran, while Tehran has flouted Washington’s warnings by shipping weapons to Shiite allies in the Middle East. Iranian-backed militias continue to attack bases in Iraq where Americans are deployed.
The stalemate could last for another year at least, officials and experts say. As Iran leaders grapple with a severe coronavirus outbreak and occasional protests, its leaders are signaling it will wait out the American presidential election in November to decide whether to open new nuclear negotiations with world powers. In the meantime, Congress wants to clip President Donald Trump’s authority to strike Iran.
With Secretary of State Mike Pompeo scheduled to brief the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday about the administration’s next steps, here is a look at where things stand.
The administration is sticking with ‘maximum pressure.’
Pompeo will be asked about the decision to kill Soleimani in a Jan. 3 strike in Baghdad after an Iranian-backed militia had protested at the U.S. Embassy. But Congress appeared unconvinced of the urgency of the strike: Both the House and Senate have since voted to restrain Trump’s war powers against Iran.
Over the past two months, the Trump administration has imposed more sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, metals, manufacturing and textile industries, as well as against some of the country’s military commanders, senior officials in its government and officials involved in its elections and nuclear program. On Wednesday, the State Department added the leader of the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq and Syria to its list of foreign terrorists.
[ Read more: What is Trump’s Iran strategy? Few seem to know. ]
The sanctions are the main tool being wielded by the Trump administration in its push for new limits to Tehran’s nuclear and military programs.
But the U.S. campaign could backfire if the sanctions so weaken Iran’s economy that its citizens become more dependent on the government for a lifeline, experts say.
“It’s been very effective in damaging Iran’s economy,” said Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “But you have to ask, ‘To what end?’”
Is it working?
Pompeo insists it is, but continuing violence exposes the challenges to the policy.
The strike on Soleimani “provided the Iranians with a deep knowledge that our notion of deterrence is real,” Pompeo said in Saudi Arabia last week.
Soleimani’s death was the climax of tit-for-tat violence that began Dec. 27, when a U.S. interpreter was killed and others wounded in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base carried out by militias supported by Iran. The Pentagon responded by bombing militia members in Iraq and Syria. That led to the riot outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Dec. 31.
Iran retaliated to Soleimani’s death by firing missiles at U.S. troops at two Iraqi military bases Jan. 8. Nobody was killed, but more than 100 troops have reported brain injuries.
Iranian-backed militias have since resumed attacks on the U.S. Embassy and Iraqi bases where U.S. troops are stationed. And Iran was caught this month shipping antiaircraft missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen.
One senior Iraqi official said the rocket attacks on compounds hosting Americans have become increasingly worrisome. Some rockets are landing closer to frequently-populated facilities, and Iraqi security forces have found nearby staging platforms equipped to launch up to 36 rockets at a time.
In recent months, Trump has deployed thousands of additional troops to the region.
Are U.S. allies on board?
European allies and other world powers have opposed the sanctions against Iran — particularly the oil embargo — while Arab Gulf States have supported them. But both sides are now united over worries that the U.S. pressure campaign will end any hope of negotiating a new nuclear agreement.
In Europe, officials do not believe the maximum pressure campaign has curbed Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
One European diplomat said many Europeans remain concerned that the Trump administration is pursuing regime change — even though U.S. officials insist that is not the goal. That diplomat added that, while the government in Tehran seemed shaken by the recent events, including the accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner and the protests that followed, it is not likely to fall.
Nor do diplomats expect Iran to step back from its support for proxy militias or halt covert attacks. Arab states have warned of widening violence in the region if Tehran feels pushed too hard by the United States.
Anti-U.S. sentiments in Iraq are already are on the rise, a U.S. official said. A Middle East diplomat also predicted that Iran will carry out more attacks — similar to those against key oil fields in Saudi Arabia or oil tankers around the Strait of Hormuz — to test the Trump administration.
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and an Iran hawk, has recognized that the Trump administration is offering nothing to entice Iran to come to the negotiating table. Graham has told people he is working on potential inducements for Washington to offer Tehran.
New nuclear negotiations are unlikely soon.
Two senior Middle Eastern officials who speak to the Trump administration regularly on Iran said they do not expect Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, to agree to start new negotiations with the United States soon. Instead, they said, he will wait to see the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in November before deciding on a new strategy.
Trump said he wants to strike a new deal with Iran that is more expansive than the 2015 nuclear treaty that the Obama administration brokered with world powers and Tehran — and from which Trump withdrew the United States in 2018. Trump administration officials say they are looking not only for tougher restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, but also for limits on its ballistic missile efforts and its support for regional militias.
Foreign diplomats said Pompeo wants future negotiations to include more parties — adding Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to the talks that were previously held among Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia, the United States and the European Union.
As a way around the U.S. sanctions, European officials have suggested creating a barter system to continue trade with Iran and, in turn, keep the 2015 nuclear deal alive, even though Iran has violated the boundaries of the agreement since Trump’s withdrawal from it. In January, Britain, France and Germany put Iran on notice that it would reimpose international sanctions if Tehran did not comply with the deal.
At a meeting Wednesday of the deal’s remaining signers, Iranian diplomats said they were eager to salvage the agreement.
Is it regime change or regime ‘disruption’?
Senior State Department officials have told foreign diplomats that Iran’s leaders are “finished,” and that Tehran is running out of money, according to Western officials.
Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s special representative on Iran, said Tehran is facing its “worst financial crisis and its worst political unrest in its 40-year history.”
Last week, Hook seized on rigged parliamentary elections in Iran as the latest opportunity to encourage domestic opposition, which flared last fall against the government.
However, “I don’t think we’re under any delusions that the regime will collapse tomorrow,” said Mark Dubowitz, chief executive of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank that consults closely with the Trump administration on Iran policy. “We think there will be continued instability inside Iran, because these protests will break out with greater potency and frequency.”
Last year, on “Intelligence Matters,” a podcast hosted by Michael J. Morrell, a former acting C.I.A. director, Pompeo defined the goal of the pressure campaign as creating conditions to turn the opinion of Iranians against their government.
“Essentially, he admitted their policy is regime change,” Morrell said.
U.S. intelligence officials who brief Congress have said that the Iranian government remains stable, even if under pressure.
“I think the administration, in candor, does not even have a strategy for what would replace the regime,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif. and a member of the House Armed Services Committee. He called the U.S. pressure campaign “purely punitive.”
And even if the 80-year-old Khamenei left power, diplomats and experts said, his replacement might be even less inclined to pursue diplomacy with the United States.
“The people have no say in the matter,” said Haleh Esfandiari, founding director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center. “Nor is the selection of a moderate cleric as successor likely.”

Texto completo: So, here’s the response of the Trump team and its allies to the coronavirus, at least so far: It’s actually good for America. Also, it’s a hoax perpetrated by the news media and the Democrats. Besides, it’s no big deal, and people should buy stocks. Anyway, we’ll get it all under control under the leadership of a man who doesn’t believe in science.
From the day Donald Trump was elected, some of us worried how his administration would deal with a crisis not of its own making. Remarkably, we’ve gone three years without finding out: Until now, every serious problem facing the Trump administration, from trade wars to confrontation with Iran, has been self-created. But the coronavirus is looking as if it might be the test we’ve been fearing.
And the results aren’t looking good.
The story of the Trump pandemic response actually began several years ago. Almost as soon as he took office, Trump began cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading in turn to an 80% cut in the resources the agency devotes to global disease outbreaks. Trump also shut down the entire global-health-security unit of the National Security Council.
Experts warned that these moves were exposing America to severe risks. “We’ll leave the field open to microbes,” declared Tom Frieden, a much-admired former head of the CDC, more than two years ago. But the Trump administration has a preconceived notion about where national security threats come from — basically, scary brown people — and is hostile to science in general. So we entered the current crisis in an already weakened condition.
And the microbes came.
The first reaction of the Trumpers was to see the coronavirus as a Chinese problem — and to see whatever is bad for China as being good for us. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, cheered it on as a development that would “accelerate the return of jobs to North America.”
The story changed once it became clear that the virus was spreading well beyond China. At that point it became a hoax perpetrated by the news media. Rush Limbaugh weighed in: “It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now, I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus. ... The coronavirus is the common cold, folks.”
Limbaugh was, you may not be surprised to hear, projecting. Back in 2014 right-wing politicians and media did indeed try to politically weaponize a disease outbreak, the Ebola virus, with Trump himself responsible for more than 100 tweets denouncing the Obama administration’s response (which was actually competent and effective).
And in case you’re wondering, no, the coronavirus isn’t like the common cold. In fact, early indications are that the virus may be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish Flu, which killed as many as 50 million people.
Financial markets evidently don’t agree that the virus is a hoax; by Thursday afternoon the Dow was off more than 3,000 points since last week. Falling markets appear to worry the administration more than the prospect of, you know, people dying. So Larry Kudlow, the administration’s top economist, made a point of declaring that the virus was “contained” — contradicting the CDC — and suggested that Americans buy stocks. The market continued to drop.
At that point, the administration appears to have finally realized that it might need to do something beyond insisting that things were great. But according to The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent and Paul Waldman, it initially proposed paying for a virus response by cutting aid to the poor — specifically, low-income heating subsidies. Cruelty in all things.
On Wednesday, Trump held a news conference on the virus, much of it devoted to incoherent jabs at Democrats and the media. He did, however, announce the leader of the government response to the threat. Instead of putting a health care professional in charge, however, he handed the job to Vice President Mike Pence, who has an interesting relationship with both health policy and science.
Early in his political career, Pence staked out a distinctive position on public health, declaring that smoking doesn’t kill people. He has also repeatedly insisted that evolution is just a theory. As governor of Indiana, he blocked a needle exchange program that could have prevented a significant HIV outbreak, calling for prayer instead.
And now, according to The New York Times, government scientists will need to get Pence’s approval before making public statements about the coronavirus.
So the Trumpian response to crisis is completely self-centered, entirely focused on making Trump look good rather than protecting America. If the facts don’t make Trump look good, he and his allies attack the messengers, blaming the news media and the Democrats — while trying to prevent scientists from keeping us informed. And in choosing people to deal with a real crisis, Trump prizes loyalty rather than competence.
Maybe Trump — and America — will be lucky, and this won’t be as bad as it might be. But anyone feeling confident right now isn’t paying attention.

Texto completo: If he wins the nomination, whether outright or at the Democratic Party convention this summer, Sen. Bernie Sanders will be the most left-wing politician ever nominated for president and the only self-described “socialist” to ever run on the ballot line for either of the two major parties.
Many Democrats, especially moderates, think this is a disaster in waiting. They look back to 1972, when a different left-wing senator, George McGovern of South Dakota, was crushed by Richard Nixon, losing his home state and 48 others. They see a winnable election against a vulnerable incumbent potentially squandered by a candidate with radical views. They think Sanders will not only give Trump a victory, but a decisive one.
This could happen, but it probably won’t. The persistent belief that Sanders is unelectable is unfounded. The evidence says he can win.
The first step to winning is unifying the party, and Sanders can do that. He has a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than any other candidate. A recent Monmouth University poll gives him a net rating of 53 points (72% favorable to 19% unfavorable) compared with 48 points for Elizabeth Warren and 38 points for former Vice President Joe Biden.
Quinnipiac shows a similar spread, as well as strong ratings from moderate and conservative Democrats. And the vast majority of Democrats, 93%, say they would back Sanders against Trump. As a point of comparison, 88% say the same for Pete Buttigieg.
Sanders also fares well against the president in preliminary matchups. He has led Trump in nearly every poll since the start of 2019 and does better than most other candidates in the crucial swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that delivered Trump the White House. Yes, head-to-head polls aren’t as reliable now as they’ll be in the summer, after the conventions, or in the fall, when the general election starts in earnest. But if, on the strength of the polls, you believe a candidate like Biden can beat Trump, then you should think the same of Sanders.
As for the fear that Sanders would be another McGovern? Hyperpolarization makes that highly unlikely. In today’s political environment, winning either party’s nomination gives you a high electoral floor. If Sanders does lose, he won’t lose big.
The easiest objection to all of this is that Sanders has never been scrutinized like a presidential nominee. What will voters think when they learn he’s a socialist, “democratic” or otherwise? How will they react to footage of Sanders praising Cuba or singing “This Land Is Your Land” while on a honeymoon in the Soviet Union? Sanders has strong personal appeal, but can it survive an onslaught of Republican attacks? Will voters punish him for flying too far from the mainstream?
Again, it’s possible. But it’s also true that the mainstream isn’t as conservative as many believe. Lots of progressive ideas are popular with the public, sometimes incredibly so. And while voters are skeptical of the most expansive proposals, they aren’t reflexively hostile.
There’s something else to consider. In a world where Democrats as moderate as Bill Clinton have been accused of “socialism,” the word has simply lost its punch. Republicans can say it and voters will hear it, but they may not care.
At the end of the day, Sanders is the only candidate who can plausibly unite the anti-Trump majority of the electorate. He’s as popular with people who dislike partisan politics as he is with rank-and-file Democrats. With his forceful attacks on corruption and bigotry, he can speak directly to the concerns about Trump’s character and personality that have alienated moderate suburban whites and helped give Democrats the House of Representatives.
His “independent” persona might alienate people in the Democratic establishment, but it’s a powerful asset for the general election. It makes him a different kind of Democrat, removed from Washington in a way that appeals to much of the public.
That is why Sanders is uniquely electable. Despite his age, he promises a true break with the past.

Texto completo: On Tuesday night, after the latest Democratic debate, Ann Coulter tweeted, “Sen. Warren has convinced me that Bernie isn’t that worrisome. He’ll never get anything done. SHE’S the freak who will show up with 17 idiotic plans every day and keep everyone up until it gets done.” Vicious reactionary that she is, Coulter cut to the heart of Elizabeth Warren’s promise.
Warren has an almost supernatural ability to identify problems before anyone else, and to work relentlessly to solve them. Of all the Democratic candidates, she would make the most effective president. (Full disclosure: My husband, a graphic designer and creative director, works as a consultant for her.)
In 2007, Warren, then a Harvard law professor, wrote an article in the journal Democracy calling for the creation of what she called a Financial Product Safety Commission. “It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote. “But it is possible to finance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.” This was before a cascade of mortgage failures set off the financial crisis, which she foresaw.
Warren realized that complexity was being weaponized against consumers, pointing out that a typical credit card contract had grown from one page in the 1980s to more than 30 pages two decades later. Ordinary people didn’t have the bandwidth to understand the terms they were agreeing to, allowing lenders to fleece them.
Four years later her brainchild, now called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was a reality. It’s no small thing for someone who had little direct government experience to single-handedly spearhead the creation of a new agency. The CFPB has since provided $12.4 billion in relief to 31 million consumers.
I was one of them. As I’ve written before, I turned to the CFPB after discovering that my bank had enrolled me, without my knowledge, in a dubious program that purported to protect users’ credit. The bank had been fined $700 million in connection with it, but that didn’t get me my money back. So I went to the CFPB website, where I filled out a simple form. A few weeks later, my bank notified me that I was being refunded more than $11,000.
That experience is part of why my husband signed up to consult with Warren. (To design her logo, he went to the Statue of Liberty to find the precise color of green.)
What amazed me about the CFPB was its seamlessness. As Will Wilkinson has written, Warren’s agenda, with its blizzard of plans and calls for “big structural change,” has been painted as “contentiously ideological and bureaucratically suffocating.” This perception is upside down. Warren’s genius is using the regulatory process to make it simple for ordinary people to stand up to financial behemoths. She knows how excessive bureaucracy can be a tool of domination, and how to defend people from it.
Even if a Democrat wins the presidency in November, Democrats won’t be able to pass significant legislation unless they both take the Senate and eliminate the filibuster. That will make Warren’s mastery of the levers of executive power particularly important. As a senator, she was known for zeroing in on seemingly obscure appointments, understanding how, say, having the wrong person as an undersecretary for domestic finance could translate into real-world suffering. She has plans to use executive action to address problems like student loan debt and prescription drug prices.
Warren also has the most inspirational personal story of any of the contenders. The daughter of a maintenance man, she dropped out of college to get married, then returned to school to become a special ed teacher. When she lost her job after getting pregnant, she went to law school and soared to the top of her field. Many candidates would present such an extraordinary rise as evidence of unique personal grit, but Warren sees it as a parable about how good government policy can enable social mobility.
Unlike Bernie Sanders, she doesn’t carry the electoral albatross of socialism; she wants to purify capitalism of stifling corruption so it works as it should. Not for nothing is her dog, Bailey, named after the virtuous small-town banker played by Jimmy Stewart in “It’s a Wonderful Life.”
Under Trump, U.S. government has become a squalid orgy of self-dealing. There is not a person on earth better suited to clean it up than Warren. If this were a Jimmy Stewart movie, she’d come from behind to win the nomination. Right now that possibility looks remote, but as long as she’s still in the race and most of America hasn’t voted, it’s not too late for the nightmare of the Trump era to give way to a Hollywood ending.

Texto completo: So, our Coronavirus Czar is going to be … Mike Pence. Feeling more secure?
“I know full well the importance of presidential leadership,” the vice president said as soon as he was introduced in his new role.
Totally qualified. First criteria for every job in this administration is capacity for praising the gloriousness of our commander in chief.
Yeah, when you think of Mike Pence you maybe don’t think about Pandemic Fighter Supreme. But as President Donald Trump pointed out repeatedly, he has already run Indiana.
Well, it probably could have been worse. Having a czar does make you feel there’s somebody in charge. At least Trump didn’t come before the cameras and announce solemnly, “Today I’m asking every American to cross your fingers.”
Our president had to be going crazy over a problem that involves both declining stock prices and germs. This is the guy, after all, who thinks shaking hands is “barbaric,” who is followed around by aides bearing sanitizer. During his news conference he told the story of a fever-ridden supporter who gave him a hug. Do you think it was an apocryphal fantasy? Either way, the idea has been haunting him forever.
Meanwhile, he’s come up with a totally new explanation for the stock market skid. It turns out investors were not frightened so much by the pandemic as the Democratic debate.
“I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democratic candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,” Trump told reporters.
Plus that virus thing is … not necessarily a big deal. What really “shocked” him, Trump said, was his discovery that “the flu in our country kills 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.”
So the problems are the Democrats and the flu. The answers are Mike Pence and … reminding the public once again that Nancy Pelosi’s district has a big homeless problem.
Earlier in the day Trump argued, via tweet, that despite the expressions of concern by the evil media and “incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades,” the government is perfectly prepared to handle the coronavirus. Which he misspelled “caronavirus.” But nobody’s perfect.
The president had been saying everything is totally under control for some time. (“It’s one person coming in from China.”) The whole administration picked up the cry. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, 82, overcame his habit of dozing off at meetings long enough to tell Fox Business Network that the disease would “accelerate the return of jobs” from overseas.
Trump totally agrees. “What it’s going to do is keep people home, and they’re going to travel to places we have,” he said.
See? The virus thing is a bonus.
The runup to the Pence unveiling had not been exactly calming for citizens who wanted to have faith in competent White House oversight. Barack Obama used to have special epidemic-watching groups just in case this kind of crisis developed. One was headed by the highly regarded Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who got sent packing by John Bolton. Another infectious disease expert, Tom Bossert, suddenly vanished from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018, presumably also at the hand of John You-know-who.
If Bolton’s memoir ever makes it into print, do you think it’ll have a chapter called “My War on Pandemic Fighters?” OK, probably not.
Virus Week hasn’t really provided a whole lot of comfort to citizens who wanted to believe the president’s replacements were super high quality.
The nation got its first real look at Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, who appeared before a Senate subcommittee and admitted he had no idea how the virus was transmitted among humans, exactly how dangerous it was, or … pretty much anything.
When Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is not known for anti-administration bias, asked whether the country had enough respirators to deal with a coronavirus epidemic, Wolf answered in the affirmative.
“We just heard testimony that we don’t,” Kennedy responded.
“OK,” said Wolf.
To be fair, he’s only been on the job since November. He’s the fifth head of Homeland Security Trump’s had in the last three years. Good thing he has a deputy — or at least an acting deputy — to help. That would be Ken Cuccinelli, who made news this week when he went on Twitter to ask for tips on how to find an online map of coronavirus sites posted by Johns Hopkins University. (“Here’s hoping it goes back up soon.”)
Losing faith in presidential appointees for health protection? Stop being so negative. They’re all vetted by the Presidential Personnel Office, which is now headed by John McEntee, 29, who was previously fired from another White House job because of concerns about a history of gambling problems and tax issues.
McEntee will be getting plenty of help from other stellar appointees, the newest being a 23-year-old college undergraduate. Together they’re going to be cleaning house, getting rid of folks who are insufficiently loyal to the president. Or maybe aren’t qualified or something. Never can tell.
Also part of the new coronavirus response team is Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services — a veteran Cabinet member and experienced former pharmaceutical lobbyist.
At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Azar was asked if he’d consider using some of the billions of dollars in funds for Trump’s border wall to help combat the current health crisis.
Azar just chuckled. Actually, people, this is probably not a theme we ought to be pursuing. Chances are, if the president is encouraged to mix the subjects of coronavirus and Mexico walls, he’ll suddenly announce that we need a barrier much bigger and thicker and more expensive, so it can stop the flow of immigrant germs.

Texto completo: Since President Donald Trump took office, Democrats have been having a passionate debate about what matters more: increasing progressive turnout or winning over swing voters. And there is no doubt that both tactics help Democrats win elections. But the evidence about which tactic matters more is pretty overwhelming. Persuasion does.
Take one stark pattern: In the 2018 midterms, many Democratic candidates who ran persuasion campaigns flipped areas that had gone for Trump in 2016. Not a single Democrat won a competitive state or House district with an unabashedly progressive campaign.
Yet the presidential field is dominated by candidates who haven’t had to worry about persuading swing voters in years, if ever. Delaware (Joe Biden’s home), Massachusetts (Elizabeth Warren’s) and Vermont (Bernie Sanders’) all voted against Trump by large margins. Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg were each the mayor of an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
The best case for Amy Klobuchar is that she’s the only remaining candidate with a track record of winning over the kind of voters that the Democrats will need to beat Trump. She has built her career on a middle-class image that avoids the leftism of Sanders or Warren and the elitism of Buttigieg or Bloomberg. As for Biden, Klobuchar looks sharper than he does — and she has a much more impressive electoral history.
She won all three of her Senate campaigns in Minnesota by more than 20 percentage points. Trump, by comparison, lost the state by only 1.5 points in 2016. Klobuchar did it by winning suburbs that normally lean right and holding her own in many rural areas.
Her strategy isn’t exactly a secret. It is the same one that many congressional Democrats used in 2018, and not so different from Barack Obama’s approach to his 2012 reelection. She emphasizes the pocketbook issues on which Democrats hold a huge advantage over Republicans. She doesn’t make voters anxious by promising utopian dreams, like a mandatory version of Medicare that would ban private insurance. She promises to reduce the cost of medical care — and points out that Republicans will raise those costs.
Klobuchar also finds ways to demonstrate her respect to voters who disagree with her on many issues. She describes Minnesota as “a proud hunting state” and visits each of its 87 counties every year. She doesn’t take unpopular positions on immigration, like border decriminalization.
And yet Klobuchar is hardly a centrist. She wants to raise taxes on the rich, break up monopolies, vastly expand Medicare, fight climate change, admit more refugees, allow immigrants in the country illegally to become citizens, ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. A Klobuchar administration would probably be well to the left of the Obama administration.
Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president, has long said that he is conservative but not angry about it. Klobuchar is progressive without being angry about it. The combination can allow a politician to win the middle without being of that middle.
At this stage, of course, Klobuchar is unlikely to be the nominee. She hasn’t quite figured out how to adapt her approach for the scale of a presidential race. Too often, she still seems to be running for Senate, talking about committee assignments and legislative co-sponsors instead of telling a story about the country.
Still, Democrats would be wise to remember that her success in Minnesota is no mystery. It is the main way Democrats have won elections over the past decade, and it’s a strategy that any Democratic nominee, even Sanders, can mimic:
Pound away at simple economic issues — on which the country’s voters are legitimately progressive. Deemphasize cultural issues — on which voters are much more divided. And don’t give in to fantasies involving millions of left-wing nonvoters who are just waiting to show up at the polls.

Texto completo: In different circles at different points over the past year, it has been fashionable to hate Pete Buttigieg: He’s too clearly full of himself. He’s too far ahead of himself. What business does the 38-year-old former mayor of a relatively small city have running for president? What real claim to the job?
How about this: He has drawn closer to it than prominent senators who came out of the gate with much more heat on them and were gone even before Iowans caucused. He outpaced and outlasted seasoned governors whose popularity across a broad section of the political spectrum was supposed to be electoral magic. Before hitting a snag in Nevada, he had more delegates from Iowa and New Hampshire than any of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, including Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who began building their political bases and growing their political careers before Buttigieg was born. His surname is a nearly impenetrable thicket of consonants (BOOT-edge-edge), and yet tens of millions of Americans can now pronounce it just fine.
You cannot chalk that up to novelty. You cannot call it a fluke. It’s a powerful testament to his knacks for fashioning a message that resonates with Americans, delivering it clearly, avoiding unnecessary trouble and mobilizing support. Those talents are precisely the ones that the person sitting at the Resolute Desk needs most. Buttigieg’s campaign is his credential, and it’s a compelling one.
Undertaking a bid for the White House at his age indeed suggests hubris. But getting this far reflects a phenomenal work ethic, a stubborn optimism, extraordinary intelligence and preternatural poise. Those traits, too, are ideal for a president, and none of his rivals possess them in greater measure.
I do wish that he had more miles on his odometer. The way you manage the curves in the road ahead is to draw on the lessons of the hairpin turns before. I’m also concerned about his apparent blind spots on race, but I appreciate his refreshing acknowledgment of missteps. He means to be better. And the thing about students determined to get straight A’s is that they do the homework necessary to make the honor roll.
Buttigieg understands the greatest problem that America faces, which isn’t income inequality, racial injustice, climate change or an obsolete infrastructure. It’s fragmentation. That makes progress on all of those other fronts impossible. America is too divided to move forward. Americans dwell on too many islands with too much fury in the air and too few bridges between them. Buttigieg has not only talked about that more frequently and eloquently than many of the other Democrats in the race, he has made life choices that push against it.
He signed up for military service after he went door-to-door for Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and observed the wildly disproportionate representation of some American communities in the armed forces, which don’t exactly teem with Harvard-educated wunderkinds like him. To work in government, he didn’t head to Washington. He planted himself and deepened his roots in South Bend, Indiana, the frumpy Rust Belt city in which he’d grown up.
His detractors look at those lines on his résumé and see the eerily perfect machinations of an upstart who scribbled drafts of his inauguration address in crayons when he was still in diapers. Maybe. But, out of diapers, he put in time in places where similarly privileged young men and women typically don’t.
Buttigieg, who is married to another man, has also taken gorgeous aim at tribalism and prejudice. Last year, addressing Mike Pence’s creed-driven homophobia, he said: “Your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.” More recently, he questioned many conservatives’ invocation of “family values” by comparing his commitment to his husband with President Donald Trump’s payment of hush money to a porn star.
In those words I heard more than pithy sound bites. I heard a declaration that Americans can’t and shouldn’t tuck one another into categories. I heard his own claim to transcend any single identity: to be many identities at once. That’s the very definition of this country. With uncommon grace, Pete Buttigieg embodies it.

Texto completo: Few people on earth are so exploited as children trafficked into the sex trade. And now they are being exploited again, by President Donald Trump.
“My administration is putting unprecedented pressure on traffickers at home and abroad,” Trump declared at a White House meeting on trafficking last month. “My administration is fighting these monsters, persecuting and prosecuting them, and locking them away for a very, very long time. We’ve had a tremendous track record — the best track record in a long time.”
I’ve been reporting about human trafficking all over the world since the 1990s, so part of me is thrilled that a president is highlighting this issue. Ivanka Trump has made it a signature issue, and she organized the White House event. The president used the occasion to announce a new White House position to oversee anti-trafficking efforts, and all this high-level attention could be very helpful.
Yet it’s increasingly clear that this is less about protecting children and more about exalting Trump, whose administration is actually prosecuting fewer traffickers and making it harder for some trafficking survivors to get help. As a result, major anti-trafficking organizations boycotted the White House session.
“Over the last three years we have watched with horror as the administration has dismantled protections for trafficking survivors,” said Martina Vandenberg, the president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center in Washington, who stayed away.
“Using human trafficking for pernicious political purposes is new,” she added. “It is a Trump administration invention.”
The Human Trafficking Legal Center reports only 146 federal trafficking indictments in 2019, down from 204 in the last year of the Obama administration.
A whistleblower complaint alleges the administration diverted anti-trafficking money from well-respected nonprofits to less-effective organizations like “Hookers for Jesus.”
Foreign women and children who have been trafficked into America’s sex trade are eligible for a special visa, the T visa, under a program with bipartisan support, but the administration in 2019 approved only 500 T visas, down from 748 in 2016, and wait times are now three or four times longer. The administration now threatens to deport trafficking survivors who are denied T visas, so applications have fallen.
The U.S. traditionally pushed other countries to crack down on human traffickers and toughen their laws on trafficking. But in 2018, only five countries changed their laws, down from 25 in 2016. Many more tough laws are still needed.
The administration has also made no attempt to address underlying causes of trafficking — such as child poverty. America’s foster care system, for example, is dysfunctional and amounts to a pipeline for traffickers. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine last year offered an important road map to cut American child poverty by half — a step that would reduce trafficking — but the administration has ignored it.
“We are losing the ‘war on trafficking,’ mostly because we have made this all about prosecutions,” Vandenberg said. “We are doing almost no prevention.”
Rachel Lloyd, who was trafficked into the sex trade as a teenager, now runs an excellent program in New York City called the Girls Educational and Mentoring Service, or GEMS, which helps girls who have been trafficked. Lloyd said that when she realized that the administration was only engaged in a PR effort, she turned down a position on an administration advisory panel and also declined a $10,000 donation from Ivanka Trump for GEMS.
“Why would we give them cover and validation?” asked Lloyd, whose memoir, “Girls Like Us,” is one of the best books on trafficking.
Human trafficking is one of the preeminent moral challenges of our time. The International Labor Organization estimates that worldwide, some 10 million children exist in forms of modern slavery. In Cambodia, I once saw terrified young girls being sold for their virginity; in Pakistan, I saw a brothel owner determined to kill a girl who had escaped.
Trump’s exploitation of trafficking victims for his own purposes is particularly sad because this is a rare issue where Democrats and Republicans have worked productively together: Evangelical Christians and liberal feminists both have done heroic work for 20 years. Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, has done outstanding work on this issue, as has Gloria Steinem.
It’s useful for a president to speak up about trafficking, to keep the issue on the agenda. But Trump sensationalizes in lurid terms: “Women are tied up, they’re bound, duct tape put around their faces,” he has said. It’s usually more complicated than that, and survivors are irritated that Trump cites trafficking as a reason to build his border wall.
“This is an issue that doesn’t need overdramatizing,” said Lloyd, who was nearly killed by her pimp. “It’s bad enough. You don’t need to make it worse.”
Shaquana Blount, who was trafficked at age 14 in New York and is now 30, put it this way: “The president’s sensationalization of sex trafficking is a spit in the face to myself and many survivors, as his narrative does not fit ours. It is his own.”

David Brooks: The case for Mike Bloomberg

Texto completo: The best case for Mike Bloomberg is that he’s a brilliant debater who has a witty riposte for every line of attack.
OK. Let me start over. The best case for Mike Bloomberg is that he is not a brilliant debater. He can’t whip a rally crowd into an ideological frenzy. The best case for Bloomberg is that we’ve already elected a reality TV star to the White House. We need somebody who can actually run things.
We need somebody who can actually lead a government, staff an administration with talented professionals and do the mundane but essential tasks of pushing legislation and executing laws. We need somebody who will turn down the ideological temperature, so we don’t rip ourselves apart as a nation. We have enough politicians who cater to people who treat politics as the place they go to get self-indulgent moral affirmation baths. We need someone who can improve the lives of actual Americans.
Bloomberg was one of the most successful mayors of this century. He was a Republican who left office with two-thirds of New Yorkers saying he made their city a better place.
I’m not endorsing Bloomberg. I think it’s a mistake for journalists, even opinion journalists, to endorse, and I’d be fine with many of the candidates. But I just want to throw Bloomberg’s record before you:
Education : As mayor, Bloomberg took over a dysfunctional school system and instituted a series of fantastically successful reforms. When he became mayor, less than half of New York City students were graduating from high school on time. When he left, nearly two-thirds did so within four years. He replaced large failing schools with small attentive schools. The graduation rates in those places surged from 38% to 68%. Under Bloomberg test scores rose more quickly than in other cities. The black-white achievement gap decreased by 23%.
Job creation : Bloomberg inherited a city reeling from the 9/11 attacks and helped kick-start an economic boom. He inherited a city that was economically over-reliant on Wall Street and had a relatively tiny tech sector. Now New York receives the second highest amount of tech investment, after Silicon Valley. He led the effort to create an applied sciences university on Roosevelt Island that will supply the city with talent for generations. Private sector jobs increased by 10% during the last four years of his term alone. The mayor’s office said that 29,000 people found jobs through the city’s career centers in 2012, compared to 500 people in 2004.
Housing : Bloomberg rezoned about 40% of New York City and helped spark a neighborhood renaissance along just about every waterway in the city. He led a $2.4 billion expansion of the subway system to serve the new Hudson Yards neighborhood. He managed to finance 170,000 new affordable housing units, even while the state and federal governments slashed housing budgets.
Health and the environment : He banned artificial trans fats and smoking from bars and restaurants. New York experienced about a 30% decline in adult smoking over his tenure. Meanwhile his administration added more than 850 acres of parkland, reduced greenhouse-gas emissions in city-owned buildings, and created a bike-share program. Life expectancy in New York is now 81.2 years, more than two years longer than the national average.
Crime : Stop-and-frisk is obviously a blot on Bloomberg’s record. His focus on crime data made him blind to the human beings who were mistreated by his policies. And yet during his tenure homicide rates dropped by 65% and shootings dropped by 55%. In Bloomberg’s final year there were only 335 murders in New York, comparable to the 1950s.
Budgets : He raised property taxes on the most affluent citizens and used the money to boost city services. When he entered office the city budget was $42 billion. When he left it was about $70 billion.
The case against Bloomberg is that he’s said insensitive stuff and he didn’t succeed in making New York more equal. The case for him is that he led an immense amount of change that made life better overall. You decide. Does America need more gridlock and ideological fireworks or a practical manager who gets stuff done?

Texto completo: An attorney for Greg Ramey, a former child psychologist at Dayton Children’s Hospital facing child pornography charges, say the images on his computer were “provocative” but not obscene or illegal.
The defense attorney also said Ramey was targeted because of his high public profile.
Ramey pleaded not guilty Friday in Greene County Common Pleas Court to a 145-county indictment filed Thursday. His bond was set at $500,000, and his attorney Jon Paul Rion said he expects his client to post bond and be free while awaiting trial. Ramey’s trial is scheduled for May 18.

Ramey in court
Ramey appeared via video from the Greene County Jail for Friday’s arraignment. He wore inmate scrubs and said nothing other than answering yes or no questions from Magistrate Margaret Young.
Rion said before the arraignment, “We can tell you that the images are not even close to what the general public would think would be associated in a case like this.”
He said the images were of minors of both sexes and various ages. He said they depicted no sex acts and many were similar to what you would find in a family photo album or even some PG-rated movies.
“Every single individual in these images is clothed,” he said. “It’s far more benign than someone would expect to see in a case like this.”
Rion said he believes Ramey is being targeted because of his high profile in the community.
“I would assert that if Dr. Ramey served in a very non-public position, that I would have a serious question as to whether or not any of these charges would ever have been brought,” Rion said. “It’s my sense that there is a concern because of the position he held in the community that he is being held to a higher standard.”
Asked about Rion’s statements, a spokesman for the Ohio Attorney General’s Office said: “The grand jury was presented with the facts of the case and the indictment speaks for itself.”
The indictment alleges that between Jan. 1, 2012, and July 29, 2019, Ramey photographed or transferred photos of a minor “in a state of nudity,” and bought or possessed “obscene material” involving a minor. From July 1, 2019, to Aug. 8, 2019, Ramey knew of the investigation and tried to alter, destroy or hide evidence, the indictment alleges.
An indictment is an accusation that prosecutors must prove in court.
Ramey was identified as the source of electronic downloads of child pornography and Ramey’s activity was reported to the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, according to the attorney general’s office.
Rion said Ramey did not produce any of the images. He wouldn’t say why Ramey had them but said it had nothing to do with his work.
Ramey started at Dayton Children’s in 1979 and was dismissed in August. The pediatric psychologist was one of the public faces of Dayton Children’s, writing a weekly parenting column in the Dayton Daily News that was distributed on the New York Times wire service, and making frequent appearances in local and outside media.
He was also with the Wright State Department of Pediatrics as division chief for pediatric psychology.
“Dr. Ramey has given a lot of years of service to this community and I know the attorney general’s office is turning that against him in this case, but the fact of the matter is he served nobly and loyally to the Dayton community,” Rion said. “None of these allegations involve anything related to work whatsoever and so all the great work he did for the community, in my mind, is left untarnished.”
Ramey’s work included serving on the steering committee at Michael’s House, a Fairborn nonprofit that serves child victims, including victims of sex crimes. Ramey served in an advisory role and had no contact with children, according to Greene County Prosecutor Stephen Haller, who also serves on the steering committee.
Haller said he referred the case to the state when his office learned about it about six months ago because they both served on that board.
“After working with Dr. Ramey and knowing him in his professional capacity, when we first got the tip, I was shocked,” he said.
Bob Stinson, a forensic psychologist and attorney in Columbus, said it’s common for people to be shocked when they learn that someone they know is associated with deviant sexual behavior. “These individuals look just like everybody else. These individuals, unfortunately, they’re in our families, our schools, churches, sports recreation leagues,” Stinson said.
“Perpetrators don’t carry around a sign … It’s a very secretive behavior,” he said.

Acusan a psicólogo columnista del New York Times de 145 cargos de pornografía infantil en Ohio

Texto completo: Dr. Gregory Ramey, quien por muchos años ejerció como psicólogo infantil en Dayton (Ohio) y era columnista sindicado de temas pediátricos, ha sido acusado de 145 delitos relacionados con pornografía infantil.
Ramey (70) fue acusado el jueves de los cargos y se entregó a la cárcel del condado Greene.
El conocido psicólogo pediátrico fue uno de los rostros públicos de Dayton Children’s Hospital, escribiendo una columna semanal para padres en el Dayton Daily News que se distribuyó en el servicio de cable del New York Times, y haciendo apariciones frecuentes en medios de comunicación.
“Este abuso atroz de la confianza de los pacientes, por no hablar de la confianza del público, por parte de un médico, es terriblemente horrible”, dijo el fiscal general de Ohio, Dave Yost. “Los niños pequeños son inocentes, dulces y confiados: son frágiles y necesitan protección especial”.
Ramey fue identificado como fuente de descargas electrónicas de pornografía infantil , según la Oficina del Fiscal General de Ohio. Se dice que los crímenes ocurrieron entre enero de 2012 y julio de 2019.
Si es declarado culpable, podría ser encarcelado por el resto de su vida
“Ciertamente tenemos todo lo que necesitamos para esta acusación y eso debería ser suficiente para asegurarnos de que se mantenga alejado por un buen tiempo”, dijo Yost a ABC News.
La acusación cubre 90 imágenes que representan a 40 niños menores de 10 años, ninguno de los cuales era su paciente, detalló Yost.
Cuando el empleador de Ramey, el Hospital de Niños de Dayton, fue informado de la investigación, lo colocó inmediatamente en licencia administrativa y luego lo despidió.
Ese hospital, donde trabajó desde 1979, emitió un comunicado el jueves luego de la acusación de Ramey.
“En su papel profesional, el Dr. Ramey fue un defensor del bienestar mental de los niños y un orador frecuente en temas de peligro y explotación infantil (…) Por lo tanto, nos sorprendieron las acusaciones de comportamiento inapropiado en su vida personal. Nada en el desempeño de su rol profesional creó sospechas. Estamos conmocionados y profundamente preocupados por estas acusaciones, que están en marcado contraste con nuestra misión y valores fundamentales”.
La licencia de Ramey para practicar psicología en Ohio todavía está activa, pero ello podría cambiar.
“Somos conscientes de la acusación y su encarcelamiento, y estamos identificando las opciones disponibles en estas circunstancias”, dijo el Director Ejecutivo de la Junta de Psicología de Ohio, Ronald Ross.

Texto completo: The Democratic Party has an opportunity: Donald Trump’s chronic unpopularity, even in the midst of solid economic growth, means that 2020 is a once-in-a-generation chance to really go for it — to nominate the leftward-most candidate, reverse Ronald Reagan’s 1980s revolution and pull the whole political system decisively toward social democracy.
To nominate Joe Biden is to pass up that opportunity.
The Democratic Party has a choice: to root itself anew in working-class politics, trying to weld together the interests of younger Americans with downscale and service-sector voters, or to lean into its emerging identity as an upper-middle-class coalition, a party of progressivism and technocratic competence.
To nominate Joe Biden is to duck that choice.
This combination — plus, let’s be frank, Biden’s fumbling, wavering, I’m-too-old-for-this persona — explains why it’s so hard to find passionate supporters of the former vice president among pundits and commentators, real-world activists and Twitter agitators. To choose Biden over the more interesting options, over Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, is to choose the past over the future, sustainable decadence over dynamism and drama, the same old ineffective establishment over a more decisive break.
But Biden might still be the best choice for his party.
I’ve written favorably about Sanders’ capacity to unite Democrats and play a reverse-Reagan role — with the coronavirus, perhaps, as Trump’s Iran hostage crisis. But no one should doubt that Bernie’s ideological revolution is a gamble, and it remains an open question whether Sanders can pivot, as Reagan did, from revolution to reassurance once swing voters are in play.
For now Biden and Sanders both lead Trump consistently in polls, but Biden’s policies are considerably more popular, and if Sanders can claim that the polls prove socialism isn’t necessarily a liability, then Biden can say they prove the same of his age and his family’s buckraking. Candidates with more baggage than Biden have won the presidency (Trump himself being an example); a socialist promising the end of private health insurance has not.
Likewise, the different realignments that Sanders and Bloomberg and Warren seek all run the risk of realigning the Democrats right out of a majority. Root yourself in working-class politics and you might lose too many suburban women; become too fully upper-middle-class progressive and you might start to lose black and Hispanic men. The Sanders coalition relies on extremely optimistic projections about youth turnout; the Bloomberg coalition risks seeing suburban gains canceled out by rural and blue-collar losses. Nominating Biden won’t generate wild enthusiasm or infuse the party with Bloombergian billions, and enthusiasm and money matter — but so does having the broadest possible support.
So Biden remains the cautious, more-things-to-more-people choice, and if Democrats believe Trump to be an unprecedented authoritarian threat, then the case for such caution is self-evident. One might reasonably prefer a different cautious choice, an Amy Klobuchar or one of the failed-to-launch moderates — but Biden is the only one who appears viable, the only not-Sanders candidate who still has a clear-enough path to the nomination. And with Super Tuesday upon us, for cautious Democrats there may be no alternative.
The same case for the advantages of caution applies to what a Biden presidency might bring. He will not induce Mitch McConnell to pass “Medicare for All” or make college free, or perform the prestidigitation on the country’s regulatory system that Warren promises. But in a world with a Republican-controlled or 50-50 Senate, he is somewhat less likely than other candidates to see his agenda gridlocked from the start, more likely to successfully jawbone Joe Manchin on health care or Pat Toomey on guns, and perhaps modestly more likely to gain a Democratic majority in the Senate after 2022.
You lose any immediate chance at sweeping change, in other words, but you gain some room for incrementalism that greater ideological ambition might foreclose.
Finally, the strongest argument for Biden is nonideological: More than the other candidates, he offers the possibility of a calmer presidency, where politics fades a bit from the daily headlines, where the average American is less bombarded by social-media swarms and cable-news freakouts, where gridlock and polarization persist but their stakes feel modestly reduced.
I’ll be honest: It wouldn’t be good news for political columnists, but as a citizen it doesn’t sound that bad.

Santa Rosa credit union hires good Samaritan fired by US Bank for giving $20 to a struggling customer

Texto completo: Emily James, by all accounts, is uncommonly generous. On Christmas Eve, she paid dearly for it.
A senior customer service officer at a U.S. Bank call center in Portland, Oregon, she was on the phone with a customer in distress.
He’d deposited his paycheck, but the bank put a hold on it. Earlier in the day, he’d been assured the hold would be lifted, and that he’d soon be able to buy gifts for his children. It wasn’t. Stranded at a gas station, his tank empty, he called the bank and spoke to James, who tried to get the hold lifted. Unable to do that, she drove 20 minutes — on her break — and handed him $20.
Instead of celebrating her for that stellar customer service, U.S. Bank fired her, along with the manager who approved the trip, for an unauthorized interaction with a customer.
In a twist reminiscent of “It’s Wonderful Life,” the 33-year-old good Samaritan has landed on her feet — in Santa Rosa. Impressed by her willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty, Community First Credit Union invited James to fly down for a series of interviews. A week later, Community First offered her a job as a training specialist.
“Their attitude was, ‘Hey, we see that this person cares, and that’s the kind of person we want working for us,’ ” said James, who has lived in Portland for the last 25 years.
Community First was impressed by James’ willingness to go above and beyond the call. “This is something we encourage,” said David Williams, the credit union’s marketing chief. “We try to hire people with that sort of helpful DNA.”
How soon does she start?
“As soon as I find a place to live,” James said.
By coincidence, Community First had bestowed its most recent Employee of the Quarter Award on a woman who came to the aid of a distressed customer. An elderly woman walked out of the Lakeport branch, only to discover that her car was stolen. When she returned to the credit union, loan officer Alexandra Wiggs took her by the hand, called the police, helped the woman fill out a police report, then drove her home.
“We gave Alex an award for that,” Williams said. “What Emily did wasn’t that dissimilar” — although the result certainly was. “I thought, I want to meet this woman.”
He’d learned about James while reading a Feb. 1 story by Nicholas Kristof, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the New York Times. After the Oregonian in Portland first told James’ story in January, Kristof wrote a column about her, eviscerating U.S. Bank, and holding it up as an example of “how some companies have lost their souls.”
So comprehensive was his takedown that the bank’s CEO, Andrew Cecere phoned him shortly after his story appeared online. “This is not who we are,” Cecere insisted. Shifting into damage control mode, the bank offered James and her boss their jobs back.
Thanks but no thanks, replied James, who didn’t trust the bank to treat her fairly. She worried about retaliation, “just based on the way they’d talked to me, and treated me.”
Fired with no severance, unable to collect unemployment benefits or qualify for food stamps during the month of January, she sold her plasma, and returned used cans — “anything I could do for extra cash.”
Unable to afford her $2,200-a-month diabetes medication without her company-paid medical insurance, she has simply gone without.
In the wake of Kristof’s column which reached a global audience, she was inundated with messages from well-wishers and some potential employers. “It was overwhelming and humbling,” she recalled.
Early in the courtship, Williams of Community First asked James if she’d be willing to relocate to Santa Rosa. She replied immediately in the affirmative. “The weather sucks here,” she said.
James visited Community First’s offices on Valentine’s Day. “It wasn’t the nervous jitters you get for an interview,” she recalled. “The culture there is great. Everybody was super kind from the get-go.”
The culture of the Santa Rosa credit union contrasts sharply with that of the stockholder-owned banking colossus James had just left. A credit union is a nonprofit cooperative, owned by its members, “the very people who use us,” Williams said. They’re also local by nature. Community First only takes deposits from, and makes loans to, customers “in our five-county footprint.”
James, by all accounts, was a natural fit. When the Community First employees who’d met and interviewed her compared notes, they agreed she was “a credit union person in a banker’s body,” Williams said.
Community First had intended to beef up its training department, “and then Emily fell out of the sky,” he said.
“She’ll be a great asset to our members,” Williams said. “And she can train people to be like her. She can make us better.”
James is eager to get started — as soon as she can find housing for herself and her dependents: Domino, a half-Great Dane rescue “whose legs operate independently from one another — she’s a big doofus but I love her to death”; and the terrier Harley Quinn, her emotional support animal. Both are featured on the Instagram account @DominoHarleyQuinn, “because I am that dog parent.”
Although she knows few people in Sonoma County, and will be leaving many friends behind, James is “more excited than nervous” about the move.
If you let fear govern your decisions, she said, “you’re never going to grow and learn.”
And there is the weather.

Brooks: The case for Mike Bloomberg

Texto completo: The best case for Mike Bloomberg is that he’s a brilliant debater who has a witty riposte for every line of attack.
OK. Let me start over. The best case for Mike Bloomberg is that he is not a brilliant debater. He can’t whip a rally crowd into an ideological frenzy. The best case for Bloomberg is that we’ve already elected a reality TV star to the White House. We need somebody who can actually run things.
We need somebody who can actually lead a government, staff an administration with talented professionals and do the mundane but essential tasks of pushing legislation and executing laws. We need somebody who will turn down the ideological temperature, so we don’t rip ourselves apart as a nation. We have enough politicians who cater to people who treat politics as the place they go to get self-indulgent moral affirmation baths. We need someone who can improve the lives of actual Americans.
Bloomberg was one of the most successful mayors of this century. He was a Republican who left office with two-thirds of New Yorkers saying he made their city a better place.
I’m not endorsing Bloomberg. I think it’s a mistake for journalists, even opinion journalists, to endorse, and I’d be fine with many of the candidates. But I just want to throw Bloomberg’s record before you:
Education: As mayor, Bloomberg took over a dysfunctional school system and instituted a series of fantastically successful reforms. When he became mayor, less than half of New York City students were graduating from high school on time. When he left, nearly two-thirds did so within four years. He replaced large failing schools with small attentive schools. The graduation rates in those places surged from 38% to 68%. Under Bloomberg test scores rose more quickly than in other cities. The black-white achievement gap decreased by 23%.
Job creation: Bloomberg inherited a city reeling from the 9/11 attacks and helped kick-start an economic boom. He inherited a city that was economically over-reliant on Wall Street and had a relatively tiny tech sector. Now New York receives the second highest amount of tech investment, after Silicon Valley. He led the effort to create an applied sciences university on Roosevelt Island that will supply the city with talent for generations. Private sector jobs increased by 10% during the last four years of his term alone. The mayor’s office said that 29,000 people found jobs through the city’s career centers in 2012, compared to 500 people in 2004.
Housing: Bloomberg rezoned about 40% of New York City and helped spark a neighborhood renaissance along just about every waterway in the city. He led a $2.4 billion expansion of the subway system to serve the new Hudson Yards neighborhood. He managed to finance 170,000 new affordable housing units, even while the state and federal governments slashed housing budgets.
Health and the environment: He banned artificial trans fats and smoking from bars and restaurants. New York experienced about a 30% decline in adult smoking over his tenure. Meanwhile his administration added more than 850 acres of parkland, reduced greenhouse-gas emissions in city-owned buildings, and created a bike-share program. Life expectancy in New York is now 81.2 years, more than two years longer than the national average.
Crime: Stop-and-frisk is obviously a blot on Bloomberg’s record. His focus on crime data made him blind to the human beings who were mistreated by his policies. And yet during his tenure homicide rates dropped by 65% and shootings dropped by 55%. In Bloomberg’s final year there were only 335 murders in New York, comparable to the 1950s.
Budgets: He raised property taxes on the most affluent citizens and used the money to boost city services. When he entered office the city budget was $42 billion. When he left it was about $70 billion.
The case against Bloomberg is that he’s said insensitive stuff and he didn’t succeed in making New York more equal. The case for him is that he led an immense amount of change that made life better overall. You decide. Does America need more gridlock and ideological fireworks or a practical manager who gets stuff done?

Texto completo: Dr. Gregory Ramey, quien por muchos años ejerció como psicólogo infantil en Dayton (Ohio) y era columnista sindicado de temas pediátricos, ha sido acusado de 145 delitos relacionados con pornografía infantil.
Ramey (70) fue acusado el jueves de los cargos y se entregó a la cárcel del condado Greene.
El conocido psicólogo pediátrico fue uno de los rostros públicos de Dayton Children’s Hospital, escribiendo una columna semanal para padres en el Dayton Daily News que se distribuyó en el servicio de cable del New York Times, y haciendo apariciones frecuentes en medios de comunicación.
“Este abuso atroz de la confianza de los pacientes, por no hablar de la confianza del público, por parte de un médico, es terriblemente horrible”, dijo el fiscal general de Ohio, Dave Yost. “Los niños pequeños son inocentes, dulces y confiados: son frágiles y necesitan protección especial”.
Ramey fue identificado como fuente de descargas electrónicas de pornografía infantil , según la Oficina del Fiscal General de Ohio. Se dice que los crímenes ocurrieron entre enero de 2012 y julio de 2019.
Si es declarado culpable, podría ser encarcelado por el resto de su vida
“Ciertamente tenemos todo lo que necesitamos para esta acusación y eso debería ser suficiente para asegurarnos de que se mantenga alejado por un buen tiempo”, dijo Yost a ABC News.
La acusación cubre 90 imágenes que representan a 40 niños menores de 10 años, ninguno de los cuales era su paciente, detalló Yost.
Cuando el empleador de Ramey, el Hospital de Niños de Dayton, fue informado de la investigación, lo colocó inmediatamente en licencia administrativa y luego lo despidió.
Ese hospital, donde trabajó desde 1979, emitió un comunicado el jueves luego de la acusación de Ramey.
“En su papel profesional, el Dr. Ramey fue un defensor del bienestar mental de los niños y un orador frecuente en temas de peligro y explotación infantil (…) Por lo tanto, nos sorprendieron las acusaciones de comportamiento inapropiado en su vida personal. Nada en el desempeño de su rol profesional creó sospechas. Estamos conmocionados y profundamente preocupados por estas acusaciones, que están en marcado contraste con nuestra misión y valores fundamentales”.
La licencia de Ramey para practicar psicología en Ohio todavía está activa, pero ello podría cambiar.
“Somos conscientes de la acusación y su encarcelamiento, y estamos identificando las opciones disponibles en estas circunstancias”, dijo el Director Ejecutivo de la Junta de Psicología de Ohio, Ronald Ross.

Bouie: The case for Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: If he wins the nomination, whether outright or at the Democratic Party convention this summer, Sen. Bernie Sanders will be the most left-wing politician ever nominated for president and the only self-described “socialist” to ever run on the ballot line for either of the two major parties.
Many Democrats, especially moderates, think this is a disaster in waiting. They look back to 1972, when a different left-wing senator, George McGovern of South Dakota, was crushed by Richard Nixon, losing his home state and 48 others. They see a winnable election against a vulnerable incumbent potentially squandered by a candidate with radical views. They think Sanders will not only give Trump a victory, but a decisive one.
This could happen, but it probably won’t. The persistent belief that Sanders is unelectable is unfounded. The evidence says he can win.
The first step to winning is unifying the party, and Sanders can do that. He has a higher favorability rating among Democratic voters than any other candidate. A recent Monmouth University poll gives him a net rating of 53 points (72% favorable to 19% unfavorable) compared with 48 points for Elizabeth Warren and 38 points for former Vice President Joe Biden.
Quinnipiac shows a similar spread, as well as strong ratings from moderate and conservative Democrats. And the vast majority of Democrats, 93%, say they would back Sanders against Trump. As a point of comparison, 88% say the same for Pete Buttigieg.
Sanders also fares well against the president in preliminary matchups. He has led Trump in nearly every poll since the start of 2019 and does better than most other candidates in the crucial swing states, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that delivered Trump the White House. Yes, head-to-head polls aren’t as reliable now as they’ll be in the summer, after the conventions, or in the fall, when the general election starts in earnest. But if, on the strength of the polls, you believe a candidate like Biden can beat Trump, then you should think the same of Sanders.
As for the fear that Sanders would be another McGovern? Hyperpolarization makes that highly unlikely. In today’s political environment, winning either party’s nomination gives you a high electoral floor. If Sanders does lose, he won’t lose big.
The easiest objection to all of this is that Sanders has never been scrutinized like a presidential nominee. What will voters think when they learn he’s a socialist, “democratic” or otherwise? How will they react to footage of Sanders praising Cuba or singing “This Land Is Your Land” while on a honeymoon in the Soviet Union? Sanders has strong personal appeal, but can it survive an onslaught of Republican attacks? Will voters punish him for flying too far from the mainstream?
Again, it’s possible. But it’s also true that the mainstream isn’t as conservative as many believe. Lots of progressive ideas are popular with the public, sometimes incredibly so. And while voters are skeptical of the most expansive proposals, they aren’t reflexively hostile.
There’s something else to consider. In a world where Democrats as moderate as Bill Clinton have been accused of “socialism,” the word has simply lost its punch. Republicans can say it and voters will hear it, but they may not care.
At the end of the day, Sanders is the only candidate who can plausibly unite the anti-Trump majority of the electorate. He’s as popular with people who dislike partisan politics as he is with rank-and-file Democrats. With his forceful attacks on corruption and bigotry, he can speak directly to the concerns about Trump’s character and personality that have alienated moderate suburban whites and helped give Democrats the House of Representatives.
His “independent” persona might alienate people in the Democratic establishment, but it’s a powerful asset for the general election. It makes him a different kind of Democrat, removed from Washington in a way that appeals to much of the public.
That is why Sanders is uniquely electable. Despite his age, he promises a true break with the past.

Texto completo: As anyone who’s been even a casual observer of The Texas Tribune knows, we’re at an inflection point in the life of our business — the start of a second decade, successful financially, healthy culturally, admired across Texas and around the world for our journalism, our drive, and our willingness to take risks and think differently.
So when Emily Ramshaw and Amanda Zamora stepped aside to pursue their dream of launching their own nonprofit news startup and we began the process of hiring their successors, we had legitimate questions about the road ahead. Safe or risky? Conventional or unconventional? Tactics (a to-do list of tweaks and priorities to be executed upon) or strategy (a vision for what we could become)? Solve the problems of the last 10 years or leverage the possibilities of the next 10?
The biggest question of all: What is the role and responsibility of a news organization at this moment, in this state, in this democracy?
After considering a truly amazing range of qualified applicants to follow Emily and Amanda, including multiple finalists in each case who would have been exceptional colleagues, I’m so excited to tell you that we’ve chosen two people who have changed and challenged our industry — and will change and challenge us.
Our new editorial director will be Stacy-Marie Ishmael, a superlative journalist and inspiring leader, role model and public citizen who, over a stellar career, has been a senior editor at Apple, managing editor for mobile at BuzzFeed News and vice president of communities at the Financial Times. Stacy is among the smartest, most engaging and most passionate people I’ve encountered in more than 30 years of making hires like this one. As she told me when we met, she loves news — particularly local news — and newsrooms, loves building and running teams, loves developing leaders, and is deeply committed to ensuring the business we’re in is representative and inclusive of the people and populations we serve.
Stacy’s values are our values. Her enthusiasms are our enthusiasms. Her strengths complement ours. Her ambitions exceed ours. She will push us every day to work smarter, think more creatively, and produce better and more impactful reporting and events — to reach more people in more places and live more fully into our public service mission. A native of Trinidad, Stacy is a graduate of the London School of Economics.
Our new chief product officer will be Millie Tran, most recently deputy off-platform editor at The New York Times and previously its global growth editor. A superlative journalist and inspiring leader in her own right, Millie, too, is an alum of BuzzFeed, where she was director of global adaptation and editor of mobile news, working alongside Stacy. She has also worked at the American Press Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations and National Journal. When she made a big splash as the keynote speaker at last year’s International Symposium on Online Journalism, Millie explained that she’s obsessed with how people get and share news, likes anticipating change and trends and peering around the corner to see where things are going, and is a systems thinker.
In discussing this job with me and others at the Tribune, it quickly became clear that Millie’s mix of skills, experiences and interests — her intelligence, her empathy, her intuitive sense — set her up for success. She will expertly guide our audience, loyalty, design and technology teams as we work together to engage new readers in new places and new spaces. Born in Vietnam, Millie is a graduate of UCLA.
These are two immensely impressive people. We are so lucky to get to work with them. It’s a measure of how far we’ve come as an organization that we could attract the likes of Stacy and Millie to join us and lead us.
Stacy’s first day is March 23. Millie’s is April 13. Cannot wait! Please join me in welcoming them to the Tribune family.

Goldberg: The case for Elizabeth Warren

Autor: Goldberg, Michelle.

Texto completo: On Tuesday night, after the latest Democratic debate, Ann Coulter tweeted, “Sen. Warren has convinced me that Bernie isn’t that worrisome. He’ll never get anything done. SHE’S the freak who will show up with 17 idiotic plans every day and keep everyone up until it gets done.” Vicious reactionary that she is, Coulter cut to the heart of Elizabeth Warren’s promise.
Warren has an almost supernatural ability to identify problems before anyone else and to work relentlessly to solve them. Of all the Democratic candidates, she would make the most effective president. (Full disclosure: My husband, a graphic designer and creative director, works as a consultant for her.)
In 2007, Warren, then a Harvard law professor, wrote an article in the journal Democracy calling for the creation of what she called a Financial Product Safety Commission. “It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house,” she wrote. “But it is possible to finance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same one-in-five chance of putting the family out on the street.” This was before a cascade of mortgage failures set off the financial crisis, which she foresaw.
Warren realized that complexity was being weaponized against consumers, pointing out that a typical credit card contract had grown from one page in the 1980s to more than 30 pages two decades later. Ordinary people didn’t have the bandwidth to understand the terms they were agreeing to, allowing lenders to fleece them.
Four years later her brainchild, now called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was a reality. It’s no small thing for someone who had little direct government experience to single-handedly spearhead the creation of a new agency. The CFPB has since provided $12.4 billion in relief to 31 million consumers.
I was one of them. As I’ve written before, I turned to the CFPB after discovering that my bank had enrolled me, without my knowledge, in a dubious program that purported to protect users’ credit. The bank had been fined $700 million in connection with it, but that didn’t get me my money back. So I went to the CFPB website, where I filled out a simple form. A few weeks later, my bank notified me that I was being refunded more than $11,000.
That experience is part of why my husband signed up to consult with Warren. (To design her logo, he went to the Statue of Liberty to find the precise color of green.)
What amazed me about the CFPB was its seamlessness. As Will Wilkinson has written, Warren’s agenda, with its blizzard of plans and calls for “big structural change,” has been painted as “contentiously ideological and bureaucratically suffocating.” This perception is upside down. Warren’s genius is using the regulatory process to make it simple for ordinary people to stand up to financial behemoths. She knows how excessive bureaucracy can be a tool of domination and how to defend people from it.
Even if a Democrat wins the presidency in November, Democrats won’t be able to pass significant legislation unless they both take the Senate and eliminate the filibuster. That will make Warren’s mastery of the levers of executive power particularly important. As a senator, she was known for zeroing in on seemingly obscure appointments, understanding how, say, having the wrong person as an undersecretary for domestic finance could translate into real-world suffering. She has plans to use executive action to address problems like student loan debt and prescription drug prices.
Warren also has the most inspirational personal story of any of the contenders. The daughter of a maintenance man, she dropped out of college to get married, then returned to school to become a special ed teacher. When she lost her job after getting pregnant, she went to law school and soared to the top of her field. Many candidates would present such an extraordinary rise as evidence of unique personal grit, but Warren sees it as a parable about how good government policy can enable social mobility.
Unlike Bernie Sanders, she doesn’t carry the electoral albatross of socialism; she wants to purify capitalism of stifling corruption so it works as it should. Not for nothing is her dog, Bailey, named after the virtuous small-town banker played by Jimmy Stewart in “It’s a Wonderful Life.”
Under Trump, the U.S. government has become a squalid orgy of self-dealing. There is not a person on earth better suited to clean it up than Warren. If this were a Jimmy Stewart movie, she’d come from behind to win the nomination. Right now that possibility looks remote, but as long as she’s still in the race and most of America hasn’t voted, it’s not too late for the nightmare of the Trump era to give way to a Hollywood ending.

Bruni: The case for Pete Buttigieg

Texto completo: In different circles at different points over the past year, it has been fashionable to hate Pete Buttigieg: He’s too clearly full of himself. He’s too far ahead of himself. What business does the 38-year-old former mayor of a relatively small city have running for president? What real claim to the job?
How about this: He has drawn closer to it than prominent senators who came out of the gate with much more heat on them and were gone even before Iowans caucused. He outpaced and outlasted seasoned governors whose popularity across a broad section of the political spectrum was supposed to be electoral magic. Before hitting a snag in Nevada, he had more delegates from Iowa and New Hampshire than any of his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, including Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who began building their political bases and growing their political careers before Buttigieg was born. His surname is a nearly impenetrable thicket of consonants (BOOT-edge-edge), and yet tens of millions of Americans can now pronounce it just fine.
You cannot chalk that up to novelty. You cannot call it a fluke. It’s a powerful testament to his knacks for fashioning a message that resonates with Americans, delivering it clearly, avoiding unnecessary trouble and mobilizing support. Those talents are precisely the ones that the person sitting at the Resolute Desk needs most. Buttigieg’s campaign is his credential, and it’s a compelling one.
Undertaking a bid for the White House at his age indeed suggests hubris. But getting this far reflects a phenomenal work ethic, a stubborn optimism, extraordinary intelligence and preternatural poise. Those traits, too, are ideal for a president, and none of his rivals possess them in greater measure.
I do wish that he had more miles on his odometer. The way you manage the curves in the road ahead is to draw on the lessons of the hairpin turns before. I’m also concerned about his apparent blind spots on race, but I appreciate his refreshing acknowledgment of missteps. He means to be better. And the thing about students determined to get straight A’s is that they do the homework necessary to make the honor roll.
Buttigieg understands the greatest problem that America faces, which isn’t income inequality, racial injustice, climate change or an obsolete infrastructure. It’s fragmentation. That makes progress on all of those other fronts impossible. America is too divided to move forward. Americans dwell on too many islands with too much fury in the air and too few bridges between them. Buttigieg has not only talked about that more frequently and eloquently than many of the other Democrats in the race, he has made life choices that push against it.
He signed up for military service after he went door-to-door for Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign and observed the wildly disproportionate representation of some American communities in the armed forces, which don’t exactly teem with Harvard-educated wunderkinds like him. To work in government, he didn’t head to Washington. He planted himself and deepened his roots in South Bend, Indiana, the frumpy Rust Belt city in which he’d grown up.
His detractors look at those lines on his résumé and see the eerily perfect machinations of an upstart who scribbled drafts of his inauguration address in crayons when he was still in diapers. Maybe. But, out of diapers, he put in time in places where similarly privileged young men and women typically don’t.
Buttigieg, who is married to another man, has also taken gorgeous aim at tribalism and prejudice. Last year, addressing Mike Pence’s creed-driven homophobia, he said: “Your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.” More recently, he questioned many conservatives’ invocation of “family values” by comparing his commitment to his husband with President Donald Trump’s payment of hush money to a porn star.
In those words I heard more than pithy sound bites. I heard a declaration that Americans can’t and shouldn’t tuck one another into categories. I heard his own claim to transcend any single identity: to be many identities at once. That’s the very definition of this country. With uncommon grace, Pete Buttigieg embodies it.

Texto completo: So, our Coronavirus Czar is going to be … Mike Pence. Feeling more secure?
“I know full well the importance of presidential leadership,” the vice president said as soon as he was introduced in his new role.
Totally qualified. First criteria for every job in this administration is capacity for praising the gloriousness of our commander in chief.
Yeah, when you think of Mike Pence you maybe don’t think about Pandemic Fighter Supreme. But as President Donald Trump pointed out repeatedly, he has already run Indiana.
Well, it probably could have been worse. Having a czar does make you feel there’s somebody in charge. At least Trump didn’t come before the cameras and announce solemnly, “Today I’m asking every American to cross your fingers.”
Our president had to be going crazy over a problem that involves both declining stock prices and germs. This is the guy, after all, who thinks shaking hands is “barbaric,” who is followed around by aides bearing sanitizer. During his news conference he told the story of a fever-ridden supporter who gave him a hug. Do you think it was an apocryphal fantasy? Either way, the idea has been haunting him forever.
Meanwhile, he’s come up with a totally new explanation for the stock market skid. It turns out investors were not frightened so much by the pandemic as the Democratic debate.
“I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,” Trump told reporters.
Plus that virus thing is … not necessarily a big deal. What really “shocked” him, Trump said, was his discovery that “the flu in our country kills 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year.”
So the problems are the Democrats and the flu. The answers are Mike Pence and … reminding the public once again that Nancy Pelosi’s district has a big homeless problem.
Earlier in the day Trump argued, via tweet, that despite the expressions of concern by the evil media and “incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades,” the government is perfectly prepared to handle the coronavirus. Which he misspelled “caronavirus.” But nobody’s perfect.
The president had been saying everything is totally under control for some time. (“It’s one person coming in from China.”) The whole administration picked up the cry. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, 82, overcame his habit of dozing off at meetings long enough to tell Fox Business Network that the disease would “accelerate the return of jobs” from overseas.
Trump totally agrees. “What it’s going to do is keep people home, and they’re going to travel to places we have,” he said.
See? The virus thing is a bonus.
The runup to the Pence unveiling had not been exactly calming for citizens who wanted to have faith in competent White House oversight. Barack Obama used to have special epidemic-watching groups just in case this kind of crisis developed. One was headed by the highly regarded Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who got sent packing by John Bolton. Another infectious disease expert, Tom Bossert, suddenly vanished from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018, presumably also at the hand of John You-know-who.
If Bolton’s memoir ever makes it into print, do you think it’ll have a chapter called “My War on Pandemic Fighters?” OK, probably not.
Virus Week hasn’t really provided a whole lot of comfort to citizens who wanted to believe the president’s replacements were super high quality.
The nation got its first real look at Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, who appeared before a Senate subcommittee and admitted he had no idea how the virus was transmitted among humans, exactly how dangerous it was, or … pretty much anything.
When Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, who is not known for anti-administration bias, asked whether the country had enough respirators to deal with a coronavirus epidemic, Wolf answered in the affirmative.
“We just heard testimony that we don’t,” Kennedy responded.
“OK,” said Wolf.
To be fair, he’s only been on the job since November. He’s the fifth head of homeland security Trump’s had in the last three years. Good thing he has a deputy — or at least an acting deputy — to help. That would be Ken Cuccinelli, who made news this week when he went on Twitter to ask for tips on how to find an online map of coronavirus sites posted by Johns Hopkins University. (“Here’s hoping it goes back up soon.”)
Losing faith in presidential appointees for health protection? Stop being so negative. They’re all vetted by the Presidential Personnel Office, which is now headed by John McEntee, 29, who was previously fired from another White House job because of concerns about a history of gambling problems and tax issues.
McEntee will be getting plenty of help from other stellar appointees, the newest being a 23-year-old college undergraduate. Together they’re going to be cleaning house, getting rid of folks who are insufficiently loyal to the president. Or maybe aren’t qualified or something. Never can tell.
Also part of the new coronavirus response team is Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services — a veteran Cabinet member and experienced former pharmaceutical lobbyist.
At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Azar was asked if he’d consider using some of the billions of dollars in funds for Trump’s border wall to help combat the current health crisis.
Azar just chuckled. Actually, people, this is probably not a theme we ought to be pursuing. Chances are, if the president is encouraged to mix the subjects of coronavirus and Mexico walls, he’ll suddenly announce that we need a barrier much bigger and thicker and more expensive, so it can stop the flow of immigrant germs.

Texto completo: Since President Donald Trump took office, Democrats have been having a passionate debate about what matters more: increasing progressive turnout or winning over swing voters. And there is no doubt that both tactics help Democrats win elections. But the evidence about which tactic matters more is pretty overwhelming. Persuasion does.
Take one stark pattern: In the 2018 midterms, many Democratic candidates who ran persuasion campaigns flipped areas that had gone for Trump in 2016. Not a single Democrat won a competitive state or House district with an unabashedly progressive campaign.
Yet the presidential field is dominated by candidates who haven’t had to worry about persuading swing voters in years, if ever. Delaware (Joe Biden’s home), Massachusetts (Elizabeth Warren’s) and Vermont (Bernie Sanders’) all voted against Trump by large margins. Pete Buttigieg and Mike Bloomberg were each the mayor of an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
The best case for Amy Klobuchar is that she’s the only remaining candidate with a track record of winning over the kind of voters that the Democrats will need to beat Trump. She has built her career on a middle-class image that avoids the leftism of Sanders or Warren and the elitism of Buttigieg or Bloomberg. As for Biden, Klobuchar looks sharper than he does — and she has a much more impressive electoral history.
She won all three of her Senate campaigns in Minnesota by more than 20 percentage points. Trump, by comparison, lost the state by only 1.5 points in 2016. Klobuchar did it by winning suburbs that normally lean right and holding her own in many rural areas.
Her strategy isn’t exactly a secret. It is the same one that many congressional Democrats used in 2018, and not so different from Barack Obama’s approach to his 2012 reelection. She emphasizes the pocketbook issues on which Democrats hold a huge advantage over Republicans. She doesn’t make voters anxious by promising utopian dreams, like a mandatory version of Medicare that would ban private insurance. She promises to reduce the cost of medical care — and points out that Republicans will raise those costs.
Klobuchar also finds ways to demonstrate her respect to voters who disagree with her on many issues. She describes Minnesota as “a proud hunting state” and visits each of its 87 counties every year. She doesn’t take unpopular positions on immigration, like border decriminalization.
And yet Klobuchar is hardly a centrist. She wants to raise taxes on the rich, break up monopolies, vastly expand Medicare, fight climate change, admit more refugees, allow immigrants in the country illegally to become citizens, ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. A Klobuchar administration would probably be well to the left of the Obama administration.
Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president, has long said that he is conservative but not angry about it. Klobuchar is progressive without being angry about it. The combination can allow a politician to win the middle without being of that middle.
At this stage, of course, Klobuchar is unlikely to be the nominee. She hasn’t quite figured out how to adapt her approach for the scale of a presidential race. Too often, she still seems to be running for Senate, talking about committee assignments and legislative co-sponsors instead of telling a story about the country.
Still, Democrats would be wise to remember that her success in Minnesota is no mystery. It is the main way Democrats have won elections over the past decade, and it’s a strategy that any Democratic nominee, even Sanders, can mimic:
Pound away at simple economic issues — on which the country’s voters are legitimately progressive. Deemphasize cultural issues — on which voters are much more divided. And don’t give in to fantasies involving millions of left-wing nonvoters who are just waiting to show up at the polls.

China's Gold Medalist and Doping; Spare a thought for those who were denied their Olympic moments.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has shined a spotlight on China's theft of intellectual property. Today there are new questions about the Chinese Olympic team and the potential theft of dreams and medals.
"Sun Yang, the three-time Olympic swimming champion from China, was suspended from competition for eight years for a drug-testing violation," report Victor Mather, Karen Crouse and Tariq Panja in the New York Times. They add that the six-time Olympic medalist "had been fighting a multiyear battle with the World Anti-Doping Agency" and report:
WADA brought a complaint against Sun, currently China's most famous athlete, to the court after swimming's international governing body declined to penalize him for refusing to cooperate with three antidoping officials who had traveled to his home in China to retrieve blood and urine samples.
During that confrontation in September 2018, Sun argued with the testers and his mother ordered a security guard to break his blood-sample vials with a hammer. Sun declined to submit a urine sample.
Mr. Sun claims he is innocent. The Timesfolk note that the Chinese swimming team has a history:
This appears to be the biggest Chinese doping scandal since more than 30 of its swimmers were caught using banned substances in the 1990s and 40 of its 300 athletes were withdrawn by Chinese authorities from competing at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, a number for suspicious blood-test results.
The Journal's Stu Woo writes that Mr. Sun also has a history :
He has also been dogged by accusations of cheating. In 2014, he was barred from competition for three months after testing positive for a banned substance. He said he didn't realize the substance, which he said was for a heart condition, had been disallowed.
Karen Crouse covered the 2019 world championships for the Times :
On Sunday, the Australian Mack Horton refused to join Sun on the medals podium and dignify Sun's victory in the 400-meter freestyle. The reigning Olympic champion, Horton, 23, finished second, then stood silently behind the podium, an act that earned him a public reprimand from FINA, the sport's international governing body. Sun's fans choked Horton's social media feed with vitriol, including death threats.
That didn't stop Duncan Scott of Britain from entering the fray Tuesday during the medals ceremony for the 200-meter freestyle. Scott, who tied for third, refused to shake Sun's hand or pose for photographs with the winner after the medal ceremony.
Sun, a 6-foot-6 behemoth, pointed at Scott's chest as they left the pool area and appeared to shout, "You loser, I'm winning, yes!"
Sun then continued goading Scott, who smiled and kept walking.
In a 2019 account from the Australian Associated Press, Mr. Horton explained the moments before his protest:
"I wasn't sure if I was going to do it but I did it at the last minute because I didn't want to live with the regret... Standing there, it was tense, it was awkward. No one really knew what to do and then all of a sudden the crowd realised what was going on and started applauding and I guess filled me with emotion and I was like 'OK, this was the right thing to do'."
Today in the Sydney Morning Herald, Phil Lutton sums up the resolution of the controversy: "Game, set, Mack." Fortunately the Aussie had sometimes been able to triumph even when his rival arrived in the pool with questionable body chemistry. The Herald report adds of Mr. Horton's experience at the 2016 Summer Olympics:
He appeared in Brazil as Sun's chief challenge in the 400m and the controversial and temperamental Chinese champion could sniff the threat. Perhaps thinking the inexperienced Horton was mentally frail, he splashed him in a training pool incident just days out from their race in Rio, hoping the confrontation would rattle Horton on the big stage.
How wrong he would end up being. Horton instead went on the front foot, emerging from the heats to lambast Sun as a "drug cheat", before beating him in the final that set the scene for an extraordinary series of actions and reactions over the coming days, weeks and years.
Sadly, sometimes justice can take much longer. In 2016, Karen Crouse reported in the Times on Shirley Babashoff, perhaps the most mistreated of the 20th Century's great swimming champions:
Babashoff arrived at the Montreal Olympics in 1976 with a chance to match the performance in 1972 of Mark Spitz, whose seven golds sealed his status as an American icon and propelled him into a career as a product pitchman. Babashoff, a teammate of Spitz's at those Munich Olympics, swam significantly faster four years later only to settle for four Olympic silver medals and one relay gold. Her career path as a high-profile endorser and motivational speaker was blockaded by broad-backed, husky-voiced East Germans later found to have been unwitting victims of a government-sponsored doping program.
Shamed by the news media and shunned by swimming officials for pointing out her competitors' cartoonish musculature and suggesting they were cheating, Babashoff retreated into a self-imposed, decades-long exile. She raised her son, Adam, now 30, as a single mother well out of the spotlight while working as a postal carrier in Huntington Beach, Calif.
Ms. Crouse added:
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, documents were unearthed that revealed that huge doses of oral turinabol, an anabolic steroid derived from testosterone, had been administered to the men and women on the East German swim team, as part of a program overseen by the Ministry for State Security that treated aspiring Olympians, some of them not yet teenagers.
Not only was Ms. Babashoff cheated of her victories; she was branded a sore loser. According to the Times report:
"People criticized me for my poor sportsmanship," Babashoff said. "What was I going to say to the East Germans? 'Congratulations! You took the most steroids'?" After a sigh, she added: "People looked at me like I was the worst person in the world for saying the East German women looked like men. I said what I felt. Apparently, it didn't go over very well."
Competing against women synthetically engineered to have male characteristics, Ms. Babashoff and her all-female team still managed to win gold in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay, which in hindsight is among the greatest achievements in Olympic history.
To clarify, this column has no interest in receiving angry letters from the Bernie Sanders campaign demanding a correction. Therefore your humble correspondent will freely concede that even though East German officials cheated, lied, degraded the health of their own athletes and stole victories from honest competitors in order to promote a monstrous regime which enslaved and tortured its own citizens, they did manage to post superficially impressive swimming times.
The story of athletic programs overseen by communist governments is certainly a reason to reflect with a sense of gratitude that we do not live under one of the regimes admired by Mr. Sanders.
But this history should also inspire a sense of humility. As appalling as the abuses of Sanders-backed governments have been, right now even in many democratic countries in the West women are being forced to compete against biological males .

Afghanistan peace plan: Don’t assume the Taliban aren’t serious. Test them.

Resumen: There may never be a better opportunity to try to find a peaceful end to America's longest war.

Texto completo: The Afghan Taliban’s deputy leader Siraj Haqqani published an op-ed last week in The New York Times professing commitment to ending the war in Afghanistan peacefully. Backlash among Americans and Afghans came quickly, with many questioning why a violent insurgent leader warranted such a coveted platform, or how a non-English speaker could have penned something so fluent.
Both concerns miss the point. On the eve of potentially historic peace negotiations among Afghan leaders, this Taliban missive sent many of the signals one would hope to hear if an adversary were serious about negotiating — and Haqqani, the military commander most often cited as a Taliban “hardliner”, put his name on it.
Haqqani indisputably has Afghan and American blood on his hands. His family leads a network within the Taliban insurgency responsible for many of the Afghanistan war’s highest-profile attacks. He and the Taliban’s other top military commanders organize attacks that have killed thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghans.
International terror ties
It’s also true that Haqqani used elliptical, unsatisfying language to address the Taliban’s awful record on women’s rights (“the rights of women that are granted by Islam [will be] protected”), and ties to international terrorist groups (“it is not in the interest of any Afghan to allow such groups to hijack our country”).
These will be issues to work through at the negotiating table, difficult though that may prove. The more immediate question is whether the Taliban are serious about negotiating in the first place. It is therefore encouraging that the Taliban used their moment in such an intense spotlight as The New York Times to offer such reassurance.
Haqqani states fairly bluntly that the Taliban are ready for intra-Afghan negotiations after years of refusal (“we must be able to resolve intra-Afghan disagreements through talks”); that the objective is a political settlement (“to agree on a new, inclusive political system in which the voice of every Afghan is reflected”), and that the Taliban also want to stop the violence (“Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and maiming must stop. ”)
Could these statements be bald-faced deceptions, intended to coax the U. S. into leaving Afghanistan before assaulting a weakened Afghan government? Of course, though Haqqani’s rhetoric goes further than seems necessary for such a ploy. The alternative, that Taliban leaders (like all other parties to the conflict) see the war as increasingly futile and want to explore an alternate path, is a testable proposition.
More: Maybe our social media obsession is a bigger problem than Russian election interference
The test is to throw the full weight of American diplomacy into helping intra-Afghan negotiations succeed. Most immediately, this means safeguarding the “reduction in violence” which began early Saturday in Afghanistan; violence appears to have plummeted, suggesting all sides thus far are honoring the arrangement. Next, it means ensuring the Afghan government and Taliban send fair and inclusive delegations to intra-Afghan talks. If the talks do start, it means encouraging each side to find common ground on issues like the future structure of the government, who controls what territory on the ground, and the fates of tens of thousands of fighters and prisoners.
Doubt on women's rights
The Taliban’s opening positions on women’s rights, democracy and Afghanistan’s other gains since 2001 are unlikely to satisfy most of their fellow Afghans, or the United States and its allies. If agreement already existed on such issues at the heart of the conflict, talks would not be necessary. Negotiations are unpredictable, however, and successful peace agreements are often the result of hard-nosed negotiators persuading, cajoling and finally compromising their way to a deal that they might not initially have accepted or thought possible.
This particular negotiation also enjoys advantages that many others do not: a mutually hurting military stalemate, overwhelming popular support for peace, influential pro-peace factions within each camp, and a regional and international consensus that some form of peace agreement is desirable. There is also growing Afghan and international consensus that the status quo in Afghanistan is intolerable, while a hasty U. S. withdrawal without regard for the consequences could be even worse. These tailwinds are insufficient by themselves to deliver peace, but there may never be a better opportunity to try.
Now is therefore not the moment to mire in the shortcomings of the other side’s going-in positions, or on whether our adversary-turned-negotiating-counterpart deserves to publish an op-ed. It is a moment to test each side’s sincerity, launch intra-Afghan talks with all key players at the table, seek solutions to what divides them, and at last end this war.

Texto completo: In our constant 24/7 social media news cycle, it is common for negative news to rise to the top.
This can result in a pessimistic view of our world today and hinder the optimism and hope that is so important.
While often less sensational than negative news, the media could cite many positive narratives, statistics and facts. Nicholas Kristof, in a recent New York Times editorial ("This Has Been the Best Year Ever"), outlined impressive global poverty and health statistics that could be positive news headlines. These include: * The percentage of children dying by the age of 15 has dropped to 4%. As recently as 1950, it was 27%.
* Every single day, 325,000 people got their first access to electricity, 200,000 got piped water for the first time and 650,000 went online for the first time.
* The percentage of the planet’s population experiencing extreme poverty has plunged from 42% in 1981 to 10% today.
* As recently as 50 years ago, half the world’s population was illiterate. Today, we are approaching 90% adult literacy.
These statistics are wonderful, yet TV news and social media often focus on bad news and leave us believing every trend is going in the wrong direction.
This often happens when media reports about public education. News headlines often reference failing schools, low test scores and unmotivated students. In reality, public schools, nationally and in Illinois, are achieving the highest marks ever on key metrics. These notable statistics include: * Illinois’ four-year graduation rate is the highest ever at 86%, according to Illinois State Board of Education.
* College enrollment, within 12 months of graduation, grew to 72.5%, according to ISBE.
* For every major racial and ethnic group in America, student achievement is higher today than it was in the 1970s, according to the National Superintendents Roundtable and Horace Mann League.
* 76% of parents assign an A or B to the public school their oldest child attends, according to PDK Poll of America’s Attitude Toward the Public Schools.
* Nationwide, during the past 10 years, the number of students taking one or more Advanced Placement exams each year has increased by two-thirds to more than 2.8 million, according to College Board.
These statistics are impressive given that public schools are serving more than 50 million students (90% of all students), more students with special needs (13%) and more students in poverty than ever before.
Be encouraged to counter any negative thinking and celebrate the great job that your local public schools play in educating our children and serving your community.
* David Larson is superintendent of Glenbard High School District 87. His column appears monthly in Neighbor during the school year.

The foreboding in Trump’s NYT suit: ‘There will be more’

Resumen: [...]Wednesday’s suit is an important step beyond bluster to try to silence the press using the legal system — and just days after the president announced that he considers himself the country’s "chief law enforcement officer." [...]the Supreme Court has declared that opinion is constitutionally protected. [...]Trump must know it, because just three years ago he got a libel suit against him dismissed in the very same court in which he sued the Times on Wednesday on the grounds that what he had said about a critic was protected opinion. [...]whenever the nation’s leading newspaper reveals some new abuse of power or malfeasance in office, Trump can point out he is suing the Times. Some of us listened to Trump during the 2016 campaign and saw the threat he posed of reinstituting the law of seditious libel, the crime of challenging the government, long since eradicated from American law.

Texto completo: Wednesday was an ominous day for freedom of the press in this country, and I want to tell you why.
You may have heard or seen that President Trump filed a libel suit against the New York Times. Perhaps you weren’t surprised: the president is known to frequently disparage the Times even as he reads it obsessively. Borrowing a page from what I’ve referred to before as a Mount Rushmore of totalitarians, Robespierre, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, Trump loves to call the press the "enemy of the people."
But Wednesday’s suit is an important step beyond bluster to try to silence the press using the legal system — and just days after the president announced that he considers himself the country’s "chief law enforcement officer."
This new lawsuit is a joke under our current constitutional law of libel. It complains of an opinion piece written by a former executive editor of the Times, Max Frankel. Frankel, 89, a great journalist (and, admittedly, a friend of mine for more than 40 years), won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 and ran the Times opinion pages from 1977-86 and its news pages from 1986-94. His op-ed last March reflected his belief that Trump and Vladimir Putin of Russia were engaged in a symbiotic relationship, with Putin helping Trump gain power in this country while Trump sought to soften U.S. policy toward Russia.
Both of these elements — Putin’s help to Trump and Trump’s history of going easy on Putin — are established facts, with Trump’s own government reminding us again this month that Putin’s work continues, and numerous reports making clear that Trump has worked to placate Russia, even if others in his administration sometimes stymie this impulse. Whether, as Frankel argued, this suggests an implicit quid pro quo is the sort of opinion that belongs on, well, on the opinion pages, where it ran.
And the Supreme Court has declared that opinion is constitutionally protected. So this case should be readily dismissed. And Trump must know it, because just three years ago he got a libel suit against him dismissed in the very same court in which he sued the Times on Wednesday on the grounds that what he had said about a critic was protected opinion.
But the president sued anyway. He sued even though he had never complained about the story after it was published. He sued almost a year after the article was published, just ahead of the statute of limitations expiring.
On Wednesday, in a news briefing where he attempted to minimize the seriousness of the looming pandemic, he said "there will be more coming."
And that is the point. What is happening here is a cynical play to establish a talking point. Now, whenever the nation’s leading newspaper reveals some new abuse of power or malfeasance in office, Trump can point out he is suing the Times. Perhaps, he may hope, the Times news pages will even pull a punch or two to avoid being seen as a presidential adversary. (I hope, and trust, they will not. I hope Max Frankel’s successors will instruct their staffs that no one is to mention or even think of this silly lawsuit in considering other coverage of Trump.) This is not Donald Trump’s first libel suit, or the first such suit he has brought frivolously. Trump has been saying for nearly five years now that he wants to "open up the libel laws." Some of us listened to Trump during the 2016 campaign and saw the threat he posed of reinstituting the law of seditious libel, the crime of challenging the government, long since eradicated from American law. That threat took a new turn on Wednesday. This is an issue, amid all the craziness of the hour, that merits your attention, not least because "there will be more."

You may have heard or seen that President Trump filed a libel suit against the New York Times.

Borrowing a page from what I’ve referred to before as a Mount Rushmore of totalitarians, Robespierre, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, Trump loves to call the press the "enemy of the people."
But Wednesday’s suit is an important step beyond bluster to try to silence the press using the legal system — and just days after the president announced that he considers himself the country’s "chief law enforcement officer."
This new lawsuit is a joke under our current constitutional law of libel. It complains of an opinion piece written by a former executive editor of the Times, Max Frankel.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Friday he had not been arrested in apartheid South Africa when visiting Nelson Mandela in prison in the 1970s, despite previously saying so on the campaign trail.
"I said arrested. I meant I was not able to move," he told CNN. "I guess I wasn't arrested. I was stopped. I wasn't able to go where I wanted to go. "
His correction to the story caps off a controversy over the origins of an account fact-checkers at the Washington Post had called "ridiculous. "
“I had the great honor of meeting him,” Biden said while campaigning in South Carolina, according to a New York Times story this month. “I had the great honor of being arrested with our U. N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him. ”
Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, later told reporters the story had referred to the trip in the 1970s and that he "was separated from his party at the airport. "

Monmouth poll: New poll shows Biden with 20-point lead in South Carolina primary
In amending his account in Friday's CNN interview, Biden, a long-time former senator, said he had been visiting South Africa with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, when the "Afrikaners" with "their short pants and their guns" made him get off the plane and moved him in a "different direction" from the rest of the delegation.
According to Biden, South African officials wanted him and the black lawmakers in the delegation to go through two separate doors, but "I made it clear I wasn't going to move," and the officials eventually decided to take all of the lawmakers together to the baggage claim.
Biden faces his a crucial test in the South Carolina primary, where his campaign hopes for a big win after disappointing showings in the first three nomination contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.

Testing, funding for virus present issues

Texto completo: Georgia faces a couple of immediate challenges in its preparation for a potential coronavirus outbreak here.
One is true for many states: The process for testing patients for the disease is, at best, very slow.
The Georgia Public Health Lab recently received a diagnostic test kit from the CDC for COVID-19 (the name for the new coronavirus), but like those sent to other states, its components were flawed.
"We are waiting on new components from CDC, once we get them it will take about a week to do quality assessment and quality control to be sure everything works as it should,'' said Nancy Nydam, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health.
The second challenge - at least potentially - is funding. No special state funds have been allocated to fight COVID-19. The White House, though, has submitted a funding request to Congress. The federal funding is expected to go to additional testing capacity to identify cases, development of a vaccine and treatments for the disease, more personal protective equipment, and money for states to quarantine people and treat cases, officials said.
The Department of Public Health is confronting state budget cuts that are expected to impact local
health agencies. But a spokesman for Gov. Brian Kemp, Cody Hall, said that budget reductions "do not in any way affect the Department's ability to respond to a potential coronavirus case here in Georgia. If any emergency were to arise, the Department has a comprehensive plan in place to protect the public with significant state and federal funds at their disposal."
Nydam said that in developing agency budget cuts, the state and local epidemiology areas were spared. "Most of our current expenses are coming out of our Federal Emergency Preparedness Funds, which we expect to continue and to in fact increase in this federal fiscal year," she added.
Georgia has reported no COVID-19 cases. About 200 individuals linked to recent international travel here are "self-monitoring'' at home for possible symptoms of the disease. The number fluctuates as people complete the 14-day monitoring period and as more people are added based on lists the state receives from Customs and Border Protection, Nydam said.
Government response
The agency said Wednesday that it's providing information and guidance about COVID-19 to all Georgia health care facilities and holding weekly calls with the medical community to update information and answer questions.
State epidemiologists are on-call 24/7 to help health care providers evaluate individuals presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 to ensure that possible cases are managed safely, Public Health said.
"We urge Georgians to prepare for hurricanes or flooding or take measures to prevent flu, so preparing for an outbreak of COVID-19 is no different," said Dr. Kathleen Toomey, Public Health commissioner. "DPH is working to make sure our health systems, first responders and county health departments have the resources they need to respond to a COVID-19 outbreak."
Also Wednesday, President Trump announced he has appointed Vice President Pence to head the administration's response to the coronavirus crisis. Trump said aggressive public health containment measures and travel restrictions had successfully limited the spread of coronavirus in the United States.
But news of a California case has alarmed health experts.
The CDC said a person in California who was not exposed to anyone known to be infected with the virus and had not traveled to countries in which the virus is circulating, has tested positive for the infection.
It may be the first case of community spread in the U.S., the CDC said Wednesday.
"At this point, the patient's exposure is unknown," the CDC statement said. "The case was detected through the U.S. public health system and picked up by astute clinicians."
The patient is one of 60 confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S., Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Wednesday. Forty-two cases are former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent virus outbreak. Most of the other 15 were travelers coming back from China or their spouses. Three others were repatriated from China.
Worldwide, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exceeded 80,000. More than 2,700 deaths have been linked to the virus.
Test kit problem
Testing capacity is limited in the United States.
The CDC is manufacturing new test kits for states such as Georgia. Although a dozen states are capable of testing for coronavirus infection, confirmatory tests must still be done by the CDC, a process that can take days, the New York Times reported.
NPR reported Thursday that the CDC and FDA have resolved the problem with the testing kits.
Forty labs across the U.S. are already authorized to start using the modified test, and all 93 labs should be able to start testing by next week, Azar said.
Gov. Kemp said he's participated in two calls with President Trump's team and leaders from public health agencies and governors. He said he's also in touch with county officials, the AJC reported. "We'll be ready for whatever comes. Hopefully it won't be much, but if it, is we'll be ready to respond to it," Kemp said Wednesday.
Public Health said that if necessary, it may recommend community mitigation measures for affected Georgia communities, such as temporary closure of child care facilities and schools, and postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings.
Businesses should consider strategies to reduce the impact of a potential COVID-19 outbreak on their workforce, including teleworking and cross-training employees on essential job functions, Public Health said.
Meanwhile, Emory University said that a nonprofit biotechnology company owned by the university launched a GoFundMe charity campaign Thursday to help accelerate testing for its antiviral compound that could potentially be used to treat the new coronavirus.
While a related treatment, administered via injection, is being evaluated for COVID-19 in China, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory's approach is focused on an oral pill. Having an effective treatment for COVID-19 in pill form would allow the treatment to be more easily distributed to patients around the globe, which is a vital component in ending the epidemic, Emory said.

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, "they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump re-elected." The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Mr. Trump's re-election. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Mr. Trump? That would be the self-described democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders.
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) The New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Mr. Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it's out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian "collusion" narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how they supposedly intend to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Mr. Putin's press secretary told Russian state-run media, "This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth."
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year's election should Mr. Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach, not only his 2016 election, but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy. That's why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn't recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America's "faults" have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Mr. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush's administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the deaths of many in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like a setup and an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup poll shows record high approval (49 percent) of the president's policies. Forty-three percent of Independents polled now support the president - the highest percentage during Mr. Trump's entire presidency. We'll see if that translates into Republican victories in races for the Senate and House.
According to Gallup, "The latest survey finds a further increase in national satisfaction, with 45 percent now satisfied, the highest since February 2005."
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall "The Gingrich who stole Christmas" line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s. Democrats have also demagogued Republicans for not helping the poor and for being racist. That is a harder sell with the African-American unemployment rate at record lows and wages rising for virtually all groups. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty level is as low as its been in 11 years.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up -- to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's visit to India included a state dinner, tens of thousands of cheering onlookers and even a marching band on camels -- but a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India was notably absent.
For the second time since September, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the United States, the two countries have failed to reach even a limited "mini-deal" that would increase trade for focused groups of goods, like dairy products, medical devices and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Negotiators from both countries have been working since 2018 on a deal that would lower Indian barriers to some American products, and restore India's access to a program that allows goods to enter the United States tariff-free.
But the breakdown in negotiations illustrates the steep challenge in reaching a trade deal between two countries headed by populist leaders who harbor suspicions of multilateral arrangements. Both Trump and Modi want to protect jobs in their own countries by fending off foreign competitors -- shared attributes that make it even more difficult to strike a comprehensive agreement that would roll back trade barriers more broadly.
"Both sides are attuned to their own political imperatives and not where the other side might have an area of accommodation," said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S. India Business Council, who served as assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asia during the Obama administration. "It is hard, then, to find where the common ground is where a deal could be struck."
In appearances alongside Modi on Tuesday, Trump touted an agreement by India to purchase more than $3 billion of U.S. military equipment, as well as other purchasing agreements related to commercial airlines and natural gas.
But urgency toward a deal appears to have faded, with both leaders appearing content for trade barriers to continue. Trump has said he is focused on a larger agreement that could be reached at the end of this year, if the two sides can find common ground.
That may not be easy. During his visit, the president reiterated his previous complaints about India's high tariffs on American products, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other goods.
"We're being charged large amounts of tariffs, and you can't do that," Trump said. "I just said that's unfair, and we're working it out."
Since trade talks began, both the United States and India have escalated tensions by ratcheting up tariffs and trade barriers, rather than lowering them.
In March 2018, Trump included India in the list of countries that would be hit by his steel and aluminum tariffs. India responded with retaliatory tariffs on American almonds, apples and other goods. Last May, the Trump administration stripped India of a special status that exempted billions of dollars of its exports into the United States from tariffs.

Texto completo: When the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness issued its terrorism threat assessment for 2020 last week, it noted a marked shift.
The threat level from violent, homegrown extremists, and specifically white supremacists, was marked in red as the top category: "High." The threat from the Islamic State group, al-Qaida and their ilk was demoted to third, in green: "Low."
Terrorism experts believe that holds true for the entire United States.
"In the U.S., more people are killed by far-right extremists than by those who are adherents to Islamist extremism," said Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and a former senior Justice Department official for national security. Her comments came at a discussion last week at the September 11 Memorial & Museum, which commemorates victims of the most notorious attack by international terrorists on U.S. soil.
Even as the menace from homegrown extremists grows more explicit, however, law enforcement is wrestling with how to combat it. That challenge has spawned a fervent debate over whether the United States needs a new law to specifically criminalize domestic terrorism, or whether such a statute would threaten basic First Amendment rights.
Proponents argue that a domestic terrorism law would streamline and clarify the patchwork of charges now used against homegrown extremists, charges that often avoid even mentioning terrorism.
Opponents counter that a new law amounts to a worrisome expansion of government powers and might face constitutional challenges on the grounds of impinging on free speech.
Yet the New Jersey report laid out what is at stake in stark terms. "Some white supremacist extremists argue that participating in mass attacks or creating other forms of chaos will accelerate the imminent and necessary collapse of society in order to build a racially pure nation," it said.
After Latino shoppers were targeted in a shooting in August in El Paso, Texas, leaving 22 people dead, Congress proposed a new wave of laws.
However, most of those have stalled.
But the recent arrests of eight members of a white supremacist group called the Base, some of whose members were accused of planning a mass attack in Richmond, Virginia, have renewed focus on the issue. Three members arrested in Maryland pleaded not guilty last week to various charges, including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony.
Senior law enforcement officials express frustration that cases such as those cannot be called terrorism in court.
"The statutes that are typically deployed in connection with domestic terrorism cases are really kind of pedestrian in nature," said Thomas E. Brzozowski, the Justice Department's counsel for domestic terrorism.
"This confuses people. It leads to this pervasive but false narrative that somehow the government is paying more attention to the Islamic extremist threat than to the domestic threat," Brzozowski said.
With Democrats and Republicans proposing legislation, the issue is one of the few that does not divide strictly along partisan lines.
There is no legal mechanism for designating domestic extremist groups as terrorists. Federal laws define terrorism as a criminal attack intended to intimidate and coerce civilians in order to influence government policy or to otherwise affect government conduct.
The laws also define 57 specific acts as federal crimes of terrorism. Among the conditions required for formally labeling a crime terrorism in court are targeting an international airport, using a weapon of mass destruction or attacking federal officials.
Such charges come into play periodically. Using a weapon of mass destruction was among the accusations faced by Glendon Scott Crawford, a member of the Ku Klux Klan from upstate New York who failed in his attempt to build a radiation death ray that would inflict cancer on Muslims hit from afar. In 2016, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
However, current terrorism statutes do not incorporate most attacks on civilians that involve guns or vehicles, or the stockpiling of assault weapons, which McCord, the Georgetown law professor, said was a gaping hole considering their frequency. A new law also would underscore that society considers white supremacist violence on par with jihadism, she said.
Several draft bills seek to define domestic terrorism as a crime and to prescribe court sentences, including the death penalty. A less sweeping bill would force the federal government to make public statistics about all violence attributed to white supremacy.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee this month that the agency had more than 1,000 violent extremist investigations in progress, covering all 50 states, but he resisted providing a more detailed breakdown.
He described "racially motivated violent extremism" as a "national threat priority" equal to the threat from the Islamic State. The FBI also has created the Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell to buttress its efforts, he said, stressing that the focus is "not about the ideology, it's about the violence."
Misgivings about a new law also are bipartisan.
African American and Muslim organizations harbor deep concerns that a new law could actually be used against minority groups -- organizations protesting police violence, for example -- even though their communities are among the most frequently targeted. Current hate crime laws are powerful enough to prosecute these acts, said Nadia Aziz, the policy counsel for the Stop Hate Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
"We need to know how domestic terrorism investigations are being carried out right now instead of a new statute," said Aziz, echoing a common criticism.
A sweeping new law also makes some conservatives uneasy. The lack of such a law has not hindered the prosecution of anyone who carried out terrorist attacks domestically, said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in technology, privacy and civil liberties.
He pointed out that one domestic terrorism law proposed by a Republican congressman specified various prison sentences, including up to 25 years for destroying or damaging "any structure, conveyance or other real property."
That means a protester who engaged in vandalism to make a political point could face 25 years in jail.
"Beyond being unnecessary, it seems quite thorny and dangerous," Sanchez said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's visit to India included a state dinner, tens of thousands of cheering onlookers and even a marching band on camels - but a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India was notably absent.
For the second time since September, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the United States, the two countries have failed to reach even a limited "mini-deal" that would increase trade for focused groups of goods, like dairy products, medical devices and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Negotiators from both countries have been working since 2018 on a deal that would lower Indian barriers to some American products, and restore India's access to a program that allows goods to enter the United States tariff-free.
But the breakdown in negotiations illustrates the steep challenge in reaching a trade deal between two countries headed by populist leaders who harbor suspicions of multilateral arrangements. Both Trump and Modi want to protect jobs in their own countries by fending off foreign competitors - shared attributes that make it even more difficult to strike a comprehensive agreement that would roll back trade barriers more broadly.
"Both sides are attuned to their own political imperatives and not where the other side might have an area of accommodation," said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S. India Business Council, who served as assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asia during the Obama administration. "It is hard, then, to find where the common ground is where a deal could be struck."
In appearances alongside Modi on Tuesday, Trump touted an agreement by India to purchase more than $3 billion of U.S. military equipment, as well as other purchasing agreements related to commercial airlines and natural gas.
But urgency toward a deal appears to have faded, with both leaders appearing content for trade barriers to continue. Trump has said he is focused on a larger agreement that could be reached at the end of this year, if the two sides can find common ground.
That may not be easy. During his visit, the president reiterated his previous complaints about India's high tariffs on American products, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other goods.
"We're being charged large amounts of tariffs, and you can't do that," Trump said. "I just said that's unfair, and we're working it out."
Since trade talks began, both the United States and India have escalated tensions by ratcheting up tariffs and trade barriers, rather than lowering them.

Texto completo: MARGATE CITY, N.J. - A beloved rebel from a bygone era, she stands as a six-story testament to New Jersey's brawny brand of seaside kitsch.
Her calendar age is 138, but she wears it well. She has survived hurricanes, mild rot and brushes with fame.
Lucy the Elephant, a national landmark built in 1881 in Margate, a seaside city about 5 miles south of Atlantic City and about 125 miles from Allentown, is the last of three hulking pachyderms that once stood along the East Coast.
"The oldest surviving example of zoomorphic architecture on Earth," boasted her human handler and lifelong cheerleader, Richard Helfant.
And she is about to be the object of a publicity stunt befitting her colossal size and in service of her original mission: attracting visitors to the Jersey Shore.
Lucy has been listed on Airbnb. Starting on St. Patrick's Day. For $138 a night.
"Guests will be transported back in time with a stay inside Lucy the Elephant, one of the last standing pieces of roadside Americana," Airbnb said in a statement released Thursday.
Helfant holds a key to her cavernous heart, opening the door in her left hind foot for daily tours during summers and on weekends in the offseason.
Each year, about 132,000 paying visitors climb a narrow spiral staircase into the belly of the beast. Some continue up the side stairs to Lucy's ornate howdah, which is perched atop the 65-foot-tall elephant and offers stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic City skyline.
"If you could see the faces of the little kids," said Helfant, who has served for 21 years as executive director of a nonprofit responsible for operating and maintaining Lucy. " 'Is she real?' they ask. 'Can I touch her? What do you feed it?' "
When Lucy hosts overnight guests, it will actually not be the first time the giant elephant has been inhabited by humans, though it's been a while.
During one quirky chapter of her storied past, a family of six rented Lucy as their home in 1902. They constructed a second floor within the elephant's wooden frame, and installed a kitchen and a parlor, according to Jeremy Bingaman, Lucy the Elephant's educational director. A bathroom was built in the cove of her right shoulder.
The second floor has been removed, and Lucy has no running water, but a white claw-foot tub remains in the tiny bathroom.
Lucy will be available to rent from Helfant, the Airbnb host, on three days next month, for two guests a night. A staff member and a security guard will be on hand in the nearby gift shop. And a mobile trailer will be positioned at Lucy's feet to satisfy guests' toiletry needs.
For now, it's a three-day offering, but Helfant said he was open to an extended run.
"When you work for a 90-ton, 138-year-old elephant, nothing is off the table," he said.
The $138 rental price is a nod to Lucy's age. Helfant said the main goal was not rental income, but the power of Airbnb's global advertising.
He said he hoped the novelty would help to increase awareness of Lucy outside the immediate region, and would draw new customers to offset Lucy's considerable insurance and operating expenses.
In exchange for bragging rights to the only elephant lodging in the nation, Airbnb outfitted Lucy with Victorian furnishings and made a contribution to the Save Lucy Committee. Neither Airbnb nor Helfant would disclose the amount.
"It's sizable," he said. "It's extremely generous."
Guests will sleep in a red-draped canopy bed, and will get a gift card to dine in an area restaurant. Breakfast will be delivered, and can be eaten at a table positioned on a landing just below Lucy's circular eyes, which glow blue at night in honor of Ol' Blue Eyes - Frank Sinatra, a native of Hoboken, New Jersey.
Legend has it that the lights in Lucy's eyes once served as a signal for rum runners navigating the ocean during Prohibition. They would be lit green if it was safe to come ashore, and red if it wasn't, said Ryan Brown, who sometimes works in Lucy's well-stocked gift shop.
She has been repeatedly struck by lighting, was briefly condemned after falling into disrepair and was moved - twice. Famous visitors have included former President Woodrow Wilson, Henry Ford and a sultan of Brunei. In 1976, she was designated a national landmark subject to federal rules and regulation.
"I got yelled at when I painted her toenails," Helfant said.
Lucy was built by James V. Lafferty of Philadelphia to lure buyers to what was, in the late 1880s, a largely undeveloped tract of land.
He held a patent on the design, Bingaman, the educational director, said, and it was used to construct Lucy's even more mammoth cousin, the 12-story Elephantine Colossus in Coney Island in New York, which operated as a hotel. The Light of Asia in Cape May, New Jersey, was a distant relative, but was not built by Lafferty.
While Lucy got her start as a real estate office, she became a tavern in the early 20th century that was operated by her second owner, Sophia Gertzen.
Airbnb is known for offering novelty lodging opportunities, like a night in a Goodyear blimp, though Lucy will be one of Airbnb's most offbeat listings ever, according to a spokeswoman, Liz DeBold Fusco. She said searches for unique lodging - for example, a UFO-shaped pod, a covered wagon or an Idaho potato - increased by 70% over the past year.
The mayor of Margate, Michael Becker, said the city owed a debt to Lucy.
"Lucy is Margate's favorite animal by far," Becker said. "Whatever we can do to get some fame for Lucy and the city of Margate is good, as far as I'm concerned."
"Not many towns have an elephant," he added.

As an Airbnb, Lucy the Elephant is filled with amenities.

Tech moving travelers along AI trending among airports to efficiently process passengers

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up - to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Texto completo: Saturday is Feb. 29. That is a duh-dull sentence, until you realize it hasn't been written since 1992, the most recent instance of Leap Day falling on a Saturday.
Leap Day is an accounting adjustment, to square the Gregorian calendar with the orbital mechanics of the Earth's passage around the sun. But depending on how you think of space and time, it's a gift of an extra day in life. By a quirk in the science of these things, 2020 also will include a leap second, making it one of the longest years in your existence.
But how to spend this extra Saturday? A few hours helping to repair humanity, of course. In my house, I am trying to drum up support for a day without phones and social media. And I do that knowing Miller Lite is giving away a 24-pack via a QR code posted Saturday on their Twitter and Instagram. And that it's also the day Krispy Kreme begins delivering fresh doughnuts via DoorDash.
Here are some other ways to make use of your time on Saturday and beyond:
The Truman show
American Social in downtown Fort Lauderdale on Saturday will revive its homage to the legendary 1966 Black and White Ball ("the Best Party Ever," said the New York Times) thrown by Truman Capote, who somehow succeeded in making this celebrity hothouse a cell phone-free zone. In hosting "a party so big it can only be thrown once every four years," AmSo wants you in formalish black and/or white attire (tip: some in Capote's crowd wore masks), and in return there will be free champagne from 9 to 11 p.m. Visit AmericanSocialBar.com.
Come as you are
Speaking of period dress, the Battle of the Decades party at Elizabeth Ave. Station in West Palm Beach 7 p.m. Saturday will feature bands covering music from the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s and the '00s, and they hope you come dressed as your favorite decade. Admission is $10, and includes unlimited beer and wine. Kids 12 and younger get in free. Visit TheStationWPB.com.
Walking the dog
From the Of Course! Dept. comes the Fort Lauderdale Bark Walk, a dog-friendly art walk hosted by Rank & File Social Club in Fort Lauderdale's Flagler Village 6 p.m. Saturday. Coinciding with the monthly downtown Art Walk that takes over the nearby MASS District and FAT Village, the Bark Walk will combine displays from local artists with dog-oriented vendors. Visit Facebook.com/RankAndFileSC.
In a related note, you can get an early start on Saturday at 2 p.m. with the dog-centric Bark & Brews, hosted by Wonder Paws Rescue at Fort Lauderdale's Gulf Stream Brewing Co. Visit Facebook.com/GulfStreamBrewing.
Leap beers
Beginning at noon Saturday, Due South Brewing in Boynton Beach will celebrate Leap Day with tappings of four variations on its fan-favorite Mariana Trench Imperial Stout, including Vintage 2016, Coconut, Mexicana and Chocolate Peppermint Mariana Trench Imperial Stout. Visit Facebook.com/DueSouthBrewing.
Bangin' Banjo Brewing Co. in Pompano Beach will celebrate at noon Saturday by offering a free pint to anyone born on Feb. 29, which will force me to ask my son where he gets his fake IDs these days. Visit Facebook.com/BanginBanjoBrewing.
OK, not just beer, but Broski Ciderworks in Pompano Beach will celebrate its third anniversary 1 p.m. Saturday with a lineup of 30 of its most popular ciders, including five that have won awards at the two most recent U.S. Cider Open Championships. The party will include craft beers, food trucks (Kaminari Ramen and Tony Waffles), games and more. Visit BroskiCiderworks.com.

Mary Karlzen is back
Singer-songwriter Mary Karlzen's early '90s work with Miami label Y&T led to a critically lauded Atlantic Records album, "Yelling at Mary," music videos in regular rotation on VH1, CMT and the Nashville Network and performances on bills with Bob Dylan, John Hiatt, Jackson Browne, Nanci Griffith and others. Karlzen is working on her first studio album since 2007's "The Wanderlust Diaries" and will share new songs in an intimate show 7-11 p.m. Sunday at the House, a nonprofit creative space and café in North Miami Beach. Other expected performers include Jansen Press, Jolynn Daniel, Mitch Mestel, Mike Vullo, Matthew Sabatella and Jim Wurster. To RSVP, email ytmusic1@aol.com. Visit Facebook.com/121TheMuse.
Kindred spirit Karen Feldner will be joined by Sabatella and Mr. Entertainment and the Pookiesmackers at the organic café Zen Mystery in Dania Beach on Saturday at 8 p.m. when she will perform music from her "Winter" collection. Perfect timing. Visit ZenMystery.com
A shot of Brandi
While I'm thinking of it, just a reminder that extraordinary singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile ("The Joke," "The Eye") plays Hard Rock Live in Hollywood on March 6, a thoughtful booking in this flashy new venue that needs to be encouraged. Tickets can still be had, beginning at $21.50. Visit Ticketmaster.com.
Date night
Friday brings the final edition of the free Lake Worth Bonfire series on the sand adjacent to the Lake Worth Casino Building and Beach Complex, with music by the People Upstairs and blanket and cooler by you. Bring two blankets or three dogs, with temperatures on Friday night possibly getting into the 40s. The event runs from 6 to 10 p.m. Visit Facebook.com/LakeWorthCasino.

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up - to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Texto completo: The mystery of Linda Eder will be presented Saturday night when she sings at The American Theater in Hampton.
The audience will hear the marvel whom the New York Times and the rest of the swells called a "phenomenon" when she made her Broadway debut in "Jekyll & Hyde" in 1997. She was hailed as "the next Barbra Streisand," as well as the new everyone else.
Local folks can say they "discovered" Eder well before she got to New York. "Jekyll & Hyde" played Chrysler Hall a month before it opened on Broadway, and the range of the singer who played Lucy was noted in The Pilot's review. She had a three-octave range and could reach a high F.
A cult following formed quickly. She was hailed as "the next Judy Garland" in addition to Streisand - and she names both stars as major influences. Frank Wildhorn, who composed "Jekyll & Hyde," largely turned his career over to writing for her.
So why did she not become a household name?
She defied them all by deciding to be "the first" Linda Eder.
She didn't want to be the kind of industry machine that, as she puts it, "has to go further and further every time out." Rather, she sings when she wants and, otherwise, has a life.
She telephoned from her "horse farm" one hour's drive from New York City to talk as much about her escape as about her continued life as a singer.
"I built most of my own stable," she said, proudly. "I'm good with power tools."
Her two, 2-year-old horses, Charlie and Max, have identical personalities, she said.
"I do everything with the horses myself, or try. I clean the stables. I've become something of a control freak in that I want to do it all myself."
That also means managing the sale of the 18 albums she's made, foregoing outside deals.
She's driving down to Hampton Roads for her night at The American Theater. She's choosing the songs, and she's expected to belt them out. It's required.
"I hope never to do eight shows a week again as I did on Broadway," she said. "It kills the voice. That's what happened with Whitney Houston and a lot of others. You can ruin the voice."
In Minneapolis where she grew up, "they wanted me to sing like I was an opera singer when I was 10, and I could do it. But now that I'm older, I can also do the lower moments, too. Back then, I never could do the low tones. I guess you would call me a mezzo-soprano."
"But," she added, "I never was a child. I think of myself as perennially 35, or around that. I had some minor talent at the piano, but the piano got left behind once when we moved. I bought myself a cheap guitar to have an accompanying instrument. I wasn't good at it.
That left singing.
"Back then, anyone who could look fairly decent in a sparkling dress and carry a tune could work," she said. "When I got to New York, the critics weren't always kind. They either went wild over me or they were hesitant. I knew that they were holding back because maybe I thought I was the great new thing. I wasn't thinking at all. I just sang."
Things changed for her when she auditioned for composer Frank Wildhorn, who wrote "Jekyll & Hyde." She also sang for his musicals "Svengali," "Wonderland: Alice's New Musical Adventure," "Cyrano de Bergerac," "Camille Claudel," "Bonnie & Clyde" and "The Civil War."
To some, it appeared that he would be to her career what David O. Selznick was to Jennifer Jones in Hollywood legend. But she became bigger than his shows. They were married for six years and remain good friends today. Their son, Jake, 20, is evolving as a composer and performer.
She limits herself to one or two concerts a month, and heads back home to check on the horses and "live."
She comes out to meet the audience after every performance. She did it at the stage door of her Broadway shows, too. "It's a part of being there," she said.
She remembers the moment when she realized that she didn't want to become a superstar.
"It was a moment on 46th Street in New York when I had, just had, to get to the airport, and the street was blocked by fans. My fans. There was a wild scene. Pushing and shoving. Now, I know I couldn't have met all those people anyway, but it had an effect on me. I felt guilty about pushing them aside. I didn't want that kind of thing. I didn't want to be that kind of machine."
If anyone regrets that Eder did not become one of the biggest singing stars of her generation, she is not one of them. She is her own kind of legend.

Texto completo: Atari. Magnavox. Intellivision.
Each evokes memories of the golden age of video games, which brought the first wave of consoles you could connect to your home television.
But there's an oft-forgotten person from that era whose contributions to the industry still resonate today: a black engineer named Jerry Lawson.
Lawson oversaw the creation of the Channel F, the first video game console with interchangeable game cartridges – something the first Atari and Magnavox Odyssey systems did not use.
Those initial consoles had a selection of games hardwired into the console itself. (The Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972, also used game "cards," that were printed circuit boards, but did not contain game data as the subsequent cartridges did.)
But Lawson, an engineer and designer at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., led a team at the Silicon Valley semiconductor maker charged with creating a game system using Fairchild's F8 microprocessor and storing games on cartridges.
"A lot of people in the industry swore that a microprocessor couldn't be used in video games and I knew better," Lawson said during a speech at the 2005 Classic Gaming Expo in San Francisco posted on YouTube.
The Fairchild Video Entertainment System, later named the Channel F (for "Fun"), which began selling in 1976, had games such as hockey, tennis, blackjack and a maze game that foreshadowed Pac-Man.
Before Atari, there was Channel F
The console beat the Atari 2600 to market by one year. But Atari's name recognition and marketing heft basically pushed the Channel F into video game history obscurity. The system would sell about 250,000 units while the Atari 2600, which would get hits such as "Space Invaders" and "Asteroids," would go on to sell about 30 million units.
Regardless, the Channel F established the concept of a console that could play an unlimited number of games, the foundation for today's global video game market, which is projected to surpass $160 billion in 2020, according to research firm Newzoo.
Lawson, who died in 2011 at the age of 70 due to complications of diabetes, "literally created an industry that is bigger than the movie industry," said John William Templeton, executive producer of curriculum and content for ReUNION: Education-Arts-Heritage, which creates programming for schools.
How Lawson got into games
A groundbreaker as one of the few African American engineers in the industry at the time, Lawson grew up in Queens, New York. He was a lifelong inventor who attended college but did not earn a college degree, according to his obituary in The New York Times. As a teen, he made money by repairing televisions.
After he moved to the Bay Area and was working at Fairchild, Lawson belonged to a home inventors club that included Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak; the pair would go on to found Apple. Lawson also built his own coin-operated arcade game called "Demolition Derby" in his garage, which led the company to ask him to focus on games, according to an interview in 2009 with Vintage Computing and Gaming.
When he left Fairchild, Lawson founded his own video game company, Videosoft, which created games for the Atari 2600 and made some of the first 3D games. But he closed the company during the video game crash of the mid-1980s.
Lawson got some recognition before he died.
He was included in the 2009 documentary, "Freedom Riders of the Cutting Edge," produced by Templeton, who was editor of the San Jose Business Journal from 1987 to 1989.
Soon after that, Templeton mentioned Lawson to Joseph Saulter, chairman of the International Game Developers Association's diversity advisory board. "I just said to him, 'Well, you know the person who did the first video game console was black.' He just literally stopped in his tracks," Templeton said. "I just interviewed him I can bring him over and have him speak to folks."
As a result, Lawson was invited to a Blacks in Gaming gathering at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2011.
"The most important part of it was that there were maybe 70 or so black developers there listening to him," Templeton said.
"It was just extremely emotional for them because for their entire lives, their professional lives, they had been feeling like outsiders and, then they (could say), 'Hey, wait a minute, somebody who looks like me started the whole thing'."
Gordon Bellamy, who at the time was the IGDA's executive director, recalled how the event helped younger African Americans working in video games embrace "our reality, to learn and value and celebrate the very history of how our careers were built on (Lawson's legacy)," he said.
In the early '90s, Bellamy was one of the few African Americans working in video games and he rose to become a lead designer on Electronic Arts' John Madden Football franchise. "We are a continuation of a history," said Bellamy, who seven years later got an IGDA lifetime achievement award named after Lawson.
Meeting Lawson, he said, "was great and obviously for me resonant. I think for him it was his first time seeing his legacy live on not only in the recognition of his work but in all of us existing in the craft."
"As I reflect on it, I was an engineer myself coming out of school," said Bellamy, who is a visiting scholar at the University of Southern California and president of Gay Gaming Professionals. "I am just so thankful for his contributions that afforded me my career."
His place in video game history
An exhibit of Lawson's handiwork is on permanent display at The World Video Game Hall of Fame at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. There, you can see the Channel F game system and some of Videosoft's games. The museum has Lawson's papers in its archive, too. Lawson and the Channel F game system also are included in "A History of Video Games in 64 Objects," a book published by the museum in 2018.
Among the museum's missions: bringing to light the contributions of minorities and women in the video game industry. Lawson's contributions counter a lack of representation of black game developers in the industry, said Jeremy Saucier, an assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games at the museum.
"The major figures often tend to be white men," Saucier said. "We really want to get the history right and tell a more inclusive history than the meta-narrative that we have stuck with in the past."
The creation of the Channel F system by Lawson's team at Fairchild was "an achievement (that) ends up completely changing what was at the time a really burgeoning video game industry," he said. "It laid that groundwork for the business model of the industry, the razor blade model, of (putting) a console in the hand of consumers for a low profit or loss and make much higher profits on all these individual games."
Violence in today's video games
As he aged, Lawson became upset with how video games glorified violence. "Most of the games that are out now – I'm appalled by them," he told Vintage Computing and Gaming. "They're all scenario games considered with shooting somebody and killing somebody. To me, a game should be something like a skill you should develop – if you play this game, you walk away with something of value. That's what a game is to me."
Lawson's story is told almost daily still. Templeton co-produced (with William Hammons II) another documentary, "A Great Day in Gaming: the Gerald Anderson Lawson Story" in 2011 and it is shown in schools that participate in the ReUNION network.
As he works with children in Brooklyn and Queens, Templeton says he often evokes Lawson's career, "as an example of how they can be creators and not just consumers."

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up - to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, a university and a church.
The charges, announced Wednesday in Virginia and Washington state, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group.
In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as "swatting" - calling police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing authorities to respond in force.
In one instance, prosecutors said, Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen.
In other cases in 2018 and 2019, prosecutors said, Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University, Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and an unnamed Cabinet official who authorities said was under Secret Service protection. Last month, prosecutors said, Denton met with an undercover FBI agent and described his efforts.
"Denton said that if he was 'raided' for swatting ProPublica, then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime," Jonathan Myles Lund, an FBI agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Denton and others.
Authorities said Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University.
In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen's chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington, described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Florida; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Arizona.
Authorities said the quartet devised an operation called Erste Saule, or "first pillar" in German, which Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target "journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message."
The goal, Shea said, was to "erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act."
Prosecutors said Cole and Shea were the "primary organizers." When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Shea and Cole offered praise. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel "terrorized." Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges.
Authorities said Cole and Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets.
Raymond Duda, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Seattle, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement's radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and "hate camps." He said the FBI was continuing to investigate the group around the country.

Texto completo: When the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness issued its terrorism threat assessment for 2020 last week, it noted a marked shift.
The threat level from violent, homegrown extremists, and specifically white supremacists, was marked in red as the top category: "High." The threat from the Islamic State group, al-Qaida and their ilk was demoted to third, in green: "Low."
Terrorism experts believe that holds true for the entire United States.
"In the U.S., more people are killed by far-right extremists than by those who are adherents to Islamist extremism," said Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and a former senior Justice Department official for national security. Her comments came at a discussion last week at the September 11 Memorial & Museum, which commemorates victims of the most notorious attack by international terrorists on U.S. soil.
Even as the menace from homegrown extremists grows more explicit, however, law enforcement is wrestling with how to combat it. That challenge has spawned a fervent debate over whether the United States needs a new law to specifically criminalize domestic terrorism, or whether such a statute would threaten basic First Amendment rights.
Proponents argue that a domestic terrorism law would streamline and clarify the patchwork of charges now used against homegrown extremists, charges that often avoid even mentioning terrorism.
Opponents counter that a new law amounts to a worrisome expansion of government powers and might face constitutional challenges on the grounds of impinging on free speech.
Yet the New Jersey report laid out what is at stake in stark terms. "Some white supremacist extremists argue that participating in mass attacks or creating other forms of chaos will accelerate the imminent and necessary collapse of society in order to build a racially pure nation," it said.
After Latino shoppers were targeted in a shooting in August in El Paso, Texas, leaving 22 people dead, Congress proposed a new wave of laws.
However, most of those have stalled.
But the recent arrests of eight members of a white supremacist group called the Base, some of whose members were accused of planning a mass attack in Richmond, Virginia, have renewed focus on the issue. Three members arrested in Maryland pleaded not guilty last week to various charges, including transporting a firearm and ammunition with the intent to commit a felony.
Senior law enforcement officials express frustration that cases such as those cannot be called terrorism in court.
"The statutes that are typically deployed in connection with domestic terrorism cases are really kind of pedestrian in nature," said Thomas E. Brzozowski, the Justice Department's counsel for domestic terrorism.
"This confuses people. It leads to this pervasive but false narrative that somehow the government is paying more attention to the Islamic extremist threat than to the domestic threat," Brzozowski said.
With Democrats and Republicans proposing legislation, the issue is one of the few that does not divide strictly along partisan lines.
There is no legal mechanism for designating domestic extremist groups as terrorists. Federal laws define terrorism as a criminal attack intended to intimidate and coerce civilians in order to influence government policy or to otherwise affect government conduct.
The laws also define 57 specific acts as federal crimes of terrorism. Among the conditions required for formally labeling a crime terrorism in court are targeting an international airport, using a weapon of mass destruction or attacking federal officials.
Such charges come into play periodically. Using a weapon of mass destruction was among the accusations faced by Glendon Scott Crawford, a member of the Ku Klux Klan from upstate New York who failed in his attempt to build a radiation death ray that would inflict cancer on Muslims hit from afar. In 2016, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
However, current terrorism statutes do not incorporate most attacks on civilians that involve guns or vehicles, or the stockpiling of assault weapons, which McCord, the Georgetown law professor, said was a gaping hole considering their frequency. A new law also would underscore that society considers white supremacist violence on par with jihadism, she said.
Several draft bills seek to define domestic terrorism as a crime and to prescribe court sentences, including the death penalty. A less sweeping bill would force the federal government to make public statistics about all violence attributed to white supremacy.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Judiciary Committee this month that the agency had more than 1,000 violent extremist investigations in progress, covering all 50 states, but he resisted providing a more detailed breakdown.
He described "racially motivated violent extremism" as a "national threat priority" equal to the threat from the Islamic State. The FBI also has created the Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell to buttress its efforts, he said, stressing that the focus is "not about the ideology, it's about the violence."
Misgivings about a new law also are bipartisan.
African American and Muslim organizations harbor deep concerns that a new law could actually be used against minority groups - organizations protesting police violence, for example - even though their communities are among the most frequently targeted. Current hate crime laws are powerful enough to prosecute these acts, said Nadia Aziz, the policy counsel for the Stop Hate Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
"We need to know how domestic terrorism investigations are being carried out right now instead of a new statute," said Aziz, echoing a common criticism.
A sweeping new law also makes some conservatives uneasy. The lack of such a law has not hindered the prosecution of anyone who carried out terrorist attacks domestically, said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who specializes in technology, privacy and civil liberties.
He pointed out that one domestic terrorism law proposed by a Republican congressman specified various prison sentences, including up to 25 years for destroying or damaging "any structure, conveyance or other real property."
That means a protester who engaged in vandalism to make a political point could face 25 years in jail.
"Beyond being unnecessary, it seems quite thorny and dangerous," Sanchez said.

Texto completo: I'm the quintessential moderate Democrat. I volunteered for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The temperate Barack Obama of the 2012 election excited me far more than the inspirational Barack Obama of the 2008 election. I may think "Medicare for All" is good policy, but I also think it's a pipe dream and an unnecessary purity test. I think low-hanging fruit is a positive description, not a negative one.
I also have doubts about Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. His grasp of policy -- even policies, like breaking up big banks, which he has talked about for decades -- has been shaky. Some of his plans miss the mark. Canceling student loan debt, for instance, is a redistribution to the upper-middle class. The math behind how to pay for his ambitious proposals is, at best, optimistic.
I don't want Sen. Sanders to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Yet if he is, he will have my vigorous, unambiguous support. I will donate, I will volunteer, and I will vote.
My fellow moderates must make the same promise. America will be better off under a "President Sanders."
The first reason is the most obvious -- if Sen. Sanders is the nominee, the only alternative is President Donald Trump. There will be no third-party savior. Wisely or not, our system is set up for two-candidate elections. The last serious third-party candidate, Ross Perot, received roughly 20% of the popular vote in 1992. He received zero electoral votes.
If Sen. Sanders is the only realistic alternative to President Trump, then, we have to compare him with President Trump. Despite the grumbling, Sanders is a far better option.
An existential threat
Consider the most egregious sins of the Trump administration -- family separation, support for white nationalists, siding with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community, disregard for the rule of law, attempts to undermine future elections, and giving powerful positions to people who are incompetent, immoral or both. Let alone the administration's half-baked proposals to get rid of birthright citizenship or build a wall that blows over when it's windy.
These are the sorts of sins that undermine American democracy itself, that are an existential threat to America as we know it. Sen. Sanders -- like any Democrat -- would put an end to all of them immediately. White nationalists would go back to their caves and Central American children would be released from their cages; Putin would lose all sway over the White House; Betsy DeVos would no longer be a Cabinet-level secretary.
A President Sanders could also begin to rebalance a judiciary that has moved far to the right during the Trump administration. We need to protect not only the Supreme Court -- though liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg (age 86) and Stephen Breyer (age 81) are closer to the end of their terms than the beginning -- but also circuit courts and district courts, where President Trump has placed 50 and 133 judges, respectively. With another four years, conservatives would have an unbreakable judicial majority for a generation. Moderates understand the importance of incremental change, and progressive judges are critical to that process.
Further, a President Sanders would expand -- rather than curtail -- civil rights. The past four years have seen expanded use of "voter ID" laws, an attempt to suppress minority response to the census through a "citizenship question," a curtailing of legal immigration and a travel ban targeting Muslims, not to mention the effective end of the Voting Rights Act.
When people cannot vote
Moderates believe that the best change happens in the voting booth, rather than by executive fiat. When people cannot vote, however, that ceases to be the case.
Finally, our political system would likely curtail a President Sanders' most far-reaching impulses. As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman argues, the public -- let alone the Senate -- wouldn't go along with Medicare for All, massive deficit-funded spending increases, large cuts to military spending or total student loan forgiveness.
Yes, there are policy areas where President Sanders would have wide latitude -- mostly regulatory enforcement of financial and environmental standards -- but that would be little more than a corrective to a Trump administration that has all but ended regulatory enforcement.
We moderates pride ourselves on realism and incrementalism. We understand that a 50% solution -- or even a 10% solution -- is better than no solution at all. We are not ideologues. We pursue the best available options, not the best options we can dream up.
Now is not the time for us moderates to become our own form of ideologues. We need to be more realist than ever before. If we are worried about electability, we should by all means work to nominate another Democrat.
Yet if he is the nominee, we need to support Bernie Sanders with every ounce of fight we have within us.

Texto completo: New Jersey chefs earned seven spots on the semi-finalist list for the The James Beard Foundation Awards, among the most prestigious culinary awards in the world.
The nominees include Marciel Presilla of Cucharamama in Hoboken (a 2012 winner of Best Chef-Mid Atlantic and 2013 winner of Cookbook of the Year), Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood (this will be his ninth nomination), five-time nominee Dan Richer of Razza in Jersey City, Cookie Till of Steve and Cookie's in Margate, Robbie Felice of Viaggio Ristorante in Wayne, Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer of Canal House Station in Milford, as well as the restaurant 15 Fox Place in Jersey City.
The final round of nominees will be announced in Philadelphia on March 25 and the awards gala will take place on May 4 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.
Since the awards began in 1991, only two New Jersey chefs have received a James Beard award. Craig Shelton, then at The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, and Maricel Presilla, chef at Cucharamama in Hoboken, both won best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. Shelton in 2000; Presilla in 2012.
Joey Baldino, Zeppoli, Collingswood Chef Joey Baldino, owner of Zeppoli, a Sicilian-influenced BYOB in Collingswood, has received his ninth James Beard nomination. It's the eighth time he's gotten the nod as Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic Region, nominated every year he's qualified. Zeppoli also got a Best New Restaurant in 2012.
Prior to opening Zeppoli, Baldino worked with top chefs Georges Perrier, Michael Solomonov, Jose Garces, and Alice Waters early in his career. A graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York City, Baldino also owns Palizzi Social Club, a private dining club in South Philadelphia, which Bon Appetit named the fourth-best restaurant in the country in 2017.
Last fall, Baldino released his first cookbook, "Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club," written with long-time Courier-Post restaurant critic Adam Erace of Philadelphia. Before Christmas, Baldino cooked a traditional Feast of the Seven Fishes at the James Beard House in Manhattan.
Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama, Hoboken Maricel Presilla is a decorated chef and owner of Cucharamama and Zafra in Hoboken. A Latin and Caribbean cuisine expert, Presilla was named the James Beard Award's Best Chef-Mid Atlantic region in 2012, won the Foundation's Cookbook of the Year for "Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America" in 2013 and was inducted into its Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America in 2015. Her vibrant Latin restaurant Cucharamama has garnered her a 2020 nomination for Outstanding Chef, a national award.
Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer, Canal House Station, Milford It may only be Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer's first year owning and operating Canal House Station in Milford, a seasonal yet unfussy American restaurant that opened its doors last summer — but they're certainly no strangers to the culinary world.
The joint owners of Canal House, a publishing venture and culinary, photography and design studio known for their nationally recognized, seasonal cookbooks, "Canal House Cooking," have a storied history in the food world.
Hirsheimer is co-founder and former executive editor of Saveur, a gourmet, food, wine and travel magazine known for its essays about enduring culinary traditions. Throughout the magazine's 25-year-history, it brought home 23 James Beard Journalism Awards.
She is also an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in more than 50 cookbooks for prominent food personalities such as Lidia Bastianich, Mario Batali and Julia Child.
Hamilton is the former test kitchen director and food editor of Saveur and has worked in the kitchens of Martha Stewart Living and Cook's Illustrated. She is also the co-founder and first executive chef of Hamilton's Grill Room in Lambertville.
Dan Richer, Razza, Jersey City Dan Richer opened his lauded BYOB pizza place Razza in 2012. Since then, folks from all over the state and beyond have flocked to Razza to try his Neapolitan-style wood-fired pizza. Razza received an impressive 3-star review from the New York Times.
Richer is an obsessive pizza maker, and has aced the creation of everything aspect of his pizza from the crust to the cheese on top. He has been nominated for Best Chef Mid-Atlantic.
15 Fox Place, Jersey City The homey 15 Fox Place in Jersey City was nominated for Outstanding Hospitality. This hidden gem is located in a 1905 home covered in vines on the outside and decorated with family photos on the inside. It's the childhood home of owner Marc Budinich. Dinner is served over a three-hour period with breaks built in so guests can mingle. There's no menu — guests simply sit in the cozy dining room and wait to be served their multi-course, Italian meal, just like at Nonna's house. The unique dining experience has made 15 Fox Place worthy of an Outstanding Hospitality.
Cookie Till, Steve & Cookie's and Ventnor No. 7311, Margate and Ventnor City Representing the South Jersey shore, Cookie Till, owner of Steve & Cookie's and Ventnor No. 7311, has been nominated for Outstanding Restaurateur. The bright and airy Steve & Cookie's is known for its upscale American and seafood-forward food. During the summer months, it's packed with locals and tourists alike – good luck getting a reservation. Her second restaurant, Ventnor No. 731, is a café and small batch bakery. This is where Till gets to flex her pastry skills, whipping up cookies, cakes, pies and loaves of bread.
Robbie Felice, Viaggio Ristorante in Wayne and Osteria Crescendo in Westwood In a telling sign of the food scene in the modern world, Felice found out about his Rising Star Chef nomination on — what else? — Instagram.
A friend messaged him a screen shot of the Beard web site with his name circled.
"I've been crying like a baby, running around, hugging all my line chefs," he said. "Everyone in the restaurant was screaming and jumping. It's been a morning, that's for sure."
Rising Star Chefs, according to the James Beard Foundation, "must be age 30 or younger and display an impressive talent, likely to make a significant impact on the industry for years to come." Felice is 29.
He started his career right after high school at the Culinary Institute of America, and his externship there was at Babbo in Manhattan. After graduation, he cooked at Highlawn Pavilion and The Manor, both in West Orange. He spent some time out west, in Vail, Colorado, and Las Vegas, where, at at B&B Ristorante, owned by Batali Bastianich Hospitality Group, he learned to cure his own meats. After a culinary sojourn to Europe, he came back to the states and cooked at The Modern in Manhattan and Fascino in Montclair.
He and his father, Joe Felice, opened Viaggio in 2016, and Felice quickly became known for his modern — and delicious — Italian food, which he cooks using locally sourced ingredients. (The bolognese is to die for, as is the calamari in a lemon-butter sauce. And yes, he still cures his own meats.) The Record awarded the restaurant 3 1/2 stars, the highest ever for a restaurant in Passaic County.
They opened Osteria Crescendo in 2019, and in her review, Esther Davidowitz swooned over the farfalle, the crudo, the chitarra, well, everything.
Davidowitz called Felicie a "culinary superstar." Now, it appears the restaurant awards judges at the James Beard Foundation think so too.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's visit to India included a state dinner, tens of thousands of cheering onlookers and even a marching band on camels - but a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India was notably absent.
For the second time since September, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the United States, the two countries have failed to reach even a limited "mini-deal" that would increase trade for focused groups of goods, like dairy products, medical devices and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Negotiators from both countries have been working since 2018 on a deal that would lower Indian barriers to some American products, and restore India's access to a program that allows goods to enter the United States tariff-free.
But the breakdown in negotiations illustrates the steep challenge in reaching a trade deal between two countries headed by populist leaders who harbor suspicions of multilateral arrangements. Both Trump and Modi want to protect jobs in their own countries by fending off foreign competitors - shared attributes that make it even more difficult to strike a comprehensive agreement that would roll back trade barriers more broadly.
"Both sides are attuned to their own political imperatives and not where the other side might have an area of accommodation," said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S. India Business Council, who served as assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asia during the Obama administration. "It is hard, then, to find where the common ground is where a deal could be struck."
In appearances alongside Modi on Tuesday, Trump touted an agreement by India to purchase more than $3 billion of U.S. military equipment, as well as other purchasing agreements related to commercial airlines and natural gas.
But urgency toward a deal appears to have faded, with both leaders appearing content for trade barriers to continue. Trump has said he is focused on a larger agreement that could be reached at the end of this year, if the two sides can find common ground.
That may not be easy. During his visit, the president reiterated his previous complaints about India's high tariffs on American products, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other goods.
"We're being charged large amounts of tariffs, and you can't do that," Trump said. "I just said that's unfair, and we're working it out."
Since trade talks began, both the United States and India have escalated tensions by ratcheting up tariffs and trade barriers, rather than lowering them.
In March 2018, Trump included India in the list of countries that would be hit by his steel and aluminum tariffs. India responded with retaliatory tariffs on American almonds, apples and other goods. Last May, the Trump administration stripped India of a special status that exempted billions of dollars of its exports into the United States from tariffs.

Breaking down Ben Affleck Actor speaks frankly about dealing with addiction and divorce and moving past shame

Texto completo: Ben Affleck, Oscar-winning writer, director of the Oscar-winning "Argo," better actor than you remember - and, yes, alcoholic divorcé - has four movies coming out this year.
Dad Bod Batman has been banished, and actual films are back on his docket, including his first all-on-him movie in four years: "The Way Back," a poignant sports drama that arrives in theaters March 6. Affleck plays a reluctant high school basketball coach with big problems - he's a puffy, willful, fall-down drunk who blows up his marriage and lands in rehab.
You read that correctly.
"People with compulsive behavior, and I am one, have this kind of basic discomfort all the time that they're trying to make go away," Affleck said. "You're trying to make yourself feel better with eating or drinking or sex or gambling or shopping or whatever. But that ends up making your life worse. Then you do more of it to make that discomfort go away. Then the real pain starts. It becomes a vicious cycle you can't break. That's at least what happened to me.
"I drank relatively normally for a long time. What happened was that I started drinking more and more when my marriage was falling apart. This was 2015, 2016. My drinking, of course, created more marital problems."
Affleck's marriage to Jennifer Garner, with whom he has three children, ended in 2018 after a long separation. He said he still felt guilt but had moved past shame.
"The biggest regret of my life is this divorce," he said. "Shame is really toxic. There is no positive byproduct of shame. It's just stewing in a toxic, hideous feeling of low self-worth and self-loathing.
"It's not particularly healthy for me to obsess over the failures - the relapses - and beat myself up," he said. "I have certainly made mistakes. I have certainly done things that I regret. But you've got to pick yourself up, learn from it, learn some more, try to move forward."
"The Way Back" was originally called "The Has-Been." That downer of a title was dropped during development as the film became less focused on what a basketball talent the main character had been in high school, Affleck said. Suffice it to say, no star wants to appear on a poster next to the words "The Has-Been," especially not after two box office disappointments. "Justice League" (2017) took in $658 million, a puny sum by superhero standards, and "Live by Night" (2016), a period gangster drama that he also directed, flatlined with $23 million.
Affleck, 47, has been working like a madman to get his career back on track. The hard truth is that the outcome is not guaranteed. Moviegoers, women in particular, will ultimately decide: Is forgiveness for transgressions still something that society in all of its Twitter-fied polarization allows? To some, Affleck is still the guy who broke Garner's heart and who was accused of groping a talk-show host in 2013. "I acted inappropriately," he said of that incident in 2017, as the #MeToo era dawned, "and I sincerely apologize."
Hollywood has certainly granted Affleck clemency. He just finished acting in "Deep Water," a psychological thriller co-starring Ana de Armas ("Knives Out") that's due in theaters in November. He's on Netflix this month in "The Last Thing He Wanted," an abysmally reviewed mystery anchored by Anne Hathaway and directed by Dee Rees. Affleck has also been working with the Oscar-nominated Nicole Holofcener and Matt Damon on the script for "The Last Duel," which begins filming in France this month. Set in the 14th century, "The Last Duel" re-teams Affleck and Damon as screenwriters for the first time since "Good Will Hunting" in 1997; Ridley Scott is directing.
Affleck has not talked much about his alcoholism since completing a third stint in rehab in 2018. (The first two were in 2001 and 2017.) But the arrival of "The Way Back" has made the subject impossible to avoid. Affleck has also accepted that the second word in Alcoholics Anonymous does not apply to him - certainly not after he (briefly) relapsed in the fall, turning up smashed on TMZ a few months after making it known that he had achieved one year of continuous sobriety.
"Relapse is embarrassing, obviously," he said. "I wish it didn't happen. I really wish it wasn't on the internet for my kids to see."
Growing up in Massachusetts, Affleck saw his own father drunk almost every day.
"My dad didn't really get sober until I was 19," Affleck said.
"The older I've gotten, the more I recognize that my dad did the best he could," he said. "There's a lot of alcoholism and mental illness in my family. The legacy of that is quite powerful and sometimes hard to shake."
Affleck's younger brother, Casey, 44, has spoken about his own alcoholism and sobriety. Their paternal grandmother took her own life in a motel when she was 46. An uncle killed himself with a shotgun. An aunt was a heroin addict.
"It took me a long time to fundamentally, deeply, without a hint of doubt, admit to myself that I am an alcoholic," Ben Affleck said. "The next drink will not be different."
It seemed like a good moment to point out how many stars had started to speak out about getting sober - Brad Pitt most notably - and how that was lessening the stigma of addiction and, perhaps, inspiring people with substance problems to seek help. Jamie Lee Curtis, sober for two decades, appeared on the cover of Variety's "recovery" issue in November. Discussing their sobriety in recent books and interviews have been Demi Lovato, Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Simpson, Demi Moore and, of course, Elton John, who has sponsored Eminem.
Affleck cited the sober A-listers Bradley Cooper and Robert Downey Jr. as "guys who have been very supportive and to whom I feel a great sense of gratitude."
"One of the things about recovery that I think people sometimes overlook is the fact that it inculcates certain values. Be honest. Be accountable. Help other people. Apologize when you're wrong."
Let's talk about honesty for a minute. Shouldn't he have been honest from the start about the back tattoo rather than telling "Extra" it was "fake" for a movie?
"I resented that somebody got a picture of it by spying on me," Affleck said, shifting on the sofa where he was sitting. "It felt invasive. But you're right. I could have said, 'That's none of your business.' I guess I got a kick out of messing with 'Extra.' Is your tattoo real or not real? Of course, it's real! No, I put a fake tattoo on my back and then hid it."
Affleck has a habit of putting himself in the crosshairs. He thought it was a good idea to star (with Damon) as a fallen angel in Kevin Smith's "Dogma" (1999), which Disney decided was too blasphemous for its Miramax label to release. Playing Batman as melancholy and middle-aged was certainly not the safe choice. "The Last Duel" has already provoked indignation on social media; Affleck and Damon play a knight and a squire who are forced to duel after a woman's rape accusation.
And now comes "The Way Back," a spare film with a 1970s vibe about a man imprisoned by alcoholism.
How exactly does he make these choices?
Affleck laughed. "I've never been very risk-averse - for better or worse, obviously," he said. "Regarding 'The Way Back,' the benefits, to me, far outweighed the risks. I found it very therapeutic."

Trump's 'Virus Week' hasn't provided any comfort OP-ED

Texto completo: So, our Coronavirus Czar is going to be ... Mike Pence. Feeling more secure?
"I know full well the importance of presidential leadership," the vice president said as soon as he was introduced in his new role.
Totally qualified. First criteria for every job in this administration is capacity for praising the gloriousness of our commander in chief. Yeah, when you think of Mike Pence you maybe don't think about Pandemic Fighter Supreme. But as President Donald Trump pointed out repeatedly, he has already run Indiana.
Well, it probably could have been worse. Having a czar does make you feel there's somebody in charge. At least Trump didn't come before the cameras and announce solemnly, "Today I'm asking every American to cross your fingers."
Our president had to be going crazy over a problem that involves both declining stock prices and germs. This is the guy, after all, who thinks shaking hands is "barbaric," who is followed around by aides bearing sanitizer.
Meanwhile, he's come up with a totally new explanation for the stock market skid. It turns out investors were not frightened so much by the pandemic as the Democratic debate.
"I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves," Trump told reporters.
Plus that virus thing is ... not necessarily a big deal. What really "shocked" him, Trump said, was his discovery that "the flu in our country kills 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year."
So the problems are the Democrats and the flu. The answers are Mike Pence and ... reminding the public once again that Nancy Pelosi's district has a big homeless problem.
Earlier in the day Trump argued, via tweet, that despite the expressions of concern by the evil media and "incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades," the government is perfectly prepared to handle the coronavirus. Which he misspelled "caronavirus." But nobody's perfect.
The president had been saying everything is totally under control for some time. ("It's one person coming in from China.") The whole administration picked up the cry. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, 82, overcame his habit of dozing off at meetings long enough to tell Fox Business Network that the disease would "accelerate the return of jobs" from overseas.
Trump totally agrees. "What it's going to do is keep people home, and they're going to travel to places we have," he said.
See? The virus thing is a bonus.
The runup to the Pence unveiling had not been exactly calming for citizens who wanted to have faith in competent White House oversight. Barack Obama used to have special epidemic-watching groups just in case this kind of crisis developed. One was headed by the highly regarded Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who got sent packing by John Bolton. Another infectious disease expert, Tom Bossert, suddenly vanished from the Department of Homeland Security in 2018, presumably also at the hand of John You-know-who.
Virus Week hasn't really provided a whole lot of comfort to citizens who wanted to believe the president's replacements were super high quality.
The nation got its first real look at Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, who appeared before a Senate subcommittee and admitted he had no idea how the virus was transmitted among humans, exactly how dangerous it was, or ... pretty much anything.
When Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who is not known for anti-administration bias, asked whether the country had enough respirators to deal with a coronavirus epidemic, Wolf answered in the affirmative.
"We just heard testimony that we don't," Kennedy responded.
"OK," said Wolf.
Also part of the new coronavirus response team is Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services - a veteran Cabinet member and experienced former pharmaceutical lobbyist.
At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Azar was asked if he'd consider using some of the billions of dollars in funds for Trump's border wall to help combat the current health crisis.
Azar just chuckled. Actually, people, this is probably not a theme we ought to be pursuing. Chances are, if the president is encouraged to mix the subjects of coronavirus and Mexico walls, he'll suddenly announce that we need a barrier much bigger and thicker and more expensive, so it can stop the flow of immigrant germs.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's visit to India included a state dinner, tens of thousands of cheering onlookers and even a marching band on camels - but a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India was notably absent.
For the second time since September, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the United States, the two countries have failed to reach even a limited "mini-deal" that would increase trade for focused groups of goods, like dairy products, medical devices and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Negotiators from both countries have been working since 2018 on a deal that would lower Indian barriers to some American products, and restore India's access to a program that allows goods to enter the United States tariff-free.
But the breakdown in negotiations illustrates the steep challenge in reaching a trade deal between two countries headed by populist leaders who harbor suspicions of multilateral arrangements. Both Trump and Modi want to protect jobs in their own countries by fending off foreign competitors - shared attributes that make it even more difficult to strike a comprehensive agreement that would roll back trade barriers more broadly.
"Both sides are attuned to their own political imperatives and not where the other side might have an area of accommodation," said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S. India Business Council, who served as assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asia during the Obama administration. "It is hard, then, to find where the common ground is where a deal could be struck."
In appearances alongside Modi on Tuesday, Trump touted an agreement by India to purchase more than $3 billion of U.S. military equipment, as well as other purchasing agreements related to commercial airlines and natural gas.
But urgency toward a deal appears to have faded, with both leaders appearing content for trade barriers to continue. Trump has said he is focused on a larger agreement that could be reached at the end of this year, if the two sides can find common ground.
That may not be easy. During his visit, the president reiterated his previous complaints about India's high tariffs on American products, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other goods.
"We're being charged large amounts of tariffs, and you can't do that," Trump said. "I just said that's unfair, and we're working it out."
Since trade talks began, both the United States and India have escalated tensions by ratcheting up tariffs and trade barriers, rather than lowering them.
In March 2018, Trump included India in the list of countries that would be hit by his steel and aluminum tariffs. India responded with retaliatory tariffs on American almonds, apples and other goods. Last May, the Trump administration stripped India of a special status that exempted billions of dollars of its exports into the United States from tariffs.

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up - to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Slavery Was a Dystopic Form of Socialism

Texto completo: Regarding Jason L. Riley's "A Bid to Revise the New York Times's Bad History" (Upward Mobility, Feb. 19): Slavery was always a curse, never a boon, for the U.S. economy, though it certainly enriched slaveholders. Slaves made important contributions, but slavery itself grossly depressed their productivity, and the productivity of many whites, as became abundantly clear when the freed slaves did more than their fair share to spur the record U.S. economic growth of the post-Civil War period.
Slavery was a dystopic form of socialism where slaves faced 100% taxation and received compensation only "according to their needs," as determined by slaveholders. The end of slavery eliminated these horrible disincentives and inefficiencies, and can be viewed as the largest, most successful targeted tax cut in U.S. history. America succeeded despite slavery, not because of it, and only began to hit its stride when slaves were free at last.
Much of the confusion about slavery stems from the erroneous assumption that the economy is a zero-sum system. We'll never know just how much talent was squandered under the oppression of slavery. Economics is more about cooperation than competition; human wealth is inherently shared and generally magnified every time one of us freely sells, buys or invests. Slavery, which sabotaged full-scale cooperation, wasted tremendous abilities, was indeed a horrifying curse. Yet, the slaves and their progeny, have been a tremendous blessing.

FCC Finds Cell Carriers Failed to Guard Data

Texto completo: The Federal Communications Commission is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from the country's top cellphone carriers after officials found the companies failed to safeguard information about customers' real-time locations, according to people familiar with the matter.
The telecommunications regulator in recent weeks informed AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. of pending notices of apparent liability, the people said. Such notices aren't final, and the companies can still argue they aren't liable or should pay less. It would ultimately fall on the U.S. Justice Department to collect any penalties.
The proposed fines, which could total more than $200 million, are expected to be announced on Friday, one of the people said. Last month, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai notified members of Congress that an agency investigation had concluded that "one or more" carriers had apparently violated federal law by disclosing real-time location data.
The FCC moved after some of the carriers had continued sharing their subscribers' coordinates even after they told members of Congress they were cutting off the middlemen companies from using their data feeds. Verizon has said it stopped sharing cellular location data in 2018. AT&T and T-Mobile said in early 2019 that they were cutting off some location data sharing.
The top U.S. wireless providers agreed to curb their data sharing after independent reporting found data aggregators were misusing feeds that provided subscribers' real-time locations. Upon request, the carriers would pinpoint specific subscribers and share the result with middlemen companies, which then shared the information with hundreds of other businesses.
Some privacy advocates criticized the FCC action as overdue.
"Consumers have no choice but to share highly private information with a provider about everywhere they go" to obtain cellular service, said Laura Moy, associate director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law. "Carriers are not allowed to turn around and sell that location information to anyone with a phone number and a few dollars to spend. But this has been a widespread practice, and the FCC has been slow to rein it in."
Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who wrote to carriers in 2018 after the location-sharing partnerships were revealed to ask about their data privacy practices, called the proposed fines inadequate. He said in a tweet that strong privacy legislation was needed.
Cellphone companies need to know their subscribers' coordinates to route calls and data to the right place. That gives them a more consistent view of customers' movements than app developers, which use global positioning systems, Wi-Fi and other data sources that users can shut off through their smartphone settings. Wireless carriers also sell anonymized location data to marketers.
Data aggregators LocationSmart Inc. and Zumigo Inc. told The Wall Street Journal they distributed real-time locations to legitimate clients, including bank fraud-detection departments and roadside assistance services. But others used the data feeds for what the carriers said were unauthorized purposes. One prison phone provider created a website that let law-enforcement agencies find the location of any cellphone user without obtaining a court order, the New York Times and Motherboard have reported.
The FCC didn't offer the carriers any settlements, one of the people said. That might prompt some carriers to fight the charges against them through the commission's administrative process.
The fines, if paid, could fall heavily on T-Mobile if it closes its planned merger with Sprint in the coming weeks. The two companies recently revised the terms of that agreement, which was worth $26 billion when it was signed two years ago. Under the revised merger, the parents of T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to split the cost of any liabilities up to $200 million. Sprint owner SoftBank Group Corp. would be on the hook for excess liabilities above $200 million.

Free classes include discussions about local history, ukulele lessons, knitting and more
Readfield U will help residents and people from neighboring communities get through the tail end of winter. Residents of Readfield will share their skills and knowledge in free classes and get-togethers through the month of March, according to a news release from Maggie Edmondson.
The free classes will range from learning about Lyme disease to trying a hand at playing the ukulele, from talks about local history and far-flung travel to techniques for solving the New York Times crossword puzzle.
This is neighbors getting to know neighbors and their community better, and learning something new along the way. While all classes will be held in Readfield, people from neighboring communities are welcome. Apart from the classes, there will be a family games night and two community potluck suppers — one celebrating Maine’s Bicentennial on March 14, and one at the end of the month to celebrate the fun of Readfield U.
Many elements of the community have come together to make this month-long program happen. Readfield’s Age-Friendly Committee and Community Library joined by other interested community members have done the planning, the Masonic Lodge, United Methodist Church, Town Hall, Library, Kents Hill School and Maranacook High School will provide spaces for the events.

Free classes include discussions about local history, ukulele lessons, knitting and more
Readfield U will help residents and people from neighboring communities get through the tail end of winter. Residents of Readfield will share their skills and knowledge in free classes and get-togethers through the month of March, according to a news release from Maggie Edmondson.
The free classes will range from learning about Lyme disease to trying a hand at playing the ukulele, from talks about local history and far-flung travel to techniques for solving the New York Times crossword puzzle.
This is neighbors getting to know neighbors and their community better, and learning something new along the way. While all classes will be held in Readfield, people from neighboring communities are welcome. Apart from the classes, there will be a family games night and two community potluck suppers — one celebrating Maine’s Bicentennial on March 14, and one at the end of the month to celebrate the fun of Readfield U.
Many elements of the community have come together to make this month-long program happen. Readfield’s Age-Friendly Committee and Community Library joined by other interested community members have done the planning, the Masonic Lodge, United Methodist Church, Town Hall, Library, Kents Hill School and Maranacook High School will provide spaces for the events.

Texto completo: Couples mingled on a recent Saturday night, sipping wine and sharing stories about relationships.
The venue was not a trendy Downtown bar, but a suburban bookstore. And there was no charge for the wine and cheese.
The center of attention at Riverstone Books in McCandless was Brooke Barker and her husband, Boaz Frankel, promoting "Let's Be Weird Together - a book about love." The heavily illustrated book is quirky and witty, with people and animals whimsically drawn by Ms. Barker.
The couple, who met in Portland, Ore., and married in 2017, now live in Shadyside with their dog, Kip.
They chatted with more than 30 in the audience, which included Rick Sebak, Pittsburgh's nationally known writer and documentary producer who is a fan of Mr. Frankel's podcasts.
Books were sold and signed, and Ms. Barker created a customized drawing for each buyer.
Ms. Barker's earlier book, "Sad Animal Facts," has an Instagram account with 400,000 followers, including Ashton Waterman and her daughters, Madi, 15, and Violet, 7, who drove four hours from South Hanover, Pa., to meet the author and her husband.
Barbara Jeremiah, of Hampton, opened Riverstone because she thought the North Hills needed an independent bookstore. She wanted her store to be a part of a community of book lovers; a brick-and-mortar store that hosted lots of events.
And, as another part of building community, Ms. Jeremiah always makes room on the shelves for books written by local authors, including those who have self-published their work.
Since the store opened in October 2017, "it's going well," said Ms. Jeremiah, who retired as an Alcoa executive in 2009. "Sales have been up each year."
Indie bookstores on the rise
Riverstone Books seems to be the right thing at the right time. Small independent bookstores are making a strong comeback, according to a 2019 report from the American Booksellers Association, a nonprofit trade organization. There was a 49% increase in the number of so-called "indie" bookstores from 2009 to 2018, the report said, increasing from 1,651 to 2,470.
Meanwhile, the national chain Borders, which sold books and music, went out of business in 2011. In recent years the largest American bookstore chain, Barnes&Noble, closed a number of stores in an ongoing battle to remain economically viable.
Still, the biggest threat to indie booksellers is Amazon, which has prices that small local stores can't top. So indies, including Riverstone, also sell a wide array of gift items including hand-made soap, candles, literacy-themed socks and tote bags.
But Amazon can't compete with indies when it comes to events, said Robin Carroll, events coordinator at Riverstone. There were 13 events at the store in the first two weeks of February, including a recent sold-out presentation by a ballerina from Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.
Large crowds come to Riverstore to hear authors such as former Steelers lineman Tunch Ilkin and New York Times best selling author W. Bruce Cameron, who wrote "A Dog's Purpose" and other dog stories, including two books made into movies.
Most events are free, but VIP events for authors like Mr. Cameron have a fee.
A free Valentine's Day event earlier this month featured jazz singer Jessica Lee and guitarist Mark Strickland.
The biggest Riverstone event attracted 400 who wanted to meet Melissa Hartwig Urban, co-founder of the Whole30 diet program. This event was moved offsite to the Masonic Center in Ross.
Dogs attended Mr. Cameron's appearance last November, and dogs are again welcome at Riverstone on April 4 at 4 p.m. for Victoria Schade, one of the trainers for Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl program. She's promoting her new novel, "Who Rescued Who." With her will be Tori Mistick, of Point Breeze, who writes the Wear Wag Repeat blog for "dog moms."
The schedule of events and updates on books can be found at Riverstone's website (www.riverstonebookstore.com) and on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
Some other similar independently owned bookstores include:
* Penguin Bookshop, in business in Sewickley since 1929. Details, call 412-741-3838.
* Completely Booked opened in September 2019 at 201 Blue Spruce Way, Murrysville, 724-575-7520.
* The Tiny Bookstore at 1130 Perrysville Highway, Ross; open limited days and hours, 412-585-2651.
* Mystery Lovers Bookshop in Oakmont, 412-828-4877.
* A independent children's bookstore, Spark Books, is on Brilliant Avenue in Aspinwall, 412-781-1987.

GLOBAL TRADE WARS BREED UNCERTAINTY IN S.C.

Texto completo: GREENVILLE, S.C. - Glen Calder sees dollar signs in Walmart parking lots, driveways and new housing developments - and demand for his company's asphalt-spreading machines has boomed with this fast-growing region of upstate South Carolina.
Once called the "Textile Capital of the World," Greenville has been a center of sweeping economic transition that has lured multinational companies, highly automated factories and corporate headquarters. The trend is similar to the Pittsburgh region's shift to health care, education, banking and technology industries after the decline of steel in the 1980s.
Yet Mr. Calder's business has suffered in recent years: His costs have risen after the Trump administration slapped 25% import tariffs on the heart of his machines: a 110-horsepower Cummins diesel engine.
"Our biggest obstacle have been the trade challenges with China," said Mr. Calder, whose his 25-year family business employs about 75 people. "It's been hard to plan for and adjust, and as a result our margins have taken a beating."
As the Palmetto State prepares to hit the polls this Saturday for the Democratic presidential primary election, much of the attention has been on the racial diversity of the state. Candidates have courted black voters, and for good reason: Roughly 60% of Democratic voters in South Carolina are black, a contrast to other early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white, and Nevada, which is largely Latino.
But the "First in the South" primary will also feature the first major manufacturing state to vote, providing an early test for how much Mr. Trump's trade policy will factor into the 2020 race.
Mr. Trump has staked much of his re-election bid on his trade agenda, driven by tariffs imposed on hundreds of billions of Chinese imports, including Mr. Calder's engines. The bulk of his "foreign policy" section on his re-election website is dedicated to his trade actions.
Few other states are better examples of how Mr. Trump's trade barriers have scrambled the politics of trade. Though Mr. Trump carried South Carolina by 14 points in the 2016 general election - and won the 2016 Republican primary, too - the state hews to free trade ideals that Mr. Trump despises. Thanks to a growing population of consumers, South Carolina has embedded itself in global supply chains after attracting foreign companies with tax incentives, cheap land and non-union workforces.
"We are a global gateway," said Jack Ellenberg, an administrator at Clemson University and former executive with the South Carolina State Ports Authority. "Imports go toward population growth, while exports leave from where you make things. South Carolina is at the center of both of those things."
The booming trade has led to significantly bigger ships. Bigger ships have demanded deeper ports and taller cranes to handle the cargo.
The Charleston Harbor, home to the second-busiest container port on the East Coast, is deepening its seafloor by 7 feet, a $558 million project that will make it the coast's deepest port upon completion next year. The port also is purchasing 15 cranes that reaching 155 feet, 40 feet higher than the current ones.
During a busy afternoon on Tuesday, the port's crane operators unloaded containers from three docked ships. Trade with Asian countries makes up 43% of the port's volumes, a bigger chunk than Europe, according to port data.
While the port's volumes have remained strong, growing "the overall impact of tariffs is broader reaching," said Jim Newsome, president and CEO of the South Carolina Ports Authority.
"The Southeast is historically a rich area for foreign direct investment, and uncertainty stymies such projects," he added. "We support free trade and hope to see the trade issues resolved soon to enable a thriving global supply chain and economy."
Luring multinational producers
Much like steel, textile production grew to a fever pitch during World War II, with 65% of canvas for the U.S. Army being made in Greenville and 3 in 4 Greenville residents touched the textile business in some way, according to the city's Upcountry History Museum.
Mr. Calder said he remembers watching the gradual loss of the textile industry moving to offshore locations like China and Southeast Asia - first the mills shuttered, then the equipment companies that supplied them.
South Carolina has turned to the automotive, airline and health care industries, attracting primary manufacturers like BMW, Volvo, Boeing, Daimler, Honda, Bosch and Siemens. Those companies also support a deep supply chain: factories that make electronics, seats and even textiles for automobile interiors, he said.
In 1985, Michelin, the French tire maker, opened its North American headquarters about a 10-minute drive down the road from Mr. Calder's factory. Michelin operates a dozen plants in the state and employs nearly 10,000 people. It operates the world's largest rubber processing plant in nearby Sandy Springs.
Driven by demand to ship auto parts and aircraft components, the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport District opened a $33 million, 110,000-square-foot cargo facility last year. Total trade figures at the regional airport were up by 38% in 2019.
"The upstate has a lot of ties to Europe," said Scott Carr, vice president for commercial business and communications for the airport. "We've positioned ourselves well."
South Carolina economic development officials stressed that the state's manufacturing powerhouse has not been measurably dampened by the trade wars. Exports increased by 19% to $41.5 billion in 2019, driven by high-value Boeing planes sent as part of a deal with the United Arab Emirates. Imports totaled $42.3 billion last year.
"They're sophisticated companies," said Alex Clark, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Commerce, which has written letters of support for companies filing for exclusion from the Trump administration.
"They can be flexible, seeing some of the uncertainty," she said. "I think they can look and make adjustments."
On Thursday, Mr. Calder showed off the assembly of his paving equipment from heaps of steel components to a gleaming, freshly painted machine. Mr. Calder said his company, Calder Brothers, has paid nearly $100,000 in tariffs but hasn't filed for an exclusion from the tariffs because the company doesn't have the resources to go through the process.
A Republican who voted for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., over Mr. Trump in the 2016 primary election, Mr. Calder had mixed reviews on the president's economic policies.
"If I had to say one way or another, I would say he has been a positive to the economy," Mr. Calder said. But he added, "I think we need to keep pushing on that pro-business, pro-manufacturing policies that help us be competitive in a very global market. That means putting this trade war behind us."

Texto completo: A documentary from Lauren Greenfield airs on Showtime. And "RuPaul's Drag Race" returns for a new season on VH1.
What's on TV
THE KINGMAKER (2019) 9 p.m. Showtime. Gold and diamonds commingle with political unrest and poverty in "The Kingmaker," Lauren Greenfield's documentary portrait of Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines. Through interviews -- including with Marcos, who speaks here at length -- and other footage, Greenfield ("The Queen of Versailles") examines Marcos's time as first lady during the 1960s, '70s and '80s; her subsequent flight and exile; and her place in contemporary politics. The film ultimately "becomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "Greenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes -- those notorious emblems of Marcos's excess -- but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury," Dargis wrote. "It's an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history."
RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE 8 p.m. on VH1. "Friday, February 28th, 13 new candidates enter the race." No, that sentence isn't pulled from the nightmares of the Democratic presidential candidates bracing themselves for Super Tuesday; it's from a trailer for the latest season of RuPaul Charles's flagship drag show, which will kick off its search for "America's first drag-queen president." That search will be aided by a collection of celebrity guests peppered throughout the season, including Nicki Minaj, Whoopi Goldberg, Leslie Jones, Chaka Khan and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
DATELINE 9 p.m. on NBC. In 2013, Karl Holger Karlsen pleaded guilty to murdering his son in order to collect a life insurance policy. Earlier this month, Karlsen was convicted of killing his wife years earlier for the same reason. Those cases are the focus of this week's edition of NBC's "Dateline" series, which brings together interviews with those close to the events -- including Karlsen himself.
What's Streaming
THE EDGE OF HEAVEN (2008) Stream on Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon. The writer-director Fatih Akin won the best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival for "The Edge of Heaven," his critically acclaimed look at generational differences and the experience of Turkish immigrants in Germany. As the lives of its disparate characters -- mothers and daughters, a father and a son -- weave together, "there is a sense of human connections becoming stronger and thicker, of a fragile moral order coalescing beneath the randomness and cruelty of modern life," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "By the end," he added, "you know the characters in it so well that you can't believe you've seen the movie only once, yet on a second viewing it seems completely new."
ALL THE BRIGHT PLACES (2020) Stream on Netflix. Elle Fanning and Justice Smith star in this adaptation of a Y.A. novel by Jennifer Niven, directed by Brett Haley ("The Hero"). The story centers on a pair of Indiana teenagers, Violet (Elle) and Theodore (Smith), who help each other cope with mental illness.

Texto completo: Readers discuss Thomas L. Friedman's idea for a "national unity" ticket that includes many of the contenders as well as Mitt Romney and AOC in cabinet posts.
To the Editor:
Re "Dems, You Can Defeat Trump in a Landslide," by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Feb. 26):
The only way I could get to sleep after Tuesday night's acrimonious debate was by taking an antacid followed by an Ambien. So it was a great relief to wake up Wednesday morning to Mr. Friedman's column.
What a brilliant suggestion -- making a place for everyone at the table. Putting one another down isn't helping Democrats defeat President Trump. If anything, it's just giving him more Twitter fodder to energize his troops.
Yes, the candidates are in competition for who is going to lead the party in November against the bully in the White House. But victory won't come when there's only one left standing and all who should be allies lie wounded on the battlefield. The fight is not progressive versus moderate, but rather the Democratic Party and all that it stands for united against Mr. Trump and his enablers in the Senate.
I think Mr. Friedman has the right answer. Put aside the rancor and the winner-take-all mentality. Form a unified effort. Create a team of rivals to make sure that all the voices are heard. When everyone's candidate has a role, everyone is a winner.
Arthur C. Benedict
Peaks Island, Me.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman may be right -- Democratic candidates need to form a unity ticket, a team of rivals. But who can persuade them to bury their egos and do so? Only former President Barack Obama. How much longer will he stay silent?
Martha Jablow
Philadelphia
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman was able to put into words thoughts that have been circulating in my head for a few weeks. My only concern is whether the cabinet members would be approved -- which, of course, reminds me of how important our Senate elections are.
Lynne Burke
Darien, Conn.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman has the right idea. The Democratic Party should have a "big tent," and the nominee should promise to include in his or her cabinet the entire spectrum of the party. Unfortunately, it seems that there is an ideological test in the extreme left wing of the party that would make this idea unfeasible.
When Elizabeth Warren depicts Michael Bloomberg as a racist, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says Joe Biden shouldn't be in her party, when Bernie Sanders labels the very wealthy as the enemy for no other reason than that they are rich, then it is hard to see them joining together. And that will lead to the re-election of Donald Trump.
Jay Stonehill
Sarasota, Fla.
To the Editor:
Yes, we need a national unity ticket. But can we afford to take all those strong leaders out of the Senate? Or is Thomas Friedman suggesting that such a ticket will bring some of the members of the "dead" Republican Party back to life?
Anthony Wight
Branford, Conn.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman has a very exciting group of proposed cabinet members to make a Bernie Sanders candidacy very compelling -- with one glaring exception. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for ambassador to the United Nations? Really! What was he thinking?
She is a young, inexperienced woman with little understanding of foreign affairs and diplomacy. What is most terrifying is that after Nikki Haley made significant inroads against constant Israel bashing at the U.N., AOC would only encourage a resurgence of such anti-Israel bias.
Mendy Kwestel
Fair Lawn, N.J.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman's brilliant idea for the Democratic Party -- announcing a ticket that includes prospective cabinet choices -- might go one step further. Imagine a coordinated campaign of messages that show split-screen images. The well-chosen, well-qualified and well-intentioned Democratic choices on the left and the current stable of inexperienced, obsequious and sycophantic Trump administration cabinet members on the right.
For example, Mike Bloomberg or Bernie Sanders vs. Steven Mnuchin, Cory Booker vs. Ben Carson, Michael Bennet vs. Betsy DeVos.
Steve Cony
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman has a good idea for candidates to announce their cabinet picks early, and he makes some fabulous suggestions. But his pronouncement of the death of the Republican Party might be premature. A Republican V.P. running with a Democratic presidential candidate would make it a true "unity ticket." I propose either Mitt Romney or John Kasich.
Todd Buchanan
Eldora, Colo.
To the Editor:
At first I thought Thomas Friedman's column offered an amusing "pie in the sky" idea, but the current times are so insane that perhaps an out-of-left-field idea is just what we need. I pray that all the candidates have read it.
Baxter Holland
Rutland, Vt.
To the Editor:
Thomas Friedman has a glaring omission from his proposed "team of rivals": Gov. Jay Inslee as the secretary of a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Climate Change.

Silicon Valley Needs the Government

Texto completo: We can't win the technology wars without the federal government's help.
America's companies and universities innovate like no other places on earth. We are garage start-ups, risk-taking entrepreneurs and intrepid scholars exploring new advances in science and technology. But that is only part of the story.
Many of Silicon Valley's leaders got their start with grants from the federal government -- including me. My graduate work in computer science in the 1970s and '80s was funded in part by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
But in recent years, Americans -- Silicon Valley leaders included -- have put too much faith in the private sector to ensure U.S. global leadership in new technology. Now we are in a technology competition with China that has profound ramifications for our economy and defense -- a reality I have come to appreciate as chairman of two government panels on innovation and national security. The government needs to get back in the game in a serious way.
Important trends are not in our favor. America's lead in artificial intelligence, for example, is precarious. A.I. will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a Defense Department priority. Leading the world in A.I. is essential to growing our economy and protecting our security. A recent study considering more than 100 metrics finds that the United States is well ahead of China today but will fall behind in five to 10 years. China also has almost twice as many supercomputers and about 15 times as many deployed 5G base stations as the United States. If current trends continue, China's overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.
Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more research and development investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies and stronger computing infrastructure.
An independent federal commission on A.I., which I lead, recently concluded that if A.I. advances elsewhere outpace those of U.S. companies and the U.S. government, and give commercial and military advantages to our rivals, "the resulting disadvantage to the United States could endanger U.S. national security and global stability." The same could be said for other emerging technologies.
And there are broader implications. Americans should be wary of living in a world shaped by China's view of the relationship between technology and authoritarian governance. Free societies must prove the resilience of liberal democracy in the face of technological changes that threaten it.
What should a U.S. strategy involve? The government should begin by setting out national priorities across emerging technologies, with a special focus on research areas that could enhance our defense and security. This month's budget request from the White House would double nondefense research funding by 2022 in two areas -- A.I. and quantum information science. That is welcome news, but Congress should go further by making similar increases across a broader range of emerging fields, such as biotechnology.
We should plan to double funding in those fields again as we build institutional capacity in labs and research centers. These resources should support the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy and other grant-giving agencies. At the same time, Congress should meet the president's request for the highest level of defense R & D funding in over 70 years, and the Defense Department should capitalize on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities in A.I., quantum, hypersonics and other priority technology areas.
We should incentivize the emergence of a competitive alternative to Huawei, the Chinese company that leads in 5G network technology, by expanding the bandwidth the government makes available to private companies.
We need unprecedented partnerships between government and industry. For example, a partnership should expand affordable access to cloud computing for university researchers and students. A new proposal from Stanford for a "National Research Cloud" offers a vision for this.
We should accelerate discovery by creating more flexible ways to fund the most promising researchers for multiple years at a time. This opens longer-term paths to scientific discovery.
We should undertake major efforts to train up-and-coming scientists and engineers, and attract more global technology experts to the United States. A majority of computer scientists with graduate degrees working in America were born abroad, as were most current graduate students studying computer science in U.S. universities. They are a source of national strength. A vast majority want to stay and contribute to American innovation. We must make it easier for them to do so. There is no need to wait for comprehensive immigration reform: We can change the immigration process for highly skilled people now to reduce the red tape, backlogs and uncertainty that threaten to drive tech talent to other countries -- including to our strategic competitors.
Finally, we must address the concerns Americans rightly have about privacy, security, algorithmic bias, technical standards and the potential impact new technologies will have on the work force. If the American public does not trust the benefits of new technologies, those doubts will hold us back. Despite earnest efforts, the tech community has not demonstrated convincingly that it can regulate itself. The wide-ranging societal impact of A.I. in particular warrants government involvement.
To be sure, while we are competing with the Chinese, we should also work with them. There are many areas where cooperation can help everyone -- for example in A.I.-based approaches to climate challenges, space exploration, disaster relief and pandemics.
These recommendations are informed by recent experiences in industry and public service, but they are inspired by the conviction instilled when I was a much younger man that a wise federal strategy can spur innovation, drive private enterprise and renew American leadership.
Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the world's leading innovators, and the United States is not playing to win. A bold, bipartisan initiative can extend our country's technology advantage beyond what many experts predict. Success matters for more than our companies' bottom lines and our military's battlefield edge. We must show that these new technologies can advance individual liberty and strengthen free societies. For the American model to win, the American government must lead.

Texto completo: The latest from James McBride and Hilary Mantel, a follow-up to "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," a timely call to abolish the Electoral College and more.
'Capital and Ideology,' by Thomas Piketty (Belknap/Harvard University Press, March 10)
A follow-up to Piketty's blockbuster about economic inequality, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century," this new book -- translated by Arthur Goldhammer -- suggests that wealth disparity is tied to politics and other human institutions.
'The City We Became,' by N.K. Jemisin (Orbit, March 24)
A mash-up of fantasy, superheroes, hip-hop and comics, Jemisin's new novel -- the first in a projected trilogy -- is a joyful love letter to New York that unfolds as five ordinary citizens who embody the very soul of the city find themselves struggling to save it.
'Deacon King Kong,' by James McBride (Riverhead, March 3)
This novel, by the National Book Award-winning author of "The Good Lord Bird," is practically impossible to categorize: It's a crime story, a mystery and a darkly funny portrait of a community in revolt, all set off when a South Brooklyn deacon nicknamed Sportcoat shoots a local drug dealer.
'The Exhibition of Persephone Q,' by Jessi Jezewska Stevens (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, March 3)
When Percy receives a catalog for an art exhibition that features altered images of a nude woman in bed, it takes time for her to realize she is the woman in the photos. This dreamy debut novel follows Percy in the aftermath of 9/11 as she contemplates her relationships and considers the real meaning of identity.
'The Glass Hotel,' by Emily St. John Mandel (Knopf, March 24)
Vincent, once a bartender at an upscale hotel, marries a fabulously wealthy Madoff-like man who is running a vast Ponzi scheme. As she did in her last novel, "Station Eleven," Mandel surveys the wreckage in the wake of disaster -- in this case, the fallout after the fraud collapses.
'Let the People Pick the President: The Case for Abolishing the Electoral College,' by Jesse Wegman (St. Martin's, March 17)
A deeply researched, informative and timely argument in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. Wegman, a member of The Times's editorial board, draws from the history of the institution and information from campaign workers to make his case.
'The Mirror and the Light,' by Hilary Mantel (Holt, March 10)
Mantel concludes her blockbuster "Wolf Hall" trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, the cunning, wily minister to Henry VIII. Picking up in 1536 with the decapitation of Anne Boleyn, Mantel zeros in on Cromwell as he consolidates his power.
[ Read our profile of Mantel . | Read our review . ]
'The Mountains Sing,' by Nguyen Phan Que Mai (Algonquin, March 17)
Generations of a Vietnamese family grapple with the legacy of violence, colonialism and war as a woman tells her childhood history to her granddaughter during the Vietnam War. This is the first book that Que Mai, a celebrated Vietnamese poet, has written in English.
'My Dark Vanessa,' by Kate Elizabeth Russell (Morrow, March 10)
A high school student's stormy relationship with her teacher, and her changing perceptions of it, are the focus of this unsettling debut. After the teacher is accused by another student years later, Vanessa reckons with fallout of her relationship, examining power, memory and trauma through a #MeToo lens.
'Nobody Will Tell You This but Me: A True (As Told to Me) Story,' by Bess Kalb (Knopf, March 17)
Kalb, a writer for "Jimmy Kimmel Live," channels the voice of her beloved grandmother, Bobby, in this affecting project, which she calls an oral history of four generations of women in her family. The book brims with anecdotes, advice from Bobby, texts and even transcribed voice mail messages.
'Sharks in the Time of Saviors,' by Kawai Strong Washburn (MCD, March 3)
When 9-year-old Nainoa Flores is tossed overboard on a family vacation, the sharks soon start circling. But instead of the worst, the animals safely return the child -- a blessing his parents see as the work of ancient Hawaiian gods. Washburn's buzzy debut novel explores the shifting bonds of family and the inescapable pull of home.
'This Is Chance: The Shaking of an All-American City, a Voice That Held It All Together,' by Jon Mooallem (Random House, March 24)
In 1964, disaster struck Anchorage, Alaska, in the form of a 9.2-magnitude earthquake. Mooallem reconstructs the event and the days that followed, when a plucky local radio reporter kept the city going through her tireless broadcasts.
'Wow, No Thank You: Essays,' by Samantha Irby (Vintage, March 31)
Irby, the hilarious author of "Meaty" and "We Are Never Meeting in Real Life," is bitterly funny on the peculiarities of aging, marriage and life in the Midwest.

Texto completo: The mayor's attacks on Michael Bloomberg have spurred a social media war with allies of the presidential candidate.
Two weeks after endorsing Bernie Sanders for president, Mayor Bill de Blasio has wasted no time and few gibes going to work as his surrogate.
He urged Pete Buttigieg on Twitter to "not be so smug when you just got your ass kicked" in the Nevada caucuses. He told Joseph R. Biden Jr. to "wake up!" to families that want better health care.
But most of the mayor's ire has been directed toward his predecessor in City Hall, Michael R. Bloomberg.
He said Mr. Bloomberg's policies as mayor were racist. He asserted that he has been "cleaning up Michael Bloomberg's mess for six years."
And any suggestion to the contrary from Mr. Bloomberg? "Self-centered delusion," the mayor wrote on Twitter.
With his own presidential campaign an unqualified bust, Mr. de Blasio appears to have found his voice and renewed vigor as an attack dog for Mr. Sanders, the Democratic front-runner.
The most visceral component of that surrogacy has been Mr. de Blasio's criticism of Mr. Bloomberg, enabling him to return to the theme of his successful 2013 mayoral campaign in which he cast himself as the anti-Bloomberg.
On Wednesday night, Mr. de Blasio appeared on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News for a second time -- a forum where few Democrats venture.
The interview began with Mr. Hannity playing a clip of Mr. Bloomberg talking about his stop-and-frisk policy of throwing young men against walls.
"Thank you for playing that for your millions of viewers, because now more people are going to see who Mike Bloomberg really is," Mr. de Blasio said.
The mayor's attacks have angered Mr. Bloomberg's allies, who have mostly avoided criticizing Mr. de Blasio even during his fleeting run for president last year. That informal policy has clearly ended.
"Few public officials anywhere are as innovative and clever as Bill de Blasio when it comes to repeated efforts at money laundering," Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, posted on Twitter, referring to Mr. de Blasio's questionable fund-raising practices.
Mr. Loeser said it was his decision, not Mr. Bloomberg's, to speak out against Mr. de Blasio.
"If he wants to present himself as an opinion maker to the American people, we're going to have to remind people about his full legacy in office," Mr. Loeser said in a phone interview, pointing to a de Blasio donor who pleaded guilty to using campaign contributions as bribes.
Mr. de Blasio's attacks are a desperate attempt to gain relevance, Mr. Loeser said.
"It's no secret that Bill de Blasio loves national politics and loves it more than being mayor," he said.
Mr. de Blasio's advocacy for Mr. Sanders has spurred speculation that the mayor may be strategically laying the groundwork for a spot in a future Sanders administration. The two are longtime allies; Mr. Sanders swore Mr. de Blasio in at his second mayoral inauguration.
Karen Hinton, a former press secretary for Mr. de Blasio, said his affection for Mr. Sanders was real, but suggested that he might also want a cabinet post like secretary of housing and urban development.
"It's where his heart has been all along," she said of the Sanders endorsement, "but that doesn't mean he isn't also interested in working in the administration."
The last time Mr. de Blasio visited Mr. Hannity's show was in August when the mayor was trying to generate attention for his failing presidential campaign. They sparred for 41 minutes over various topics, from immigration and gun control to abortion and meatless Mondays the city's schools.
This time, Mr. Hannity, an ally of Mr. Trump's, found common ground with Mr. de Blasio over their disdain for Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Bloomberg has no "bedside manner" and "no common touch, no connection to people," Mr. de Blasio said, before playfully inviting Mr. Hannity to Mr. Sanders's inauguration.
Jon Paul Lupo, an adviser to Mr. de Blasio, said the mayor had consistently made the same arguments against Mr. Bloomberg.
"Mayor de Blasio is bringing the receipts, and you have to defend your record," Mr. Lupo said.
Mr. Bloomberg, who served as mayor for 12 years, is actually more popular among New Yorkers. His approval rating is 59 percent among New York City residents, according to a Siena College poll this month. Mr. de Blasio, who is facing lame duck status with less than two years left in office, had his approval rating fall below 35 percent last year.
Joseph Borelli, a Republican councilman from Staten Island, said he enjoyed watching Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bloomberg duke it out.
"It's fun as a Republican, but it's also fun as a student of New York City politics," Mr. Borelli said. He noted that many of the reporters covering the presidential race and the White House had once covered Mr. Bloomberg or Mr. de Blasio in New York, and "know where all the bodies are buried."
"You don't get that with Mayor Pete," he said, chuckling, "or God knows who covers Burlington, Vermont."

Texto completo: The digital services churned out by the world's computer centers are multiplying, but their energy use is not, thanks to cloud computing, a new study says.
The computer engine rooms that power the digital economy have become surprisingly energy efficient.
A new study of data centers globally found that while their computing output jumped sixfold from 2010 to 2018, their energy consumption rose only 6 percent. The scientists' findings suggest concerns that the rise of mammoth data centers would generate a surge in electricity demand and pollution have been greatly overstated.
The major force behind the improving efficiency is the shift to cloud computing. In the cloud model, businesses and individuals consume computing over the internet as services, from raw calculation and data storage to search and social networks.
The largest cloud data centers, sometimes the size of football fields, are owned and operated by big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.
Each of these sprawling digital factories, housing hundreds of thousands of computers, rack upon rack, is an energy-hungry behemoth. Some have been built near the Arctic for natural cooling and others beside huge hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest.
Still, they are the standard setters in terms of the amount of electricity needed for a computing task. "The public thinks these massive data centers are energy bad guys," said Eric Masanet, the lead author of the study. "But those data centers are the most efficient in the world."
The study findings were published on Thursday in an article in the journal Science. It was a collaboration of five scientists at Northwestern University, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and an independent research firm. The project was funded by the Department of Energy and by a grant from a Northwestern alumnus who is an environmental philanthropist.
The new research is a stark contrast to often-cited predictions that energy consumption in the world's data centers is on a runaway path, perhaps set to triple or more over the next decade. Those worrying projections, the study authors say, are simplistic extrapolations and what-if scenarios that focus mainly on the rising demand for data center computing.
By contrast, the new research is a bottom-up analysis that compiles information on data center processors, storage, software, networking and cooling from a range of sources to estimate actual electricity use. Enormous efficiency improvements, they conclude, have allowed computing output to increase sharply while power consumption has been essentially flat.
"We're hopeful that this research will reset people's intuitions about data centers and energy use," said Jonathan Koomey, a former scientist at the Berkeley lab who is an independent researcher.
Over the years, data center electricity consumption has been a story of economic incentives and technology advances combining to tackle a problem.
From 2000 to 2005, energy use in computer centers doubled. In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency forecast another doubling of power consumed by data centers from 2005 to 2010.
In 2011, at the request of The New York Times, Mr. Koomey made an assessment of how much data center electricity consumption actually did increase between 2005 and 2010. He estimated the global increase at 56 percent, far less than previously expected. The recession after the 2008 financial crisis played a role, but so did gains in efficiency. The new study, with added data, lowered that 2005 to 2010 estimate further.
But the big improvements have come in recent years. Since 2010, the study authors write in Science, "the data center landscape has changed dramatically."
The tectonic shift has been to the cloud. In 2010, the researchers estimated that 79 percent of data center computing was done in smaller traditional computer centers, largely owned and run by non-tech companies. By 2018, 89 percent of data center computing took place in larger, utility-style cloud data centers.
The big cloud data centers use tailored chips, high-density storage, so-called virtual-machine software, ultrafast networking and customized airflow systems -- all to increase computing firepower with the least electricity.
"The big tech companies eke out every bit of efficiency for every dollar they spend," said Mr. Masanet, who left Northwestern last month to join the faculty of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Google is at the forefront. Its data centers on average generate seven times more computing power than they did just five years ago, using no more electricity, according to Urs Hölzle, a senior vice president who oversees Google's data center technology.
In 2018, data centers consumed about 1 percent of the world's electricity output. That is the energy-consumption equivalent of 17 million American households, a sizable amount of energy use -- but barely growing.
The trend of efficiency gains largely offsetting rising demand should hold for three or four years, the researchers conclude. But beyond a few years, they say, the outlook is uncertain.
In the Science article, they recommend steps including more investment in energy-saving research and improved measurement and information sharing by data center operators worldwide.
The next few years, they write, will be "a critical transition phase to ensure a low-carbon and energy-efficient future."

Vow of Executive Restraint, With a Bit of Wiggle Room

Texto completo: The former New York City mayor laid out his views on the scope and limits of presidential authority and potential post-Trump curbs.
WASHINGTON -- If Michael R. Bloomberg is elected president, he says he would be "extremely reluctant" to order the military to attack another country without congressional authorization or an imminent threat to the United States. But he left himself wiggle room, stopping short of saying it would be unconstitutional for him to use force without lawmakers' approval in other situations.
"It would be unwise for me as a candidate for president to categorically rule out committing the armed forces in such circumstances," he wrote. "I know that unforeseen circumstances can arise in matters of national security. But bypassing Congress should only be contemplated when action is necessary to protect the country and is limited in scope and duration."
Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, laid out his views in written answers to a New York Times survey of presidential candidates about their understanding of the scope of executive power on a range of issues that have arisen over the past two decades. The Times conducted the main survey last summer, before Mr. Bloomberg had entered the race.
The Times has published Mr. Bloomberg's full answers online, alongside those of 19 other current and former candidates -- including those who have qualified for recent debates: Joseph R. Biden Jr., Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren.
Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official in George W. Bush's administration, said that while many of Mr. Bloomberg's responses were fairly conventional, his stated inclinations about when he would unilaterally use force abroad seemed narrower than recent presidents of both parties.
"While preserving wiggle room, the thrust is that the president should not use force except in cases of self-defense, pretty narrowly conceived," he said. "That position would rule out Trump's use of force in Syria in response to chemical weapons attacks, Obama's use of force in Libya and in some strikes in Iraq, and some of the broader statements of self-defense power made during the George W. Bush administration."
The Times also asked Mr. Bloomberg to respond to a lengthy list of potential new legal curbs on executive power raised by previous norms of presidential behavior that Mr. Trump has violated or challenged.
Mr. Bloomberg said he would consider signing legislation to constrain presidents from dangling pardons "in a self-protective context," appointing close family members to White House positions, intervening in pending Justice Department law enforcement actions, firing a special prosecutor who is investigating potential high-level wrongdoing by the executive branch and accepting nonfinancial assistance from foreign governments for political gain.
Notably, the potential overhauls he favorably singled out did not include several other issues raised by Mr. Trump's behavior that might also affect Mr. Bloomberg, as a fellow wealthy businessman. They include the ability of a president to keep secret his or her tax returns, to engage in business transactions with foreign governments while in office and to choose not to divest from significant business holdings or place them into a blind trust.
On the main executive power questions, the answers provided by Mr. Bloomberg generally followed a pattern. He made strong gestures toward obeying norms of presidential self-restraint, not abusing power, and being reluctant to act based on extraordinary claims of executive power. But he also often left himself flexibility rather than unequivocally declaring steps to be legally off limits.
"The answers seem crafted to avoid raising any red flags for Democrats who have been repelled by the Trump administration's claims of presidential authority -- even if the answers don't categorically refer to certain problematic past uses of executive power as unlawful," said Peter M. Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and co-author of a separation-of-powers casebook.
For example, Mr. Bloomberg said he would be "extremely concerned" about detaining an American citizen, arrested on domestic soil, in military custody as an enemy combatant rather than in the civilian criminal justice system -- as the Bush administration did after the Sept. 11 attacks. But he stopped short of saying the Constitution would never let him do so.
Similarly, Mr. Bloomberg spoke critically of the practice of presidents issuing "signing statements" deeming parts of bills to be unconstitutional intrusions into their executive powers, even as they sign them into law. He said the right response to a flawed bill "is almost always to veto it, not to sign it and to say that it is unconstitutional." But he reserved the right to use such statements in "very rare circumstances -- which I hope would never arise."
And Mr. Bloomberg largely sidestepped a question about the legitimacy of presidents claiming that their constitutional authority as commander in chief permitted them to lawfully override federal statutes -- as Mr. Bush did in authorizing the National Security Agency and the C.I.A. to bypass legal constraints on surveillance and torture, and Mr. Obama did in transferring five Guantánamo detainees to Qatar in the Bowe Bergdahl prisoner exchange.
While noting that each of those acts was "expressly contrary to acts of Congress," Mr. Bloomberg did not rule out making a similar claim to bypass a law. Rather, he echoed a famous formulation for analyzing whether and when the president can override a law, by Justice Robert Jackson in a 1952 case striking down President Harry S. Truman's seizure of steel mills.
"As president I would govern by the principle that presidential authority is at its zenith when authorized by both the Constitution and acts of Congress, and is at its weakest and riskiest when contrary to an act of Congress but somehow authorized by a broad reading of the Constitution," Mr. Bloomberg wrote.
But he explicitly approved a disputed claim by the Obama administration legal team that it was lawful for Mr. Obama to order a drone strike that targeted and killed an American citizen in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who had received no trial but had been deemed by executive branch officials to be an operational terrorist leader whose capture was infeasible.
Mr. Bloomberg wrote that he "would have no hesitation to authorize lethal force" against someone like Mr. al-Awlaki.
Like several other Democratic candidates, Mr. Bloomberg criticized Attorney General William P. Barr, who is known for his maximalist interpretation of executive power, saying that he rejected "the current attorney general's view of presidential authority."
In particular, like many Democratic candidates, he spurned Mr. Barr's view that obstruction-of-justice laws do not apply to a president who abuses his authority over the Justice Department in order to corruptly impede an investigation.
Mr. Bloomberg did not say whether he would maintain novel Espionage Act charges brought by Mr. Barr's Justice Department against Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, for soliciting, acquiring and publishing classified government secrets. Those are common acts for investigative journalism, whether or not Mr. Assange counts as a "journalist."
But Mr. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News, otherwise issued a robust endorsement of press freedoms at a time when recent administrations of both parties have cracked down on leaks and Mr. Trump has regularly tarred reporters as "the enemy of the people."
Mr. Bloomberg pledged to vigorously protect the First Amendments rights of speech and press freedoms, saying they "are not negotiable."
"They cannot be compromised," he continued. "To me, the press is the friend of the people. Without commenting on particular cases, I would adopt a very strong presumption against any criminal cases against journalists."

Texto completo: The coronavirus epidemic prompted China to permanently ban trade of wild animals as food, but not for medicinal use.
China this week announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption that international conservationists greeted as a major step, but one with troublesome loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.
A wild animal market in Wuhan may have been where the outbreak of Covid-19 began, and pangolins, in particular, have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.
China had already banned the wildlife markets. The action on Monday by a standing committee of the 13th National People's Congress went further. The decision on "Comprehensively Prohibiting the Illegal Trade of Wild Animals, Eliminating the Bad Habits of Wild Animal Consumption, and Protecting the Health and Safety of the People," bans all trade and eating of non-aquatic wild animals.
But, according to an analysis by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the decision does not ban trade for fur, medicine or research. "This creates a potential loophole for traffickers who may exploit the nonfood exemptions to sell or trade live wildlife," the group said in a statement.
Christian Walzer, the society's chief global veterinarian, said the new ban "is a big step in the right direction." The ban goes to the "root cause" of the Covid-19 outbreak, he said which he and most other scientists view as human harvesting of wild animals.
"But there is a huge trade in wildlife that is not related to consumption," he said. In the case of pangolins, the scales are used by the ton in traditional medicine. The Chinese government controls the trade, but there is still room for illegal activity.
Daniel Challender, a researcher at the University of Oxford who has studied the pangolin trade, said the new decision made clear that China was "going to clamp down on pangolin meat." But, he said, attempts to breed pangolins for medicinal purposes appear to be exempt.

Texto completo: Now we have Placido Domingo's "apology." And, as of Thursday, its "correction."
Last summer, when two Associated Press stories recounted allegations by 20 women that they had been groped, kissed, sexually badgered and harassed by Domingo who used his unique position of influence to coerce meetings and silence any complaint, Domingo's spokeswoman responded by saying that the "campaign by the AP to denigrate Placido Domingo is not only inaccurate but unethical," that the claims were riddled with inconsistencies" and "in many ways, simply incorrect."
Earlier this week, however, the world-renowned tenor changed his tune.

Sort of.
Hours before the announcement Tuesday that an investigation by the American Guild of Musical Artists concluded that Domingo had, for 20 years, engaged in a pattern of "inappropriate activity" -- and that many witnesses had kept silent for years in "fear of retaliation" -- Domingo decided that he was, after all, very sorry.
Or as his statement read: "I have taken time over the last several months to reflect on the allegations that various colleagues of mine have made against me. I respect that these women finally felt comfortable enough to speak out, and I want them to know that I am truly sorry for the hurt that I caused them.
"I accept full responsibility for my actions, and I have grown from this experience. I understand now that some women may have feared expressing themselves honestly because of a concern that their careers would be adversely affected if they did so. While that was never my intention, no one should ever be made to feel that way.
"I am committed to affecting positive change in the opera industry so that no one else has to have that same experience. It is my fervent wish that the result will be a safer place to work for all in the opera industry, and I hope that my example moving forward will encourage others to follow."
Two days later, however, after the Spanish government had canceled one of his upcoming performances and as other European opera houses, including Madrid's Teatro Real, were considering canceling others, Domingo appeared to contradict his own apology. In a second statement he said that although it had been "sincere and whole-hearted," he had "never behaved aggressively toward anybody," nor had he "ever done anything to obstruct or hurt" anyone's career.
He also withdrew from Teatro Real's upcoming performance of "La Traviata," saying that he wished to "prevent my situation from affecting, harming or causing any additional inconvenience."
Honestly, it's enough to make Don Giovanni blush.
If he denies behaving "aggressively" or doing anything to hurt anyone's career, what exactly is he apologizing for? Inconveniencing certain operatic venues? I'm sure we're all relieved to know that Domingo has "grown" from this experience -- that's what it's all about right? -- though exactly what "example" he hopes others will follow is unclear. Deny until necessity forces an apology and then, when it appears that the apology seems to be an admission of wrongdoing, walk it back? Any reflection he has done in the last few months appears to be about how to minimize any damage the accusations will have on his career and legacy.
Although this may be the most blatant example of the "I'm sorry you feel that way" non-apology, Domingo is not the first man who, upon being accused of misconduct by multiple women, began with a semi-self-congratulatory announcement that he had given the matter some thought.
"Realizing" that it is unacceptable to grope, kiss, flash, talk dirty to or masturbate in front of employees, co-workers or any person who is not, by mutual consent, your sexual partner is in fact a signature of far too many #MeToo apologies.
After being accused of sexual harassment by eight women, Charlie Rose said he "learned a great deal as a result of these events, and I hope others will too."
Louis C.K., who spent years vehemently denying rumors that he had masturbated in front of female colleagues, finally non-apologized by saying that he had thought masturbating in front of co-workers was OK because he had asked first, only to learn "later in life ... that when you have power over another person, asking them [to watch you masturbate] isn't a question. It's a predicament for them."
The fact that Domingo believes the "not my intention" argument will still fly is infuriating. As is his insistence that for 20 years he remained serenely unaware of how unwelcome his pattern of uninvited and insinuating advances were to many women, or that they were allowed to continue unchecked because he was Placido Domingo and all that implies.
Indeed, mere hours after it landed, yet another woman, soprano Luz del Alba Rubio, came forward to the Associated Press with another set of accusations. Not surprising, considering that even before its further "I didn't do anything wrong" qualifications, Domingo's apology was a near-letter-perfect example of damage control.
All the boxes checked -- respect (for his accusers), regret (for any hurt he caused them) and repentance (the commitment to "affecting" positive change) -- and signifying nothing. There was absolutely no concrete example of how he was planning to "affect" change. Unless you count the leaked email from the president of the guild reported in the New York Times, about Domingo's lawyers withdrawing an offer of a $500,000 payment to the guild if the group could manage to keep details of the investigation from going public.
Perhaps not the best example of ensuring that the music world become a safer place.
If Domingo were truly sorry for whatever he is actually sorry for, he would put his money where his very famous, and now infamous, mouth is by doing something -- paying the $500 grand anyway, setting up a program to support women at all levels in opera or an initiative to raise consciousness about sexual harassment in the music world.
Or he could spend some time in actual reflection and then offer a more honest apology. For benefiting from and shoring up a system in which power is rewarded and sustained by an ecosystem in which an anointed few have the ability to grant or withhold favors that can impact careers and entire institutions. Professional harassment is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that that system remains controlled by the few, and sexual harassment is the most effective way of ensuring that those few remain mostly men.
Wouldn't it be great if Domingo behaved like an actual maestro and said, "I'm sorry I acted like a complete pig but at some point I started to believe that sexual advances from me would always be welcome. That my talent put me above obvious social niceties and professional decorum, and my ability to make some people rich and other people stars meant I was granted special access to everything including the bodies of women whose careers I could influence. It shouldn't have taken 27, wait, 28 women and a guild investigation to make me understand I can't do whatever I want, but it did and I'm sorry."
There are many conversations to be had about the complicity we all play in creating "stars," whose ugly actions we overlook or justify because of their ability to create exceptional art and beauty, and certainly sex is a force of both creativity and commerce. But using a position of power and influence to gain physical access to people is not sex, it's abuse.
So if you're going to apologize for abusing your power, then apologize for abusing your power. If you're not, then don't.
Either way, as the statue said to Don Giovanni: Ah! Tempo piu non v'e.
Your time is up.

Texto completo: Re "Not embracing this N.Y. theory about L.A.," column, Feb. 26
Steve Lopez's misguided "disgust" about an out-of-touch New York Times article on hugging in Los Angeles pretty much sums up the stereotypes portrayed of Angelenos by New Yorkers.
Have you ever heard New Yorkers (regardless of socioeconomic background) talk about the Times' real estate section? The paper is so otherworldly that my parents once took out an obituary for their dog, and it ran undisputed.

Real New Yorkers read either the Post or the Daily News. Why? Because the Times is too expensive and difficult to read on the train to work.
That said, as a sociologist, artist and urban explorer, I can say that the truth is that "this 'Los Angeles' that the NYT keeps writing about" exists just as much as every other bubble exists in both Los Angeles and New York. Anyone who scratches the surface of either clearly sees that our current interdependence on technology for cultural information has segregated and isolated the population more than it has integrated them.
In my opinion, Lopez's column only stands to further the acceptance of these stereotypes and drive people apart.
Sam Pocker
Los Angeles
::
I enjoyed Lopez's delightful column about hugging in Los Angeles.
My best understanding of L.A. came from a talk that longtime UCLA Chancellor Charles Young gave to new faculty. It was in the 1960s, and I had just been hired as an assistant professor. Young said that Los Angeles does not exist -- it was up to each one of us to create our own Los Angeles.
So when Lopez writes that it is difficult to define Los Angeles in simple terms, it is because it is not just difficult, it is impossible. The wonder of this city is the freedom for each of us to create our own city and the innumerable ways that are open for us to do so.
James Freed

::
I would like to speak up for the anti-huggers.
I had to warn a chap in our social group that his constant attempts to hug me constituted assault, and that, were he to succeed, it would be battery. Perhaps my being a cold, unemotional Englishman has something to do with it.
Richard Jackson
Arroyo Grande
::
There are two certainties about the individual from New York who claimed not to have experienced much hugging in that city: This person is neither Italian nor from Brooklyn.
You only hug a tourist at a wedding or a bar.

Re "Trump says risk from virus 'remains very low' for U.S.," Feb. 27
Seriously? How can Vice President Mike Pence oversee the Trump administration's response to a human health crisis when he has a record on health and safety that is so abysmal?
This is a man who, as governor of Indiana, signed into law an abortion bill that is among the most restrictive in the country. He also permitted discrimination against the LGBTQ community in his state.
But wait, there's more. He tried to block the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Indiana and cut off federal aid to existing refugees -- and he believes in stripping judges of their discretion in drug-crime sentencing. His record as being anti-science is even more chilling.
Perhaps the only good that will come from this appointment and other missteps by the present administration is that President Trump is voted out of office in November.
Randy Farhi
Los Angeles
::
On Wednesday, Trump put Pence in charge of the administration's public health response to the coronavirus.
While governor of Indiana, Pence arranged to make Indiana rank 48th in per-capita public health spending in the United States. What qualifications justify his appointment?

Young voters need 'geezers'
Re "The Democrats' crotchety geezer shtick is wearing thin," Opinion, Feb. 27
Virginia Heffernan's rant against one whole part of the electorate, old white guys like me, rips a page out of President Trump's playbook of divide and conquer. In a time when we need to bridge our differences, this hurts rather than helps our cause.
As a lifelong liberal Democrat who looks forward to building a coalition around any candidate who can beat Trump and restore dignity and sanity to our bruised democracy, I'm thrilled to see people who don't look like me join my party and swell its ranks to carry the torch into the future.
Ms. Heffernan, young people and old geezers are on the same side.
Steven Fernandez
Los Angeles
::
Indeed, Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Bernie Sanders grew up in a very different era from that in which we are now living.
However, the problem is not the age of these men, it is their failure to keep listening, especially to the generation of rising young adults.
Surrounded by like-minded people and highly successful in their middle-age years, they have little motivation or opportunity to change. As we age, moving out of our group and listening to and understanding the younger generation takes increasing effort.
Thus, it is not age that is the problem with "geezers," it is perhaps their former success, their egos and their failure to be vulnerable and learn.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren is not much younger than the geezers, but she is a model of how to stay in touch.
Rachel Levin
Upland
::
Heffernan makes a strange statement about the "crotchety geezer" Democratic candidates: "The mothers of these men came of age without the vote."
I'm a month younger than Bloomberg. My mother was born in 1919. Full suffrage for women was embodied in the Constitution in 1920. Unless the mother of any of these candidates was born in the 1890s, Heffernan's comment seems improbable.
Geezers we may be, but at least some of us can still remember history and do simple arithmetic.
Jan Libourel
Long Beach
::
As a woman nearing 80, I am not the least bit mystified by "reparations, identity politics, trans rights and #MeToo," and neither are my peers.
Hefferman's column was condescending and insulting.
Sing Baker
Carlsbad
::
Are senior citizens the last group that can be openly denigrated without fear of reprisal? I thought The Times frowned on blatant bigotry.

Exhibit A for reporting reform
Re "In defense of Judge Reinhardt," letter, Feb. 26
I was very disappointed to read former U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals executive Cathy A. Catterson's letter to the L.A. Times. It shouldn't be surprising that law clerks and staff are reluctant to report harassment when those at the very top are so reflexively defensive of accused judges.
If Catterson's views are shared by others in court administration (and she suggests they are), then we can't trust the courts to reform themselves.
And to date, they really haven't. Instead, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has just offered "window dressing"-type changes that don't make a material difference in reporting and addressing judges' misconduct.
Congress must act, and it should force court administration reforms despite institutional inertia and some judges' resistance to greater oversight.
Catterson claims that the late Judge Stephen Reinhardt's "bark" was worse than his "bite," despite acknowledging that she had no personal knowledge regarding his alleged misconduct toward his clerk. A circuit judge's chambers is a small and private place -- a place where vicious "bites" could be delivered frequently, and without much, if any, notice outside.
That is exactly why the reporting system must be strengthened.

CORONAVIRUS THREAT; Lawmakers demand answers on virus; Congressional critics press health officials on the COVID-19 response and troubles with testing kits.

Texto completo: Fearful that more Americans may have coronavirus than is known, senior Trump administration officials told Congress on Thursday they are speeding distribution of testing kits to better assess the risk of a widespread outbreak in the United States.
But the assurances from Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services, did not quell lawmakers' criticism that the White House hasn't adequately prepared for a potential public health crisis.
And several Democrats raised concerns that Azar's department did not adequately train or provide necessary protective gear to health workers sent to assist Americans flown back from coronavirus hot zones in China and elsewhere last month and quarantined at Travis Air Force Base and March Air Reserve Base in California.

The accusations of improper safety protocols, including allowing the health workers to leave the bases, were outlined in a whistleblower complaint from an unidentified official in the Health and Human Services Department. In a statement, the department said it was "evaluating the complaint."
Further roiling Washington was a White House move to channel all public comments by federal health officials through the vice president's office. It stoked new concerns that President Trump and his deputies are seeking to withhold crucial information for partisan purposes.
"The American people do not need or want uninformed opinions or spin from its leaders," Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday. "They want the truth."
Democrats hammered administration officials at two congressional hearings Thursday, demanding more details on the public health response.
Those demands took on urgency after officials confirmed that a woman in Northern California with coronavirus was not tested for more than week after she was admitted to the UC Davis Medical Center.
Wider spread of coronavirus "could have begun yesterday," Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) angrily told Azar, who testified at a budget hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee.
"The question is whether the administration is moving based on this serious concern, or just putting a happy face on all this, [hoping] it will all go away when the spring flowers come out," Doggett said.
Azar insisted the administration response was well orchestrated and denied any knowledge of inadequate safety procedures at the California military bases.
Testifying before a House foreign affairs subcommittee, Dr. Robert Redfield, who heads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, sought to strike a balance between reassurance and vigilance.
He said the CDC assesses that the risk of infection "remains low," but the agency anticipates more so-called community cases, like the patient in California who told authorities she had not traveled abroad or been exposed to someone with the virus.
At this point, her case is the first known infection that was transmitted from an unknown source in the United States. But the extent of community transmission remains a mystery since U.S. public health officials have had limited ability to track the disease.
Lawmakers expressed concern about delays in getting effective testing kits to laboratories around the country after defects with existing lab kits came to light, forcing labs to put testing on hold as the virus spread.
"That was a really, really uncomfortable position to be in," said Scott Becker, who heads the Assn. of Public Health Laboratories, a trade group.
Azar said more than 40 public health laboratories should be able to use a modified test kit for the new coronavirus, known as COVID-19. He said another test could be sent to 93 public health labs "as soon as Monday."
There were other signs of progress Thursday.
Vice President Mike Pence, whom Trump named Wednesday as his coronavirus response coordinator, appointed Dr. Deborah L. Birx, an expert on HIV/AIDS, to a coronavirus task force, a move that drew bipartisan praise.
Birx, a diplomat who oversees U.S. efforts to combat HIV/AIDS globally, is a well-respected immunologist who has worked at the Pentagon and the CDC.
On Capitol Hill, senior lawmakers said they are close to a bipartisan deal to boost funding for the public health response, with votes expected as soon as next week.
The final total is likely to be more than $4 billion.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and Schumer warned that Democrats won't support a spending package unless Trump is barred from using the money for anything other than coronavirus. The White House has repeatedly sought to use Defense Department funding to build the president's border wall.
The Democratic leaders also said they would insist any vaccines are affordable and available to all who need it.
The conditions reflect distrust between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration, whose mixed messages about the coronavirus threat have appalled many public health experts.
Exacerbating the mistrust, the White House decided that all public communications on coronavirus by federal agencies would be coordinated by Pence's office, according to an administration official.
Under other circumstances, the effort to control messaging, which was first reported by the New York Times, might draw little criticism since public health experts emphasize the need for clear and consistent communication in a public health crisis.
But Trump's record of attacking scientists and experts and his efforts to downplay the coronavirus risks, even as CDC experts sounded more serious warnings, cast the move in a darker light.
"There's nothing wrong with a coordinated process inside the federal government to make sure it is sending out clear, fact-based information," said Dr. Michael Carome, who directs health research at Public Citizen, a leading consumer advocacy group.
"But there's every reason to suspect something else is happening -- that public health experts are being instructed to stay silent because they are sharing truthful information that the Trump administration finds inconvenient," he added.

Texto completo: A boy, 7, died just two days after a girl, 10, was fatally struck by a school bus nearby.
Two crossing guards wearing bright vests stood at the intersection of Blake and Pennsylvania Avenues in Brooklyn on Thursday afternoon as children were dismissed from a nearby school -- a development that some neighbors were surprised to see.
"It took a little kid's life for them to put crossing guards here," said Freddy Ruiz, 55, a resident.
Earlier on Thursday at that same intersection, a boy, 7, was struck and killed by an S.U.V. He was the second child pedestrian killed in three days.
The police said that around 8:30 a.m., the vehicle, a silver Jeep Cherokee, hit the boy, Payson Lott, and his mother, who were in a crosswalk at the intersection, in the East New York neighborhood.
A video shared with The New York Times shows the driver of the Jeep turning right and suddenly hitting the boy and his mother, 39, without halting.
Shortly before 4 p.m., Shadeen Lott, whom neighbors identified as Payson's mother, emerged from a car that pulled up to the building where the family lived. She walked out limping, with a cane, and was accompanied by a man and young girl. They declined to comment as they went inside.
The incident occurred just two days after and just two miles away from where a 10-year-old girl, who was crossing the street on her way to school with her older brother, was fatally struck by a school bus making a right turn.
More than 20 pedestrians have been killed in traffic incidents on New York City streets so far this year, including six since Sunday.
Under Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero plan on street safety, traffic deaths fell to 203 in 2018, their lowest level in a century. But last year, they rose to 221. Pedestrian deaths also increased last year, to 122 from 115 in 2018.
The driver of the vehicle, Susan Pierrot, 48, remained at the scene and was later arrested, the police said. She was charged with aggravated unlicensed operator in the second degree and four counts of failure to yield to a pedestrian -- two involving an injury -- and was cited for multiple traffic infractions, the police said.
The Jeep has at least 42 parking and camera violation tickets in the city dating to 2017, including 10 school-zone speed-camera violations and two violations for failing to stop at a red light, according to How's My Driving NY, a service that compiles public data on parking and camera violations. Thirty-two of these violations were in Brooklyn.
The city is now planning to crack down on the most dangerous drivers, requiring those with multiple speeding or red-light camera violations to take a driving-safety course or risk having their car seized.
Payson was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, the police said, where he died shortly after arriving. His mother was also taken to Brookdale for injuries.
After the accident, police officers rerouted traffic to clear the scene as the authorities examined the Jeep. After the vehicle was towed away, a fire truck washed down the street.
Just steps away from the scene, the boy's orange coat and blue umbrella remained on a curb in front of a community garden.
Wevdi Nasher, the owner of a bodega at the corner of Blake and Pennsylvania Avenues, said the fatality was not a surprise.
"The traffic here is very dangerous; people drive like crazy," Mr. Nasher, 26, said. "I've got to be careful when I go to cross the street."
It is common for children to stop by his store to buy breakfast and snacks, said Mr. Nasher, who was not at work when the boy was struck. The High School for Civil Rights, formerly Thomas Jefferson High School, is close to where the incident happened.
Bruce Thomas, 63, a longtime resident, said reckless driving along that stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue had worsened since last year, when the authorities removed a speed sign that showed drivers how fast they were going.
"Now people see the yellow light," Mr. Thomas said, referring to the traffic light, "and they speed up."
He added that while the speed limit on that street was 25 miles per hour, "people come through here doing 40, 45. It's madness."
The city has red-light cameras installed at 150 intersections and more than 600 speed cameras near schools.
It is unknown if a speed camera captured Thursday's incident; there are several schools within a few blocks of the intersection. But city officials have said that both speed and red-light cameras have made streets safer.
In areas with speed cameras, the number of people killed or injured in crashes has declined by about 20 percent over the past three years.
In a statement, Danny Harris, the executive director with Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, called the pedestrian fatalities a "public health crisis."
"New Yorkers cannot wait weeks, months, or years for safe streets," he said. "We must accelerate our path to Vision Zero today."
On Tuesday, the 10-year-old girl, Patience Albert, was struck by the school bus at around 6:30 a.m. near the Crescent Street and Wortman Avenue intersection, the police said. She was pronounced dead at Brookdale. Her brother, 15, whom the police would not name, suffered a leg injury.
No students had been on the bus, and its driver, Pedro Colon, was taken into custody, officials said. Mr. Colon, 61, was charged with two counts of failure to yield to a pedestrian and two counts of failure to exercise due care.
Also this week, an 88-year-old woman was killed on Sunday while crossing Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens, and a 26-year-old man was fatally struck in a hit-and-run in Brooklyn.
On Monday, a 59-year-old woman died after being struck on a Bronx street, and on Wednesday, a 39-year-old man died after being struck by two vehicles in the Bronx.
In Brooklyn, Payson's neighbors were processing the news of his death on Thursday afternoon.
Aaron Fedii, who lives on Wyona Street, downstairs from the boy, said he saw him and his mother on their way to school every morning. He described Payson as a "cool little dude."
"It's sad," Mr. Fedii, 24, said. "Second time in a week."

Texto completo: The Education Department demanded that the University of Southern California overhaul the way it addresses sexual misconduct charges and offer remedies to the doctor's patients.
WASHINGTON -- Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Thursday an agreement with the University of Southern California that requires the school to overhaul its processes for responding to sexual assaults after the department found "systemic failures" in its response to abuse allegations against a former gynecologist, George Tyndall.
The agreement requires the university to review the actions of current and former employees involved in the Tyndall matter to determine whether they should be disciplined, and to make reasonable efforts to contact and offer remedies to nine patients who may have been harmed over Mr. Tyndall's 31-year medical career, and possibly to others.
The school also agreed to improve training and procedures to deal with complaints filed under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. The department will monitor the school's compliance for three years.
"This total and complete failure to protect students is heartbreaking and inexcusable," Ms. DeVos said in a statement. "Too many at U.S.C. turned a blind eye to evidence that Dr. Tyndall was preying on students for years."
In January, a federal judge in Los Angeles signaled that he was inclined to approve the University of Southern California's $ 215 million class-action settlement with former patients of Mr. Tyndall, who was charged criminally in June 2019 with 29 total counts of sexual penetration and sexual battery. If convicted, he could face up to 53 years in prison. He has denied wrongdoing.
Kenneth L. Marcus, the assistant secretary of education for civil rights, said the investigation was one of the largest that the office had ever conducted. The department initiated the investigation itself, a rare step, in May 2018 based on concerns that had arisen during previous investigations at the school. Investigators reviewed 20,000 pages of documents, interviewed about 95 staff and students, and held a community meeting.
Mr. Marcus said the investigation turned up "extraordinarily egregious" facts in one of the "most shocking cases we've seen." Investigators determined that the university was notified about sexual harassment since at least 2000, and that "its failure may have allowed female students to be subjected to such discrimination for more than a decade."
They found that patients and staff complained that during pelvic examinations, Mr. Tyndall made inappropriate remarks about physical attributes; that he would conduct pelvic exams without gloves; and in 2016, that the university failed to investigate more than 200 photographs of patients' genitals that were discovered in his office.
Carol Folt, the university's president, said in a statement that the agreement reflected its commitment to "work in partnership" with the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights "to further a culture and climate where students, faculty and staff can learn, work and thrive," and that the university had already taken several steps to improve.
"The university is confronting its past and implementing changes necessary to inform its future," Ms. Folt said.
The inquiry was the third large-scale Title IX investigation undertaken under Ms. DeVos. In September, the department hit Michigan State University with a record fine after finding the school failed to protect students from abuse by a former team doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar.
The same month, the department announced a resolution agreement with the Chicago public school system, after finding "widespread" failures to respond to complaints of sexual misconduct by students and staff.
The agreement comes as schools across the country await Ms. DeVos's highly anticipated new rules for how administrators must address and adjudicate complaints of sexual harassment on campuses. On Wednesday, the department announced that it would conduct "nationwide compliance reviews" in the country's K-12 schools where reported assaults, and schools' violations of Title IX obligations, are on the rise.

Texto completo: Fredrick Brennan, who founded the site that has given visibility to violent extremists, gave up control of it in 2015 and has criticized 8chan's current leader.
Fredrick Brennan, who founded but later distanced himself from the 8chan message board that has given encouragement and visibility to violent extremists, is facing arrest in the Philippines in a "cyberlibel" case brought by the site's current owner.
An arrest warrant was issued Thursday in Pasig City, his lawyer, Alex Acain, told Rappler, a news site in the Philippines. Mr. Brennan is currently in the United States, and it was unclear on Thursday if he planned to return to the Philippines, where he lives.
The case stems from Twitter posts Mr. Brennan, who gave up control of 8chan in 2015, directed at Jim Watkins, who took over the site and also lives in the Philippines. Mr. Watkins, whose message board contains unapologetically racist material that has frequently cheered deadly violence, sued Mr. Brennan after tweets that referred to Mr. Watkins as "senile" and called the site's moderators "incompetent."
In the Philippines, cyberlibel is a criminal offense that can be punished with prison time.
In recent years, Mr. Brennan has repeatedly criticized the site and how it has been run. Several mass shooters, including those accused in shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, and El Paso, had posted hate-filled screeds on the forum before their attacks, and been cheered on by the site's users.
Mr. Brennan originally created 8chan to host any legally permissible speech, no matter how toxic, but has since said the site should be shut down.
"I've tried to understand so many times why he keeps it going, and I just don't get it," Mr. Brennan told The New York Times after the El Paso shooting in August. "After Christchurch, after the Tree of Life shooting, and now after this shooting, they think this is all really funny."
The site was shut down in August after several tech companies refused to offer crucial services, but returned online in November under a new name, 8kun.
Mr. Watkins filed the libel complaint against Mr. Brennan in October.
"The exercise of the right of free expression and free speech like any other right enshrined in our Constitution comes with an equal burden of responsible exercise of that right. After all, the recognition of a right is not a free license for the one claiming it to run roughshod over the rights of others," Mr. Watkins said in the complaint, according to Rappler.
Mr. Brennan, who uses a wheelchair, has a condition known as brittle-bone disease. He told CNN Philippines in November that he thought the lawsuit was an attempt to intimidate him.
"I have a serious disability and there's no doubt at all that I would certainly die in prison here," he said.

Fees to Fight Deportation Set to Balloon To 4 Figures

Texto completo: The Justice Department proposal would bring new obstacles to immigrants hoping to win legal status in the United States.
Immigrants who hope to challenge their deportation orders could be charged nearly $ 1,000 to go to court under a proposed new regulation unveiled on Thursday, a nearly tenfold increase that immigration lawyers warn could make deportation appeals much more difficult to pursue.
The new fee schedule is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to speed up deportations and discourage the arrival of immigrants. Under the same proposal, the administration wants to require asylum seekers to pay a $ 50 fee to have their cases heard in court; historically, the asylum process has been available to people fleeing persecution regardless of their ability to pay.
In proposing the new fees, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an arm of the Justice Department, said asking immigrants to pay a greater share of costs would help make sure that court resources were available and would also assure "that U.S. taxpayers do not bear a disproportionate burden in funding the immigration system."
The proposed fees are now open to public comment for a 30-day period. The fees were last increased in 1986, the agency said, and applicants would continue to be able to apply for waivers if they are unable to pay.
But lawyers representing immigrants said the proposed fees, especially those for asylum applicants, could violate the United States' legal obligation to provide immigrants fleeing dangerous conditions to a full and fair hearing.
"I think that new proposed regulation is absolutely outrageous and will have draconian consequences on the ability of noncitizens in removal proceedings to be able to navigate and access the system that Congress put in place for the proceedings," said Trina Realmuto, directing attorney at the American Immigration Council.
The proposed fee for asylum seekers is inconsistent with the concept of welcoming individuals fleeing persecution and torture and amounts to "putting a price tag" on asylum, Ms. Realmuto said.
Another branch of the government, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, has also proposed a sharp increase in fees for immigrants and visa applicants. Fees for permanent residence permits, known as green cards, would increase by $ 990, to a total of $ 2,750, and the cost for naturalization of new citizens would increase by $ 445, to $ 1,170.
Again and again, the Trump administration has made it more expensive to be an immigrant. The price of bonds for release from immigration detention have gone up for many. And on Monday, a rule went into effect that makes it difficult for immigrants to pursue permanent legal status if they have used public benefits, such as Medicaid and food stamps.
Lawyers who work in immigration courts said many of their clients are already deeply worried they will be unable to afford to fight deportation orders, even when they may have substantial justification for staying in the country.
"There's just been a sense of panic," said Matt Adams, legal director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. "For many of our clients, it basically is an insurmountable obstacle."
Immigrants who would be hit hardest by the hike are those in immigration detention, Mr. Adams said. Many were the primary breadwinners in their family before being locked up, and they may not even have the chance to file an appeal, he said.
"It's undermining the very idea of a fair hearing," he said. "It's like, 'You can get a fair hearing, if you have enough money to pay for it."'

Texto completo: In the debate over the possibility of oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, polar bears play an important, if silent, role.
At issue is whether oil development, especially seismic testing to find oil reserves that would be conducted long before any drilling occurred, can be undertaken without harming the animals, which have been hit hard by climate change.
A new study casts doubt on the effectiveness of what is considered a state-of-the-art tool to help industry avoid injuring or disturbing polar bears by detecting their dens in the snow. Over more than a decade on the North Slope of Alaska, the study found, oil companies located fewer than half of the known dens of maternal bears and their infant cubs using airborne instruments called forward-looking infrared, or FLIR, cameras.
"We wanted to make sure that we throw up a cautionary flag," said Tom Smith, a wildlife ecologist at Brigham Young University and the lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal PLOS ONE. The oil industry "needs to acknowledge that even with the best conditions, you're going to miss bears," added Dr. Smith, who is also a scientific adviser to Polar Bears International, a conservation group that provided some of the funding for the study.
Pregnant polar bears dig dens in the snow late in the year and emerge with their cubs the following spring. Undetected dens could be disturbed or even crushed during a seismic survey, in which large trucks traverse the land in a grid pattern, accompanied by movable supply depots and camps for workers.

On the North Slope of Alaska, where oil drilling has been conducted since the 1970s, seismic surveys are only allowed in winter when there is enough snow to protect the delicate Arctic tundra.
FLIR cameras, which are carried by airplanes or helicopters, can detect heat under the snow. But Dr. Smith said weather conditions have to be just right -- not much wind and little moisture -- for the cameras to get good readings.
Other factors, like too much snow cover, can also cause the cameras to miss dens.
"If the snow overlying a den is more than a meter thick, FLIR is not going to see it," Dr. Smith said. "The heat fritters away in the snowbank."
Detection is likely to become more difficult as the Arctic continues to warm under climate change, as warmer air contains more heat-scattering moisture, he said.
Using industry reports of FLIR surveys from 2004 to 2016 and comparing them with on-the-ground documentation of dens across the North Slope, the researchers found that only 45 percent of the 33 dens were located by FLIR cameras. The surveys also produced a number of false positives, because sources like exposed soil and rocks or even discarded steel drums can radiate heat that might be interpreted as signs of a den.
The Arctic refuge is an important denning area for the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation of polar bears, one of the most threatened in the world. Reduction in sea ice coverage, a result of rapid warming in the Arctic, has led to a sharp decline in the population, as it has become more difficult for the bears to reach seals and other food at sea.
The potential harm to the bear population has become a major issue amid the Trump Administration's efforts to allow oil drilling in the Arctic refuge, an area the size of South Carolina that is largely untouched by human activities.
A tax bill passed by Congress in 2017 allowed the Interior Department to develop plans for oil development in a part of the refuge along its northern coast called the 1002 Area. The administration had hoped to begin selling leases last year, despite opposition from Democratic lawmakers, threats of legal action by environmental groups and uncertainty about how much oil underlies the area. A New York Times investigation uncovered evidence that the only oil well ever allowed in the refuge, one that was drilled in the mid 1980s to look for signs of oil reserves, had disappointing results.
Lease sales were never conducted and the administration's plan remains stalled. An environmental impact statement, required before sales can be held, has been prepared by the Interior Department but no final decision has been made.
Lesli Ellis-Wouters, a spokeswoman in Alaska for the Bureau of Land Management, the Interior agency that is managing the development of the leasing plan, said it was not uncommon for a final decision on an impact statement to be issued several months after the statement is finished. As for the status of the lease sales, she added, "By law, the first lease sale is required to occur before December 2021 and we are well within that time frame."
A proposal for a seismic survey in the 1002 Area is also stalled. It was developed by SAExploration, a seismic services company based in Houston, and several Alaska Native corporations, and was criticized by environmental groups and even some Interior Department scientists as potentially harmful to polar bears. The department ordered an environmental assessment of the proposal, which is less comprehensive than an environmental impact statement.
Last week, Carol Danko, an Interior spokeswoman, said in an email that the "environmental assessment (EA) application is currently on hold at the preliminary draft stage pending updates to the plan of operations from the proponent."
SAExploration did not respond to a request for comment. The company defaulted on some of its debt last summer and announced that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting practices. The company's chief financial officer was fired and its chief executive resigned.
If a seismic survey does take place in the refuge, another paper, by Interior Department scientists, has suggested ways it could reduce disturbances to polar bears.
The study, published in December in The Journal of Wildlife Management, used computer simulations of survey designs that varied in where and when the seismic trucks rolled, to avoid known denning areas or survey them only after bears have emerged, usually in early March. It found that a survey design with the most specific restrictions on locations and times reduced the number of dens disturbed by more than 90 percent compared with a survey with no restrictions.
Ryan R. Wilson, a biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska and an author of the study, said it showed that "if you provide a lot of extra information, we can go a long way toward mitigating disturbance to polar bears."
The study also showed that FLIR surveys could further reduce impacts on dens. Dr. Wilson said he was aware of the newer study that questions the effectiveness of FLIR surveys, but said his study also took into account their limited effectiveness.
The survey design study is currently open for a 60-day public comment period by the Interior Department, a rare action for an academic paper. Dr. Wilson said he did not know why the paper was opened for comment.
A Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman said that the comment period was "a way for us to make the public aware of the study and receive feedback on how we might apply the model in the field."
An environmental group, Defenders of Wildlife, criticized the decision. "The study clearly shows a problem reconciling oil development and protecting these imperiled polar bears," said Robert Dewey, the organization's vice president for government relations. "The comment period gives industry an opportunity to try and discredit the study."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
EMANUEL AX, LEONIDAS KAVAKOS AND YO-YO MA at Carnegie Hall (March 4, 8 p.m.). The Beethoven survey at Carnegie continues with the first of three concerts from this chamber-music supergroup, all of which feature a cello sonata, a violin sonata and a piano trio: here, the Cello Sonata Op. 102 No. 1, the Violin Sonata Op. 96 and the Piano Trio Op. 1 No. 3. The further concerts are on March 6 and March 8. If you are looking for Beethoven with a bit more grandeur this week, Bernard Labadie conducts the Orchestra of St. Luke's at Carnegie in works including the "Choral Fantasy" and the Mass in C, with Jeremy Denk as the pianist and Karina Gauvin among the vocal soloists (March 5, 8 p.m.).
212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
'DER FLIEGENDE HOLLÄNDER' at the Metropolitan Opera (March 2, 8 p.m.; through March 27). François Girard's production of "Parsifal" made quite the splash when it was introduced in 2013, and it remains one of the most interesting and innovative in the Met's repertoire. What, then, will he make of the first of Wagner's canonical operas? Anja Kampe sings Senta opposite the Dutchman of Evgeny Nikitin, with a strong cast filled out by Franz-Josef Selig as Daland, Mihoko Fujimura as Mary, Sergey Skorokhodov as Erik and David Portillo as the Steersman. Valery Gergiev, for better or worse, is on the podium for all but the last two performances.
212-362-6000, metopera.org
DAI FUJIKURA at Miller Theater (March 5, 8 p.m.). Thanks to the advocacy of the International Contemporary Ensemble, who appear here, Fujikura's sound world is quite familiar in New York, so this composer portrait is an opportunity to dig deeper into his music. Daniela Candillari conducts a program of five chamber works, including "Gliding Wings," receiving its premiere.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
MISSY MAZZOLI AND KELLY MORAN at Merkin Hall (Feb. 29, 7:30 p.m.). Mazzoli may have built much of her reputation on the back of operas like "Proving Up" and "Breaking the Waves," but her writing at a smaller scale is rewarding, too. Appearing in the Ecstatic Music series, she performs solo works; pieces with the violinist Olivia De Prato; and the premiere of "The Night Ahead and No Real Fate," for piano four-hands and electronics. Mazzoli is joined for that premiere by Moran, a composer and performer whose albums have garnered acclaim from both pop and classical critics in The Times. She sings songs from the album "Ultraviolet," and plays, with Mazzoli, in the premiere of "Don't Trust Mirrors," for two pianos, one prepared.
212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (March 5, 7:30 p.m.; through March 10). Louis Langrée, a familiar figure at Lincoln Center for his oversight of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, conducts the Philharmonic in a program heavy on fin-de-siècle lushness: Debussy's "Nocturnes" and "Préludes à l'après-midi d'un faune," Scriabin's "Le Poème de l'extase" and Ravel's "Shéhérazade," with the mezzo-soprano Isabel Leonard.
212-875-5656, nyphil.org
YUJA WANG at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 28, 8 p.m.). An ambitious program from a pianist whose technical gifts are never in doubt. The first half cleverly connects character pieces by different composers through their similar keys, jumping from Galuppi and Bach to Brahms and Chopin; the second stays firmly in Wang's late-Romantic specialty, with two sonatas by Scriabin framing works by Ravel, Mompou and Berg. Wang is not the only young pianistic hotshot giving a recital this week, but Daniil Trifonov's all-Bach recital at Alice Tully Hall (Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.) is sold out; good luck finding a ticket.

Texto completo: A reader cites the vice president's response to previous health emergencies like AIDS, when he urged prayer.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Taps Pence to Lead Response as Virus Spreads" (front page, Feb. 27):
Why should we be worried by President Trump's naming Vice President Mike Pence to coordinate the government's response to the coronavirus? Mr. Pence has an established and proven record in the scientific field.
Many of us remember that Mr. Pence wrote: "Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill." He is also a longtime climate change denier. And, of course, he has denigrated the theory of evolution while championing creationism.
As governor of Indiana, when H.I.V. started its rampage, Mr. Pence's proposed solution was to have those seeking assistance change their sexual behavior. He initially refused to open needle exchange programs to stop the spread of the virus. Instead, he said the most important thing we can do is "pray."
Mike Pence has succeeded already, because that is exactly what I am doing now. Not only for myself and my family but for my country.

4 Cellphone Carriers May Face $200 Million in Fines for Selling Location Data

Texto completo: The Federal Communications Commission is set to propose about $ 200 million in fines against four major cellphone carriers for selling customers' real-time location data, according to three people briefed on the discussions.
The penalties would be some of the largest the agency has imposed in decades and represent the first action it has taken on the issue, though privacy advocates and critics in Congress say even that response is inadequate. The amount is not final, and the companies -- AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon -- will have the opportunity to respond and argue against the fines.
The trade in location data has emerged as a sensitive privacy issue because it affects hundreds of millions of people and can reveal intimate details about their lives, including personal relationships and visits to doctors. "It puts the safety and privacy of every American with a wireless phone at risk," Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C., said in a statement last month about the agency's investigation.
Sale of the data is widespread among app makers and other technology companies, but the telecommunications sector is subject to more stringent laws protecting customers' confidentiality.
Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, said in a letter to the House Commerce Committee last month that "one or more wireless carriers apparently violated federal law," but it was unclear at that time what penalty his agency would suggest.
The F.C.C., scheduled to have a public meeting on Friday, has not yet made its proposal official but has the necessary votes, said the three people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Agency officials declined to comment until the final vote was announced. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that the F.C.C. would be seeking fines in the case.
The investigation began after articles in The New York Times and elsewhere showed how carriers' deals with companies called location aggregators posed privacy risks. The Times in 2018 reported that the data was eventually making its way to law enforcement, including to an official who was charged with using it to track people without a warrant.
Location data from cellphone carriers proved valuable because it was consistently available and included almost every American with a mobile phone. Carriers sold access to it for marketing purposes and services like bank fraud protection, under contracts that required location companies to get customers' consent, for example by responding to a text message or pressing a button on an app.
But the companies did not always obey those contracts and the carriers had little way of enforcing them, allowing troves of personal information to be used in ways consumers had never intended. The F.C.C. found that the cellphone companies had broken federal law by being negligent with the data.
After the 2018 article and questions from lawmakers, the carriers pledged publicly to limit sales of the data, saying they would wind down their existing contracts with location aggregators. But a report in 2019 showed the data was still available to bounty hunters and others.
Later that year, the companies said in response to questions from an F.C.C. commissioner that they had stopped the practice.
The continued sale of data was the impetus behind the penalties, which amount to tens of millions of dollars for each carrier, people familiar with the matter said. The F.C.C. is fining companies based on the number of days the practice carried on.
"I am committed to ensuring that all entities subject to our jurisdiction comply" with the law and the F.C.C.'s rules, Mr. Pai said in his letter to lawmakers.
But the time between the initial 2018 report and the proposed penalties, and the expected size of the fines, has raised the ire of privacy hawks. One Democratic commissioner, Geoffrey Starks, wrote an opinion piece in The Times last year complaining that "nearly a year after the news first broke, the commission has yet to issue an enforcement action or fine those responsible."
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who first raised concerns about the data sharing and has repeatedly questioned the companies and the F.C.C. over the issue, said in a statement on Thursday that the chairman "only investigated after public pressure mounted."
He said the fines were "comically inadequate" to deter future privacy violations.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'COAL COUNTRY' at the Public Theater (in previews; opens on March 3). In 2010, a thousand feet underground in West Virginia, coal dust exploded, killing 29 of the 31 miners on site. The documentary playwrights Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen interviewed survivors and family members, learning how a community reckons with disaster and loss. Steve Earle supplies original music. Blank directs a cast that includes Mary Bacon and Michael Laurence.
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'COMPANY' at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater (previews start on March 2; opens on March 22). Phone rings, door chimes and in comes a gender-bent version of the beloved Stephen Sondheim musical, with a book by George Furth. Marianne Elliot's production, which originated in London, arrives with the Tony-winner Katrina Lenk as the bachelorette Bobbie, with Patti LuPone as the heavy-drinking, heavy-singing Joanne.
212-239-6200, companymusical.com
'DIANA: A TRUE MUSICAL STORY' at the Longacre Theater (previews start on March 2; opens on March 31). The people's princess comes to New York. Joe DiPietro and David Bryan's musical, which debuted at La Jolla Playhouse, recreates the not-so-happily-ever-after fairytale of Prince Charles (Roe Hartrampf) and Princess Di (Jeanna de Waal). With Judy Kaye as Elizabeth II. Christopher Ashley directs, with choreography by Kelly Devine.
212-239-6200, thedianamusical.com
'THE FRE' at the Flea Theater (previews start on Feb. 28; opens on March 15). Having brought a dancing-penis kickline to Broadway, Taylor Mac has now sunk low. In this new work, set in and around a mud pit, a young aesthete tries to persuade his grubby hedonists to de-ooze. In this show, directed by Niegel Smith, "audiences will literally and figuratively jump into the mud," the theater warns.
212-226-0051, theflea.org
'GIRL FROM THE NORTH COUNTRY' at the Belasco Theater (in previews; opens on March 5). This Bob Dylan jukebox musical, written and directed by Conor McPherson, now knocks on Broadway's door. Set in a boardinghouse in Duluth, Minn., in 1934, it centers on various down-at-heart, down-at-heel residents. Ben Brantley wrote, "What's created, through songs written by Mr. Dylan over half a century, is a climate of feeling, as pervasive and evasive as fog."
212-239-6200, northcountryonbroadway.com

'GRAND HORIZONS' at the Hayes Theater (closes on March 1). Bess Wohl's comedy of divorce, directed by Leigh Silverman, calls it quits. Jesse Green questioned the wisdom of writing "a boulevard comedy for a cul-de-sac age." However, he had particular praise for Jane Alexander, writing that "you haven't lived until you've heard a woman who once played Eleanor Roosevelt sing the praises of cunnilingus."

Texto completo: Airports, often hemmed in by neighborhoods, highways or water, already struggle to keep up with the rising number of air travelers. And the number is expected to keep going up - to more than 7 billion globally by 2035, an airline trade association says, nearly doubling from 2016.
So while airports are expanding their physical facilities where they can, governments and the travel industry are leaning more heavily on technology, especially artificial intelligence, to process more air travelers more quickly.
The airports in Osaka, Japan, and Abu Dhabi have tested autonomous check-in kiosks that move themselves to help manage peaks of passenger flow.
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Miami International Airport are among those using visual sensors to monitor passenger line lengths and how quickly people are moving through security checkpoints.
Managers can use the information to adjust where they need more workers and to send passengers to shorter lines. Passengers can see how long their wait will be on signs or on a phone app. The goal is to help reduce travelers' worries about whether they are going to make their flight.
For international flights, more airlines are installing what are known as self-boarding gates that use a photo station to take and compare a photo of the traveler with the picture in the person's passport and other photos in Customs and Border Protection files. The gates, which are using facial recognition technology, replace agents who check boarding passes and identification cards.
Seven percent of airlines have installed some self-boarding gates, and about a third of all airlines plan to use some type of this gate by the end of 2022, according to SITA, a technology company serving about 450 airports and airlines.
Sherry Stein, head of technology strategy for SITA, said the goals are to reduce hassle for passengers, speed boarding and increase security.
Still, there are privacy concerns over the use of the photos. The general public doesn't receive much information about how the photos will be used or stored, said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle.
Technology similar to that used in self-boarding gates is being deployed for some foreign passengers arriving in the United States.
Miami International Airport, for example, began using facial recognition screening at its facility for international passenger arrivals in 2018.
Travelers who have been to the United States previously step up to facial recognition stations, and a customs official checks their passports to make sure they are valid. First-time visitors still need to present a passport or visa and agree to have their fingerprints and photos taken.
Some of the new technology is aimed at easing language difficulties. Kennedy International Airport in New York recently installed three AI-based real-time translation devices from Google at information stations around the airport.
Travelers choose their language from a counter-mounted screen and ask their questions aloud to the device. The device repeats the question in English to the person at the station. That person responds in English, and the device translates that aloud to the travelers.
Artificial intelligence software can also make a difference with rebooking algorithms, Etzioni said. When weather or mechanical issues disrupt travel, the airlines' speed in recomputing, rerouting and rescheduling matters, he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's visit to India included a state dinner, tens of thousands of cheering onlookers and even a marching band on camels - but a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India was notably absent.
For the second time since September, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India visited the United States, the two countries have failed to reach even a limited "mini-deal" that would increase trade for focused groups of goods, like dairy products, medical devices and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
Negotiators from both countries have been working since 2018 on a deal that would lower Indian barriers to some American products, and restore India's access to a program that allows goods to enter the United States tariff-free.
But the breakdown in negotiations illustrates the steep challenge in reaching a trade deal between two countries headed by populist leaders who harbor suspicions of multilateral arrangements. Both Trump and Modi want to protect jobs in their own countries by fending off foreign competitors - shared attributes that make it even more difficult to strike a comprehensive agreement that would roll back trade barriers more broadly.
"Both sides are attuned to their own political imperatives and not where the other side might have an area of accommodation," said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S. India Business Council, who served as assistant secretary of state for Central and South Asia during the Obama administration. "It is hard, then, to find where the common ground is where a deal could be struck."
In appearances alongside Modi on Tuesday, Trump touted an agreement by India to purchase more than $3 billion of U.S. military equipment, as well as other purchasing agreements related to commercial airlines and natural gas.
But urgency toward a deal appears to have faded, with both leaders appearing content for trade barriers to continue. Trump has said he is focused on a larger agreement that could be reached at the end of this year, if the two sides can find common ground.
That may not be easy. During his visit, the president reiterated his previous complaints about India's high tariffs on American products, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and other goods.
"We're being charged large amounts of tariffs, and you can't do that," Trump said. "I just said that's unfair, and we're working it out."
Since trade talks began, both the United States and India have escalated tensions by ratcheting up tariffs and trade barriers, rather than lowering them.
In March 2018, Trump included India in the list of countries that would be hit by his steel and aluminum tariffs. India responded with retaliatory tariffs on American almonds, apples and other goods. Last May, the Trump administration stripped India of a special status that exempted billions of dollars of its exports into the United States from tariffs.

Texto completo: Jean Daniel, a leading intellectual of the French left whose cameos in history included a trip to Cuba in 1963, where he extended to Fidel Castro a tentative overture from President John F. Kennedy and learned while dining with the communist leader that Kennedy had been fatally shot, died Feb. 19 at 99.
His death was announced by L'Obs, the weekly newsmagazine that he helped found in 1964 as Le Nouvel Observateur, and where he served as editorial director until 2008. Other details of his death were not immediately available.
Once described by the New York Times as a 'father confessor to French socialism,' Mr. Daniel was one of his country's most prominent journalists for more than half a century " from the Algerian war for independence in the 1950s and early 1960s to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that strained relations between the French and American governments.
On those events, and on nearly every major intervening world affair, Mr. Daniel could be counted on for trenchant commentary, if not also for his participation at the side of their protagonists.
He resided at the 'center of the French intellectual political life,' said Alain Minc, a former director of Le Nouvel Observateur, with a social circle that included the philosophers Albert Camus ('For 50 years, I couldn't think without him,' Mr. Daniel commented), Jean-Paul Sartre, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, as well as political leaders including Pierre Mendès-France and François Mitterrand of France, Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria and David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres of Israel.
Mr. Daniel 'has played a role in French political society that has no equivalent in American letters, with the possible exception of Walter Lippmann,' journalist Adam Shatz wrote in the New York Review of Books in 2005.
'He has not only reported on some of the major conflicts of his time " the French-Algerian war, the Congo, the Cold War, the question of Israel-Palestine,' Shatz continued, but 'he has earned the trust and respect of statesmen . . . without sacrificing his independence as a commentator.'
Mr. Daniel began his journalistic career in 1954 with the weekly magazine L'Express, which dispatched him to Algeria to cover the armed conflict in which the French colony ultimately achieved its independence. He took a bullet to the thigh while reporting on the battle over the French military base of Bizerte, in neighboring Tunisia, in 1961.
Mr. Daniel, who was born in Algeria, supported the cause of independence, but not in unqualified fashion. 'As an Algerian-born Jew,' Shatz wrote, 'he also understood that the aim of Algeria's rebels was not to establish a revolutionary socialist republic but to resurrect the country's long-repressed Arab and Muslim identity.'
But in the seemingly in trac table Arab-Israeli conflict, Mr. Daniel supported the Jewish state while also defending Palestinian rights.
'He occupies a position that is both deeply honest and increasingly difficult, in no small part because each side demands unconditional loyalty,' David Kaufmann, a George Mason University literature professor, wrote in the publication Forward in a review of Mr. Daniel's book 'The Jewish Prison: A Rebellious Meditation on the State of Judaism.'
'He bridles at any claim that his identification as a Jew should trump his other commitments,' Kaufmann wrote. 'He is, he maintains, as much a Frenchman as a Jew and, above all else, a human. Indeed, at certain points in this book he seems to reject the very notion of identity itself as an illegitimate limitation of his liberty.'
Mr. Daniel played perhaps his most noted role in American affairs in the fall of 1963, when Benjamin C. Bradlee, then a journalist with Newsweek magazine and later executive editor of The Washington Post, introduced him to his friend President Kennedy.
A year earlier, in one of the dramatic episodes of the Cold War, the United States had discovered a Soviet buildup of missiles in Cuba, less than 100 miles from the United States. The ensuing confrontation, known as the Cuban missile crisis, brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.
Informed by Bradlee that Mr. Daniel was on his way to Cuba for a reporting trip, Kennedy agreed to meet with Mr. Daniel on Oct.-24, 1963. They convened in the Oval Office " the president seated in his rocking chair and Mr. Daniel on a couch " where Kennedy gave Mr. Daniel a message for Castro.
That message, Mr. Daniel later wrote in The Post, was that 'anything is possible with a Cuban nationalist state, even a Communist one' " he recalled that Kennedy cited the positive U.S. relations with communist Yugoslavia " but that 'nothing is possible with a Cuba indentured to the Soviet Union and charged by that country with expanding armed subversion in Central and Latin America.'
Mr. Daniel continued on to Cuba, ultimately meeting with Castro for a wide-ranging colloquy that lasted from 10 p.m. to 4-a.m.
'Fidel listened to me; I mean, he listened to Mr. Kennedy through my voice, with a devouring and passionate interest: twisting his beard, pulling at his parachutist beret, adjusting his maquis jacket, throwing a thousand sparkling malicious lights from the depths of his lively black eyes,' Mr. Daniel wrote in The Post after he returned.
'For a moment, I felt as though I were playing the role of this partner with whom he had as great a desire to discuss as to fight, that I was, in a way, this intimate enemy, this Kennedy of whom [Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev] had said to Fidel, 'With him one can talk.' '
The two men continued their conversation later and were eating lunch at Castro's residence on Varadero Beach on Nov. 22, 1963, when Castro received a phone call. Mr. Daniel, who could hear only one end of the conversation, understood to be of the gravest importance.
' Cómo? Un atentado? ' Castro asked. ('What's that? An assassination attempt?')
Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. In an account published in the New Republic magazine, Mr. Daniel recalled that after Castro hung up, he took his seat again and said three times: ' Es una mala noticia .' ('This is bad news.')
'Everything is changed,' he said. 'Everything is going to change.'
More than 50 years would pass before the United States restored full diplomatic relations with Cuba under President Barack Obama, a policy reversed by President Trump.
Jean Daniel Bensaïd was born on July 21, 1920, in Blida, Algeria, to what Kaufmann described as a 'middle-class and very cosmopolitan family.' He served with the Free French Forces during World War II before studying philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris.
With Camus, Mr. Daniel founded a cultural magazine, called Caliban, before joining L'Express. He was married to Michèle Bancilhon and had a daughter, Sara Daniel, a writer for L'Obs, but a complete list of survivors was not immediately available.
Mr. Daniel wrote regularly for English-language publications including the Times. He was the author of novels as well as nonfiction books, essays, diaries and a memoir, 'Le Temps Qui Reste,' translated as 'The Time That Remains.'
Although a self-described 'committed leftist,' Mr. Daniel was widely known for his eloquent opposition to communism. But even there, his convictions were characterized by incisive nuance, the product of a life defined by the most consequential political struggles of the 20th century.
He recalled with tenderness his friendship with his housekeeper's son, a young communist who died fighting Francisco Franco's fascists during the Spanish Civil War. And so, Mr. Daniel remarked, 'I could never bring myself to completely hate Communists.'

Texto completo: Lawrence G. Wallace, a Justice Department official who risked his career over a high-profile discrimination case and went on to argue more Supreme Court cases than any lawyer in the modern era, died Feb.-13 at a hospital in Rockville, Md. He was 88.
The cause was complications from surgery, said his nephew, Eric Menter.
As a deputy solicitor general under eight presidents, Mr. Wallace represented the U.S. government before the nation's highest court, delivering oral arguments in an elegant style that he likened to his after-hours performances as a violinist. 'I sometimes argue in sonata form, sometimes in theme and variations,' said Mr. Wallace, who played with local groups and in an informal ensemble featuring Condoleezza Rice, a former secretary of state.
Mr. Wallace appeared at the Supreme Court with such frequency that his oral arguments were tallied up by reporters and historians, who tracked his rise through the record books as he passed two recent giants of Supreme Court advocacy, Erwin N. Griswold and John W. Davis. By the time he retired in 2003, he had argued 157 Supreme Court cases, more than any civil servant in U.S. history and more than any lawyer in the 20th-century.
His legal work addressed subjects ranging from radioactive waste and sexually explicit television programming to civil rights and patent law. But among his peers, he was best known for an episode that nearly derailed his career, when he resisted pressure from Justice Department officials in a politically charged case involving racial discrimination and the Internal Revenue Service.
'It really was a remarkable thing,' said Richard J. Lazarus, a Harvard Law professor who served as a former assistant to the solicitor general. ' It was a career civil servant, based on what he viewed as the principle of which arguments had merit, which arguments had integrity, standing up to the attorney general and no less than the White House. . . . The job was his life. He risked being fired in a heartbeat.'
Mr. Wallace's actions took the seemingly undramatic form of a footnote, a short passage he wrote in a 1982 brief filed with the Supreme Court case Bob Jones University v. United States . The case centered on whether the IRS could revoke the tax-exempt status of discriminatory private schools such as Bob Jones University, an evangelical institution in South Carolina that prohibited interracial dating and marriage.
Under normal circumstances, such a high-profile case would have been handled by the solicitor general, Rex E. Lee. But when Lee recused himself, citing previous work on tax exemptions for religious schools, the case fell to his senior deputy, Mr. Wallace, who filed a brief arguing that the IRS could revoke the exemptions.
President Ronald Reagan ultimately took the opposite position, siding with Bob Jones amid a broader break with established civil rights policies. When Mr. Wallace was asked to sign a Supreme Court brief in which the government effectively reversed itself, he included a footnote on the first page noting his disagreement with the administration's position.
A New York Times report called Mr. Wallace's footnote 'one of the more extraordinary twists in a case that is without parallel in recent Supreme Court history.' While he declined to explain why he signed the brief even though he disagreed with its argument, colleagues said that it would have been extremely unusual for the Justice Department to file such a document without the signature of someone from the solicitor general's office.
Griswold, a solicitor general under the Johnson and Nixon administrations, told The Washington Post in 1982 that he thought Mr. Wallace's actions were 'an attempt to preserve the credibility of the office.' Those comments were echoed by Andrew L. Frey, a fellow deputy solicitor general who is now senior counsel at the firm Mayer Brown.
Mr. Wallace, he said in an interview, 'felt the obligation of the Justice Department was to defend the IRS, not to reject its position. It was not a matter of his personal view, although I'm sure his personal view agreed with the IRS. It was a matter of his sense of what the obligation of the office was.'
In 1983, the Supreme Court effectively ruled for the IRS, 8 to 1, with Chief Justice Warren E. Burger writing, 'There can no longer be any doubt that racial discrimination in education violates deeply and widely accepted views of elementary justice.' The Justice Department also created a new position in the solicitor general's office, allowing a political appointee to take the reins as the government's chief advocate if necessary.
In an interview, Lazarus compared Mr. Wallace's actions to those of the four career prosecutors who recently withdrew from the Roger Stone case, after officials moved to undercut their sentencing recommendations for President Trump's longtime confidant.
'There's a political volatility to our times,' he said, 'but what Wallace did was orders of magnitude of a larger dimension: a big case for the Supreme Court' involving 'the constitutionality of a federal policy against racial discrimination' and 'telling the U.S. Supreme Court what the executive branch thinks of the law.'
Lawrence Gerald Wallace was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on March 25, 1931. His father was a real estate broker, his mother a homemaker.
Mr. Wallace studied at Syracuse University, receiving a bachelor's degree in economics in 1952 and a master of public administration in 1954, when he was serving in the Air Force. Five years later, he graduated from Columbia Law School, where he was editor in chief of the law review.
After trying private practice, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black and served on the Duke Law faculty. He was hired to the solicitor general's office in 1968 and promoted to deputy two years later.
Mr. Wallace, who said he honed his Supreme Court arguments over long walks, avoided the standard practice of prepping for cases through 'moot court' sessions with stand-in justices. He didn't want to peak too soon, he said, and for the most part, his technique seemed to work. When Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. retired from the court in 1987, he wrote to Mr. Wallace saying that he 'will miss your arguments. They rank among the very best the court hears.'
On some occasions, however, Mr. Wallace was criticized for unspooling his position too slowly. A 1997 copyright case that marked his 141st oral argument, and that was reported to have broken Davis's modern record, was particularly fraught. Mr. Wallace said he had forgotten to include a key provision in the government's brief, and he was pummeled with questions from the justices.
Nonetheless, he was honored later that day in a celebration led by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and attended by four of the justices. 'I'm rather amazed that it has happened,' Mr. Wallace told The Washington Post. 'The cases just add up on their own. But I've been privileged to touch upon some history.'
According to the Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law, Mr. Wallace's Supreme Court record is dwarfed only by two 19th-century advocates: Daniel Webster, who argued somewhere between 168 and 249 cases, and Walter Jones, who reportedly argued 317. A current deputy solicitor general, Edwin Kneedler, is closing in on Mr. Wallace's modern record, having argued 143 cases, according to the Supreme Court.
Mr. Wallace, who never married, is survived by a sister.
At his 157th and final Supreme Court argument, for a case involving a Victoria's Secret trademark dispute, Mr. Wallace was honored from the bench by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who congratulated him for 'many years of quality advocacy and devoted service.' He then paused, looked at Mr. Wallace and declared, 'That doesn't mean we are going to rule in your favor.'

Texto completo: One of President Trump's failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts " more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors.
Trump is hardly unique among politicians in overvaluing his expertise. But in dealing with coronavirus, this presidential vanity could be very dangerous. It undermines confidence in financial markets, and it politicizes what should be a nonpartisan, fact-based response to the crisis. At worst, it turns into a search for enemies, foreign and domestic, who are causing these bad events to happen.
Some simple advice for Trump in dealing with coronavirus: Just let the experts speak. You'll look stronger and more presidential for deferring to their wisdom.
We need to remember this week what should have been learned from the 2008-2009 downturn when financial markets were badly stressed. As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke understood it then, the problem was a classic banking panic: Traders didn't trust their counterparties; they didn't know the value of the assets in their portfolios or those of their clients; they were scared and desperate.
Confidence slowly returned when the federal government demonstrated that it could handle the crisis. The Fed hosed the markets with liquidity so that institutions could accommodate high volumes and volatility. The Fed and Treasury signaled that they would be buyers of last resort for institutions in crisis. Congress stood behind the administration, and politics were generally put aside to pass necessary bailout legislation, even in a presidential election year.
Democratic presidential candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have looked back at the 2008-2009 crisis and demonized the financial rescue " arguing that the panic was a function of Wall Street greed. Perhaps more people should have gone to jail for financial misdeeds, but that shouldn't be the main takeaway. The Great Recession is an example of government policy working to stem a crisis.
Coronavirus requires a similar demonstration of good public policy. Trump did a smart thing Wednesday night by inviting medical experts to share the stage at his briefing on coronavirus, including Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They issued clear, measured warnings and practical advice " what the public needs right now. (Unfortunately, according to the New York Times, Fauci has been told by the White House not to comment publicly without approval.)
Also on the podium were Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical lobbyist who heads the Department of Health and Human Services, and Vice President Pence, the former Indiana governor who Trump said would oversee the anti-virus effort. Pence delegated the coordinator role Thursday to Deborah L. Birx, who currently heads HIV and AIDS prevention.
Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner's suggestion that the CDC was 'exaggerating' the threat. 'I think they are,' he said. 'I'd like it to stop.' That unwise comment probably spooked the markets.
The danger of heavy-handed presidential intervention is that it can drive experts underground when their advice is most needed. Sadly, there are some signs that that's been happening with the experts in the intelligence community, which has been pounded by Trump since he took office. The CIA and other agencies are said to be warier of issuing analytical reports for fear they might rile the president.
The chilling effect is clear in the request from the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to deliver this year's 'Worldwide Threat Assessment' testimony in private. Last year, these agencies stated public positions on North Korea and Iran that contradicted Trump, drawing presidential ire. If our truth-tellers get gun-shy, we're all in trouble.
Trump understandably fears that coronavirus " and the sharp market reaction this week " could tarnish what had been a positive economic outlook. Who knows, but the epidemic may indeed push the global economy into recession. Trump will be tempted to play a partisan blame game, bashing the news media for spreading bad news, as he did this week. But he knows better than most that markets go up and down, and artificial fixes don't work.
There's a useful self-restraint mechanism at work here, which Trump ignores at his peril. The more the White House intervenes and tries to displace experts, the more negatively Wall Street is likely to react. Markets will clear when traders feel they have all the information " and public policy is calm, well-managed and fact-based. This is a situation where Trump could truly be his own worst enemy.

Texto completo: THE FOREIGN Intelligence Surveillance Act, adopted in 1978, brought federal government wiretapping and other covert executive branch anti-espionage and anti-terrorism methods under the shared supervision of Congress and the judiciary. This advance for the rule of law was a compromise, reflecting bipartisan consensus that such activities had threatened civil liberties in the 1960s and 1970s and needed reform. A further expansion of government authority under FISA after Sept. 11, 2001, also reflected a bipartisan consensus that the FBI and the National Security Agency needed more latitude to deal with international terrorism.
Two decades later, all of that consensus has collapsed; indeed, divisions on both the purposes and methods of FISA have broken out both within and between the parties. And on March 15, key provisions of the law expire, with unforeseeable consequences both for national security and the cause of FISA reform itself.
FISA reform is a hot topic in part because of a recent report by the Justice Department inspector general that found serious deficiencies in the FBI's handling of the case of Carter Page, an adviser to Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. The report found FBI officials misled, both intentionally and otherwise, judges responsible for approving warrants to surveil Mr. Page for suspected, but never confirmed, Russian connections. The FISA provision under which that flawed process occurred is not, however, one of the three set to expire soon. These are, rather, the ones added in the aftermath of 9/11 that have allowed the government to gather a wide array of phone records (but not the content of calls) at home and abroad. FISA court approval is required, but as critics ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have argued, the mass collection of so much 'metadata' raises privacy concerns. The NSA has recently suspended collection in part because the tangible benefits do not outweigh the costs, which ran to $100 million between 2015 and 2019, according to the New York Times.
House Democratic leaders had planned to adopt a bill deleting authority for that program, while adding civil liberties protections to the warrant application process that was abused against Mr. Page. However, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) scuttled a hearing Wednesday when Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) announced she would seek even more sweeping changes to FISA.
Attorney General William P. Barr has told the Senate he favors a 'clean' reauthorization of the existing statute, followed by administrative steps to correct abuses and more debate on further legislated reforms. Several Republicans in both the House and Senate, meanwhile, are rebelling, joining the call for wider reforms, and claiming the Page fiasco as their rationale. Mr. Trump himself, furious about the 'deep state,' undercut Mr. Barr by hinting, via Twitter, that he sympathizes with those congressional Republicans.
The right answer is some combination of Mr.-Nadler's approach and Mr. Barr's. If the NSA itself no longer finds bulk phone record collection useful, there is no need to keep authority for it on the books. Congress should make that change by March 15, reauthorize the rest of FISA, then make further legislative fixes with due deliberation. That approach might restore consensus. Grandstanding and tweets will not.

Different degree for the campus novel

Texto completo: In his sincere debut novel, 'Real Life,' Brandon Taylor broadens the embrace of the traditional campus novel. His melancholy hero, Wallace, a biochemistry PhD student at an unnamed Midwestern university, is black, Southern, gay, 'chubby, at best.' He's anxious but wry about how his status as an African American in a very white milieu means he continuously has to prove himself, to tolerate racism ('They say the Swedes are the blacks of Scandinavia'), and to be held to a different standard by his colleagues. Meanwhile, he's trying to cope with his father's death, memories of sexual violence and his friends' relationship woes. Over the course of a weekend, the tensions in his life find a lightning rod in his friend Miller, with whom he begins a testy relationship.
What is 'real life' here? Like many first novels, 'Real Life' appears to hew to its author's own experience " Taylor has written in numerous personal essays about being gay and Southern, his abusive upbringing and his experiences of sexual violence. With a boilerplate disclaimer about reading too literally, the parallels between Taylor's life and Wallace's experiences seem clear. In another sense, the title is a dry nod to the putative opposition between academic and 'real' life, as in one character's complaint: 'You wouldn't know the first thing about getting a real job, real health insurance, taxes.'
But it may also point to the insoluble, ineffable, capital-R 'Real' of philosophy. In that sense, one might consider the surface of Taylor's novel to be laid atop roiling, limitless forces " the Black Experience, the Queer Experience " whose undulations are what generate the novel's unanticipated turns. What Wallace experiences as the unknowability of his friends and the inscrutability of his own actions are functions of this kind of Real-ism.
The resulting ambiguities are what give Taylor's writing its strengths: his receptivity to menace in the mundane, subcutaneous sexual vibrations, unconscious motivation. We know through throwaway observations ('The pale interior of Miller's thighs flashed') the direction of Wallace's interest; we feel through his attention to physical detail the threat of male sexuality ('the hard stubble on [Miller's] jaw rasps against Wallace's neck'). Yet his apparent passivity and desire to erase himself through violent sex are in counterpoint to his assertiveness in social situations, the grenades he's willing to throw into his friends' dinner parties. This is the subject of Taylor's book: Wallace's passage into new (real?) life entails a growing rejection of his old lot in favor of a new kind of agency. Like Job, who gives the novel its epigraph, Wallace reaches a point where he just won't take it anymore.

Taylor also deals deftly, through close third-person narration, with what it's like to be different in an overculture. Gently, slyly, he makes a point of noticing 'white people,' undermining the unspoken rule of much realist fiction that race need only be mentioned when it's other than white. Racist tropes are humorously inverted as when, gazing at Wallace's white friends, 'like a trio of pale, upright deer,' the narrator suggests, 'you could be forgiven . . . for thinking them related.' Even the setting is subtly color-coded, from the white university flag to a string of white lights at a party.
Taylor's writing is least successful when it's most self-consciously literary. There are many cliches of the 'inky darkness' variety, clothes and former lives shed 'like skins.' Some of the imagery " 'the innumerable dark hairs of her anger,' 'a great stream of faces,' 'The surface of his hunger was rough, like a cat's tongue' " baffles rather than tickles. The lofty register that intrudes whenever a profound observation threatens " 'There can only ever be a tenuous claim on the lives of others' " detracts from the vernacular panache exhibited elsewhere. There are far too many ominous birds skittering around.
There's also an unevenness in the presentation of character. Miller, seemingly straight before the book starts, is surprisingly comfortable with not just sexual but romantic intimacy with Wallace. Elsewhere, a coy conversation between two gay men about a hookup app ('You know the one') rings false. Some histrionics " Wallace's nervous vomiting; a bigoted feminist ('gay guys always think that they've got the corner on oppression') " may come down to personal taste.
Missteps in style and characterization may be a product of Taylor's desire to give sufficient weight to his themes " as he told the New York Times, he aims to inscribe black and LGBTQ lives into the campus novel genre. Still, the juxtaposition of what he has called 'queer, bucolic malaise' with his critique of academic politics keeps 'Real Life' moving with enough bite to forestall encroaching solemnity. With tighter editing and the autobiographical impulse out of his system, what Taylor does next will be worth watching.

China can fight against the virus or the truth " not both

Texto completo: As the coronavirus spreads around the world, the Chinese government is fighting a war on two fronts: one against the virus itself and one against the truth. Beijing is desperate to protect its own image by shaping the narrative around the virus and its origins. But the time has come for the international community to demand Beijing end its war on the truth so we can work together to contain the epidemic.
Since the beginning of the outbreak, China's strategy has been to silence critics and minimize reporting about the scale of the threat. In late January, the Chinese government brought massive resources to bear to try to contain the virus's spread internally, using draconian measures against its own people that it won't acknowledge. Now, China is focusing on restarting its economy and is therefore claiming the virus is slowing down.
What has been consistent throughout is the Communist Party's determination to control information for its own political purposes. This political agenda has hindered the international community's ability to cooperate on a response and properly protect the rest of the world. This week, Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, whom the government has put forward as a credible expert on the epidemic, claimed at a news conference that the virus has peaked and should be under control by April. He also suggested the virus may not have actually originated in China.
The idea that infection rates in China are going down must be viewed with skepticism, while the notion that the virus originated outside China is not supported by scientific evidence. But both of these claims fit the Chinese leadership's political needs while potentially spreading misinformation that hampers urgent efforts to understand how the virus started and how to stop it.
The international group meant to sort through those questions based on scientific evidence is the World Health Organization. But the WHO has instead become an enabler of Beijing's campaign of disinformation rather than acting to counter it.
'Controlling the story and controlling the narrative continues to be a critical part of the Chinese government's strategy,' said Xiao Qiang, a research scientist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley. 'For the WHO to simply repeat the Chinese narrative, if they are at all knowledgeable about China's political environment, given their responsibilities, is extremely disturbing and damaging.'
The WHO's track record of praising the Chinese government's response, despite available facts, is well established. On Jan. 30, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee (a WHO body) issued a statement praising the Chinese government's 'commitment to transparency.' On Feb. 3, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised China's strategy and credited Beijing for preventing even more cases.
Just this week, as The Post reported, WHO official Bruce Aylward told reporters in Beijing the Chinese government's response could inform other countries. He called it 'impressive,' 'stunning,' 'extraordinary,' 'striking,' 'disciplined' and 'successful.'
Some believe the WHO is simply unwilling to challenge Beijing, its second-largest donor. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard wrote in the Daily Telegraph that many experts have lost patience with the WHO, 'deemed a political captive of Beijing.' Several U.S. senators have publicly called on the WHO to resist Chinese pressure and include Taiwan in its meetings on the epidemic.
In response to questions, a WHO spokesman told me the organization is working closely with Taiwanese officials and that the results of its just-completed joint research mission with Chinese experts and officials inside China will be released in the coming days, including new facts and recommendations.
The WHO may believe it's doing what's necessary to maintain its access and cooperation with the Chinese government. But that compromise comes with a cost not only to its integrity but also to the safety of the rest of us.
'At the first stage, they underplayed the danger of the outbreak,' said Xiao. 'By repeating the phrases of the Chinese officials, they are lending their credibility to the Chinese government, which it does not deserve, and that is misleading the public opinion as well as the governments of other countries.'
U.S. officials, including President Trump, should also resist the temptation to repeat Beijing's rosy assertions and ignore the problems with China's response. The American people should not be given a false sense of security. The truth is, China's self-reporting simply can't be taken at face value.
Beijing is also now attacking international outlets that report uncomfortable information about the crisis from the ground. Last week, Chinese media organ Global Times accused the New York Times of encouraging a 'panic' for reporting that Beijing's response is causing suffering among China's migrant worker population.
The coronavirus response is one of those things on which we must cooperate with China. That means being sensitive to Beijing's equities and concerns. But it also means pushing the Chinese government to display more transparency and honesty than it is accustomed to.
The virus itself is immune to Chinese government propaganda. It is not aware of Taiwan's diplomatic status. It does not care if the stock market goes down. Ending our tolerance of China's efforts to control and manipulate our discussion about the epidemic is a matter of life and death.

Texto completo: The film actress Jean Seberg was a muse and a martyr, first as a teenage discovery, then as the gamin face of the French New Wave and, at the tragically early end of her life, as the victim of FBI intimidation and persecution because of her support of the Black Panther Party. Benedict Andrews's ' Seberg ' focuses on that chapter of the actress's life, when she was making Hollywood films while supporting civil rights causes and being gaslighted by J. Edgar Hoover and his COINTELPRO minions. In the title role, Kristen Stewart doesn't resemble Seberg in the slightest, but she lends pathos to a woman who is simultaneously vulnerable and earnestly fearless. If flights of dramatic license frequently result in some clunky expository sequences (usually involving activist Hakim Jamal, played by Anthony Mackie, and a fictional FBI agent played by Jack O'Connell), 'Seberg's' heart is in the right place, just as the title character's was. Photographed in light, lemony hues by Rachel Morrison and designed within an inch of mid-century kitsch, it often feels as though it's being shot just a few blocks from 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' " without that film's healing revisionism, but with all its desperately sad real-life underpinnings. R. At area theaters. Contains coarse language, sexuality, nudity and some drug use. 102 minutes.

The German film ' Balloon ' is a thriller based on the true story of a daring 1979 attempt to escape from East Berlin via a homemade hot-air balloon. According to the New York Times, the film 'adopts a path so dramatically familiar we can almost predict each twist and fake-out.' Unrated. At Landmark's E Street Cinema. In German with subtitles. 125 minutes.

About ' Guns Akimbo ,' a video-game-inspired action film, Variety says, 'Those wanting to kiss a few brain cells goodbye may enjoy this bombastic, crassly jokey action cartoon with Daniel Radcliffe as a dweeb who finds himself unpleasantly designated a new player in the unsimulated kill-or-die game he's been watching online.'

FCC Probe Finds Mobile Carriers Didn't Safeguard Customer Location Data; AT&amp;T, T-Mobile among companies facing hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, though they will likely fight decision

Texto completo: The Federal Communications Commission is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from the country's top cellphone carriers after officials found the companies failed to safeguard information about customers' real-time locations, according to people familiar with the matter.
The telecommunications regulator in recent weeks informed AT&T Inc., Sprint Corp., T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. of pending notices of apparent liability, the people said. Such notices aren't final, and the companies can still argue they aren't liable or should pay less. It would ultimately fall on the U.S. Justice Department to collect any penalties.
The proposed fines, which could total more than $200 million, are expected to be announced Friday, one of the people said. Last month, FCC chairman Ajit Pai notified members of Congress that an agency investigation had concluded that "one or more" carriers had apparently violated federal law by disclosing real-time location data.
The FCC moved after some of the carriers had continued sharing their subscribers' coordinates even after they told members of Congress they were cutting off the middlemen companies from using their data feeds. Verizon has said it stopped sharing cellular location data in 2018. AT&T and T-Mobile said in early 2019 that they were cutting off some location data sharing.
The top U.S. wireless providers agreed to curb their data sharing after independent reporting found data aggregators were misusing feeds that provided subscribers' real-time locations. Upon request, the carriers would pinpoint specific subscribers and share the result with middlemen companies, which then shared the information with hundreds of other businesses.
Some privacy advocates criticized the FCC action as overdue.
"Consumers have no choice but to share highly private information with a provider about everywhere they go" to obtain cellular service, said Laura Moy, associate director at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law. "Carriers are not allowed to turn around and sell that location information to anyone with a phone number and a few dollars to spend. But this has been a widespread practice, and the FCC has been slow to rein it in."
Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who wrote to carriers in 2018 after the location-sharing partnerships were revealed to ask about their data privacy practices, called the proposed fines inadequate. He said in a tweet that strong privacy legislation was needed.
Cellphone companies need to know their subscribers' coordinates to route calls and data to the right place. That gives them a more consistent view of customers' movements than app developers, which use global positioning systems, Wi-Fi and other data sources that users can shut off through their smartphone settings. Wireless carriers also sell anonymized location data to marketers.
Data aggregators LocationSmart Inc. and Zumigo Inc. told The Wall Street Journal they distributed real-time locations to legitimate clients, including bank fraud-detection departments and roadside assistance services. But others used the data feeds for what the carriers said were unauthorized purposes. One prison phone provider created a website that let law-enforcement agencies find the location of any cellphone user without obtaining a court order, the New York Times and Motherboard have reported.
The FCC didn't offer the carriers any settlements, one of the people said. That might prompt some carriers to fight the charges against them through the commission's administrative process.
The fines, if paid, could fall heavily on T-Mobile if it closes its planned merger with Sprint in the coming weeks. The two companies recently revised the terms of that agreement, which was worth $26 billion when it was signed two years ago.
Under the revised merger, the parent companies of T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to split the cost of any liabilities up to $200 million. Sprint owner SoftBank Group Corp. would be on the hook for excess liabilities above $200 million.

Texto completo: Barbara Nell Land nÃ©e Neblett
Barbara Nell Land nÃ©e Neblett passed away peacefully on February 22, 2020 at Carle Hospital in Urbana, Illinois at the age of 96.
Barbara was a writer.
After graduating from Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism she won a Pulitzer Travel Scholarship which provided funds for travel and reporting while she wrote many articles on the role of women in the reconstruction of postwar Europe.
The list of places she worked as a journalist would be long, but notably included the Miami Herald, Life Magazine, Armed Forces Network, The New York Times, and Reno Gazette-Journal. She wrote over twenty books, including many co-authored with her husband Myrick Land.
Among her books she was perhaps most proud of The New Explorers about women scientists in Antarctica. She had a life-long fascination with the continent from third grade, when she read in the Weekly Reader about a boy scout who traveled to Antarctica. She complained to her father that boys could do things like that and she couldn't, and her father replied "When you grow up you can do whatever you want."
Years later, when researching the book, she got as close as New Zealand, approved for the official flight to the research station, only to be unable to board because the scientists and their equipment reached the weight limit for the plane.
Although she never made it to Antarctica as a working writer, she did eventually visit as a tourist, taking two cruises there in her 80s.
Barbara was born in Hopkinsville, Kentucky on July 11, 1923 to Robert Neblett and Jacqueline Neblett. She is survived by her son and daughter, Robert Land of Santa Barbara, California, and Jacquelyn Brewer of Savoy, Illinois, and by her granddaughter Kyra Yorkland. She was preceded in death by her husband Myrick Land.
No funeral service is planned. The family will scatter her ashes in Nevada, near where her husband's ashes were scattered. In lieu of flowers, please donate in Barbara's memory to the UNR Foundation, Barbara and Myrick Land Scholarship Endowment (175218), c/o UNR Foundation, Mailstop 0162, Reno, NV 89557. The family would like to thank all the people at Willowbrook of Savoy who took such good care of Barbara the past three years.

Texto completo: (JTA) — Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein was found guilty Feb. 24 on two counts of rape and sexual assault, but was acquitted on more serious charges.
A New York State Supreme Court jury found Weinstein, 67, guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree. He was acquitted of the more serious charge of first-degree rape, and of the most serious charges in the case, two counts of predatory sexual assault.
Weinstein appeared unmoved as the verdict was read in the Manhattan courtroom, The New York Times reported. He had pleaded not guilty and said that any sexual activity was consensual.
His defense team has already launched the appeals process, Deadline reported, citing sources.
He was ordered straight to jail to await sentencing, scheduled for March 11.
Weinstein still faces charges in a separate case in Los Angeles. His indictment in that case was announced on the first day of his Manhattan trial.
Weinstein faces a maximum of 25 years in prison on the charge of sexually assaulting production assistant Miriam Haley at his Soho apartment on July 10, 2006. He was convicted of third-degree rape against Jessica Mann, an aspiring actress who accused him of assaulting her at a DoubleTree Hotel in New York on March 18, 2013.
Six women testified at trial that he had sexually assaulted them, though Weinstein was charged with crimes in connection with only two. The others were allowed to testify to establish a pattern of behavior.
Dozens of women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct that took place over decades, including actresses such as Rosanna Arquette, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Auschwitz Museum again calls out Amazon’s Bezos for selling ‘Nazi propaganda’

Texto completo: (JTA) — For the second time in three days, the Auschwitz Museum has condemned Amazon for selling Nazi-era anti-Semitic children’s books in English and German.
“When you decide to make a profit on selling vicious antisemitic Nazi propaganda published without any critical comment or context, you need to remember that those words led not only to the Holocaust but also many other hate crimes motivated by antisemitism,” the museum said Feb. 23 in a tweet.
The tweet came two days after the museum called out Amazon owner Jeff Bezos in a tweet, saying “Hateful, virulently antisemitic Nazi propaganda is available for sale not only on Amazon UK. Books by authors like Julius Streicher can be found also on Amazon & Amazon DE.” The tweet included a letter from Britain’s Holocaust Educational Trust calling on Amazon to “remove Nazi anti-Semitic books listed on your website.”
Streicher wrote the 1938 children’s book “The Poisonous Mushroom,” referring to Jews and calling them the “devil in human form.”
The book was used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, during which Streicher was convicted of crimes against humanity.
“As a bookseller, we are mindful of book censorship throughout history, and we do not take this lightly,” an Amazon representative said in a statement to The New York Times. “We believe that providing access to written speech is important, including books that some may find objectionable, though we take concerns from the Holocaust Educational Trust seriously and are listening to its feedback.”
Over the past 18 months, Amazon has removed two books by David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, as well as several titles by George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, and books by other Nazi authors, The New York Times reported earlier this month.

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. This column was originally written for Not Shutting Up, a newsletter about the issues facing journalism and democracy. Sign up for it here.
Wednesday was an ominous day for freedom of the press in this country, and I want to tell you why.
You may have heard or seen that President Trump filed a libel suit against the New York Times. Perhaps you weren’t surprised: the president is known to frequently disparage the Times even as he reads it obsessively. Borrowing a page from what I’ve referred to before as a Mount Rushmore of totalitarians, Robespierre, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, Trump loves to call the press the “enemy of the people.”
But Wednesday’s suit is an important step beyond bluster to try to silence the press using the legal system — and just days after the president announced that he considers himself the country’s “chief law enforcement officer.”
This new lawsuit is a joke under our current constitutional law of libel. It complains of an opinion piece written by a former executive editor of the Times, Max Frankel. Frankel, 89, a great journalist (and, admittedly, a friend of mine for more than 40 years), won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 and ran the Times opinion pages from 1977-86 and its news pages from 1986-94. His op-ed last March reflected his belief that Trump and Vladimir Putin of Russia were engaged in a symbiotic relationship, with Putin helping Trump gain power in this country while Trump sought to soften U.S. policy toward Russia.
Both of these elements — Putin’s help to Trump and Trump’s history of going easy on Putin — are established facts, with Trump’s own government reminding us again this month that Putin’s work continues, and numerous reports making clear that Trump has worked to placate Russia, even if others in his administration sometimes stymie this impulse. Whether, as Frankel argued, this suggests an implicit quid pro quo is the sort of opinion that belongs on, well, on the opinion pages, where it ran.
And the Supreme Court has declared that opinion is constitutionally protected. So this case should be readily dismissed. And Trump must know it, because just three years ago he got a libel suit against him dismissed in the very same court in which he sued the Times on Wednesday on the grounds that what he had said about a critic was protected opinion.
But the president sued anyway. He sued even though he had never complained about the story after it was published. He sued almost a year after the article was published, just ahead of the statute of limitations expiring. On Wednesday, in a news briefing where he attempted to minimize the seriousness of the looming pandemic, he said “there will be more coming.”
And that is the point. What is happening here is a cynical play to establish a talking point. Now, whenever the nation’s leading newspaper reveals some new abuse of power or malfeasance in office, Trump can point out he is suing the Times. Perhaps, he may hope, the Times news pages will even pull a punch or two to avoid being seen as a presidential adversary. (I hope, and trust, they will not. I hope Max Frankel’s successors will instruct their staffs that no one is to mention or even think of this silly lawsuit in considering other coverage of Trump.)
This is not Donald Trump’s first libel suit, or the first such suit he has brought frivolously. Trump has been saying for nearly five years now that he wants to “open up the libel laws.” Some of us listened to Trump during the 2016 campaign and saw the threat he posed of reinstituting the law of seditious libel, the crime of challenging the government, long since eradicated from American law. That threat took a new turn on Wednesday. This is an issue, amid all the craziness of the hour, that merits your attention, not least because “there will be more.”

Portraits of Lancaster city black police officers for Black History Month don't fix unjust laws

Texto completo: We asked for justice reform. We got portraits of black cops.
This year for Black History Month, the City of Lancaster is displaying a series of portraits of black and African American police officers to showcase the “person behind the uniform (and) to bring a sense of humanity to these black officers and firefighters.”
I understand what the city was going for. In an era of viral videos of heated moments between cops and citizens — often though not exclusively of color — the city wants to find the people who live in the intersection of law enforcement and black America.
Black police officers bring diversity and a different perspective to the force and, for their service, I’m grateful. But I certainly hope the people in power can be honest with themselves about the effects of their decision to put black cops on a pedestal for Black History Month.
Neither more policing nor more diverse policing will make us safer, and the reason is simple: The circumstances that lead to arrests are not reduced when police departments hire black officers.
Our laws turn bad circumstances into crimes and dole out punishments instead of help. Our friends and neighbors on the wrong side of police interactions would be far better served by art that directly exposes injustice, not art that glorifies the black enforcers of it.
These portraits are powerless to solve justice inequality, and they serve as a smokescreen for people in positions of authority to avoid having real conversations about justice. Under the guise of “celebrating diversity,” the city is engaging in the worst sort of tokenism, on par with universities that feature black students on brochures but refuse to change their admission practices to accommodate black applicants.
I’m brought back to the infamous stun gun incident of June 2018, in which a white police officer here in Lancaster deployed a Taser on an unarmed black man as he sat cross-legged on the curb. The incident was covered nationally by The New York Times. And yet, Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace formally declined to fire the officer, citing that he acted within the guidelines of the use of force policies, some of which had not been updated for about 40 years.
In a Facebook video, Sorace promised to “improve community-police relations” and “seriously reconsider” the use of force policy.
And I wonder: Would we have felt better if a black officer had been the one to use a Taser on an unarmed citizen? Do we prefer to have unjust, outdated laws enforced by black officers rather than white officers? Is Black History Month meant to honor black people complicit in unjust systems, or to praise those who dismantle the systems and work toward justice?
It simply doesn’t matter who we ask to enforce laws that criminalize poverty, mental illness or substance use disorders. It is bad and wrong that Lancaster pays officers to enforce unjust laws. These laws hurt people I love. So when I’m told we’re celebrating “diversity” among the people who enforce cruel, classist laws, I’m reluctant to join in the city’s show of self-congratulations.
Homeless Lancastrians aren’t comforted when the officer apprehending them for taking a nap in Binns Park is black. Being arrested and thrown in jail by a black officer won’t cure a substance use disorder or mental illness any more than being arrested by a white officer will.
The problem isn’t white policing. The problem is the policing of vulnerable communities.
The City of Lancaster, specifically the Public Art Program, would rather praise the black officers who carry out unjust laws than face the systems that criminalize blackness, illness and poverty in the first place.
While I’m thankful for the service of black officers, I feel betrayed that the mayor has used my favorite month as a public relations stunt to pat herself on the back while people I love are dying.
Black excellence is not best embodied by those who spend their careers making life more difficult for my friends and my family. Black excellence is fighting injustice, innovating toward progress, and championing peace. Black excellence is black teachers, black nurses, black disruptors and black parents. Portraits of these folks would force us to confront the uncomfortable reality that unjust laws on Lancaster’s books hurt good people.
Elected officials task black officers with the enforcement of indefensible laws, then celebrate the progress they’ve made during Black History Month. What a shame.

Democrats, here’s how to defeat Donald Trump

Texto completo: If this election turns out to be just between a self-proclaimed socialist and an undiagnosed sociopath, we will be in a terrible, terrible place as a country. How do we prevent that?
My short answer is that the Democrats have to do something extraordinary — forge a national unity ticket the likes of which they have never forged before. And that’s true even if Democrats nominate someone other than Bernie Sanders.
What would this super ticket look like? Well, I suggest Sanders — and Michael Bloomberg, who seems his most viable long-term challenger — lay it out this way:
“I want people to know that if I am the Democratic nominee these will be my Cabinet choices — my team of rivals. I want Amy Klobuchar as my vice president. Her decency, experience and moderation will be greatly appreciated across America.
“I want Mike Bloomberg (or Bernie Sanders) as my secretary of the Treasury. Our plans for addressing income inequality are actually not that far apart. I want Joe Biden as my secretary of state. No one in our party knows the world better.
“I will ask Elizabeth Warren to serve as health and human services secretary. No one could bring more energy and intellect to the task of expanding health care for more Americans than Senator Warren.
“I want Kamala Harris for attorney general. She has the toughness and integrity needed to clean up the corrupt mess Donald Trump has created in our Justice Department.
“I would like Mayor Pete as homeland security secretary; his intelligence and military background would make him a quick study in that job. I would like Tom Steyer to head a new Cabinet position: secretary of national infrastructure. We’re going to rebuild America. And I am asking Cory Booker, the former mayor of Newark, to become secretary of housing and urban development.
“I am asking Mitt Romney to be my commerce secretary. It is vital that the public understands that my government will be representing all Americans, including Republicans. I would like Andrew Yang to be energy secretary, overseeing our nuclear stockpile and renewable energy innovation.
“I am asking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to serve as our U.N. ambassador. Can you imagine how our international standing would improve with youth worldwide with her representing next-gen America?
“And I want Sen. Michael Bennet, the former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, to be my secretary of education. No one understands education reform better than he does.
“Finally, I am asking William H. McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who oversaw the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden, to be my defense secretary. Admiral McRaven, more than any other retired military officer, has had the courage to speak out against the way President Trump has politicized our intelligence agencies.”
If Bernie or Bloomberg or whoever emerges to head the Democratic ticket brings together such a team of rivals, I am confident it will defeat Trump in a landslide. But if progressives think they can win without the moderates — or the moderates without the progressives — they are crazy.
If they don’t join together — if the Democrats opt for a circular firing squad — you can kiss the America you grew up in goodbye.

Buttigieg, ill, cancels fundraisers in county

Texto completo: Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg canceled plans for two fundraisers scheduled for this evening at private residences in Palm Beach and Wellington.
The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, also canceled two appearances scheduled for earlier today in Miami, citing an unspecified illness.
“We heard he was [debating] last night with a fever and possibly coming down with the flu,” said attorney Bill Bone, who was scheduled to host the Palm Beach fundraiser at his home on the island. “He called my co-host personally today and was very apologetic and very sorry.”
Wellington supporters were also left disappointed.
“I was looking forward to having a presidential candidate come visit Wellington,” said Vice Mayor Michael Napoleone. “I hope he’s able to reschedule. I think he’s intriguing, he’s young, he has an interesting message, and I think people want to hear different perspectives.
The cancellation announcement was disseminated shortly after Buttigieg took the stage last night in South Carolina for the final Democratic debate before the South Carolina primary on Saturday and Super Tuesday on March 3.
While Buttigieg did not appear outwardly sick, he tallied up the second-lowest amount of speaking time. Only billionaire Tom Steyer racked up fewer minutes, according to The New York Times.
But when Buttigieg did speak, he targeted front-runner Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sanders’ supporters, referring to recent intelligence reports that show Russians interfering once again with America’s democratic election process.
“They want chaos and chaos is what is coming our way,” Buttigieg said of Russia. “I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country. “
Looking straight into the camera, he also added this warning: “If you're watching right now and you're a billionaire, I will raise your taxes.”
Buttigieg’s campaign did not immediately say if he would be rescheduling his visit to South Florida, but Bones said he was given a tentative date of March 11.
“In the meantime, if you know anyone who needs 200 pigs in a blanket, I’m happy to send them their way,” Bones said.

Socialism makes a comeback with Sanders

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Members of the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” U.S. Olympic hockey team have come under fire for joining President Trump at his Las Vegas rally last week wearing “Keep America Great” hats. In fact, their appearance was highly appropriate.
Forty years ago, those players’ victory over the Soviets helped restore our nation’s faith in American greatness. A more troubling development in Nevada occurred the day after the rally, when Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — a socialist who embraced Soviet-backed regimes — won the state’s Democratic caucuses, making him the undisputed front-runner for the party’s presidential nomination. Only in a country where many have forgotten the lessons of the Miracle on Ice would this be possible.
The Miracle on Ice came at a time when many believed the Soviet Union was ascendant and that the United States was on the decline. President Jimmy Carter bemoaned a “crisis of confidence . . . a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will.” Then, on Feb. 22, 1980, a bunch of American amateurs — most of them college kids — defeated the mighty Soviet team in Lake Placid, New York, and millions of Americans thought: If we can beat the them on the ice, we can beat them in the Cold War.
Four days after the Miracle on Ice, Ronald Reagan won the Republican primary in New Hampshire and soon promised to “make America great again.” As president, he boldly pledged that we would leave Soviet communism on the “ash heap of history” and, within the decade, the Berlin Wall was pulled down. The first blow was delivered not by a pickax, but by a hockey stick.
Four decades later, a new generation of Americans has grown up with no living memory of the Cold War, and apparently no understanding of what socialism wrought for the 100 million people killed by communist regimes and the billions of others who were either imprisoned or consigned to lives of abject poverty and totalitarian oppression.
How else to explain the rise of Sanders, who stood with those regimes and held them up as examples for the United States and the world?
In 1985, Sanders traveled to Nicaragua to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet-backed Sandinista revolution. He called the country’s brutal dictator, Daniel Ortega, an “impressive guy,” and defended Ortega’s human-rights crackdown and suspension of civil liberties.
In 1986, Sanders declared “I was very excited and impressed by the Cuban revolution.” Three years later, he visited Castro’s tropical gulag where he praised the Cuban dictator for delivering “free health care, free education, free housing” and said that “under Castro, enormous progress has been made in improving the lives of poor people.” When he returned home he said of his visit “I did not see a hungry child. I did not see any homeless people. . . . The revolution there is far deeper and more profound than I understood it to be. It really is a revolution in terms of values.”
In 1988, Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union and gave a speech there praising Soviet health care and housing policies, and blasting U.S. intervention against Nicaragua and other Soviet satellite — causing members of his delegation to walk out in protest.
There was a term for people like Sanders back in the Cold War days: fellow traveler. Sanders claims he is not a communist, but a democratic socialist. You know who else might have made that claim? The German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea). If you see the modifier “Democratic” in a country’s name, it’s a dead giveaway that it is a socialist dictatorship.
Sanders was wrong during the Cold War, and he is still wrong today. On Sunday, Sanders defended Castro in an interview with CBS News’s “60 Minutes,” saying, “When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing?” Regarding Venezuela, a brutal Cuba-backed socialist narco-dictatorship, Sanders has opposed the recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate interim president. Asked by the New York Times, “Is it appropriate for the United States to provide nonmilitary support for regime-change efforts, as the Trump administration did in Venezuela?” (emphasis added), Sanders replied “No.” And while Sanders now rails against Russia for its 2016 election interference, during the Obama administration he voted against the Magnitsky Act imposing sanctions against Russia for its human-rights abuses.
The idea that a man who embraced communist tyrants could soon be elected president of the United States is stunning — and would have been unthinkable 40 years ago during the Winter Games in Lake Placid. So, spare us the outrage if some of the heroes of those 1980 Olympics want to “Keep America Great.”

Texto completo: On Feb. 21, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that, after two decades of war, nearly 2,500 American deaths, and a trillion-dollar investment, the United States and the Taliban had reached an “understanding” for a one-week pause in violence, to be followed by a broader agreement. Much of the agreement, supposedly taken in “consultation with [Afghanistan’s] Government of National Unity,” remains shrouded in secrecy and secret annexes, but the broad outline is known: America and the Taliban will sign the deal, which will be followed by a U.S. withdrawal and intra-Afghan negotiations in order to bring about a political solution. To borrow an expression I heard in Afghanistan, Pompeo has taken a cucumber, painted it yellow, and now sells a banana. Simply put, President Trump and Pompeo may want out of Afghanistan, but there are problems with the past, present, and future of their deal.
The past is precedent
There is simply nothing new in the agreement. Today, the test of Taliban sincerity is a one-week reduction in violence. During the Clinton administration, it was the willingness of the Taliban to allow U.S. aid programs to help girls' schools or fund crop substitution, as if the willingness of a group dedicated to the West’s demise would have any scruples about cheating its taxpayers. Then, as now, diplomats grasped at assurances that the Taliban would abandon terror. In 1997, Zalmay Khalilzad, who is today the special envoy but at the time was a businessman seeking a cut of a Taliban oil pipeline deal, brought Taliban leaders to the U.S. to meet with oil executives and diplomats. In a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth, the Taliban’s acting minister of Islam and culture, Amir Khan Muttaqi, lied outright, assuring the diplomat that they would not “allow terrorists to use Afghanistan as a base for terrorism.” Muttaqi lied, and today, he remains an unrepentant member of the Taliban’s leadership team.
Pompeo may accept the same Taliban assurance that they will abandon terrorism, but nowhere does he nor do they define “terror.” This is a broad problem in international affairs, and it is why Turkey says it counters terrorism while supporting the Islamic State, or why Iranian leaders say they oppose terrorism while bankrolling Hamas and Hezbollah. Perhaps the agreement defines terrorism in a secret annex, but why would this be necessary unless that definition falls short? Alas, it seems that Pompeo is guilty of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s conceit: He has become so invested in the art of the deal that he is blind to the loopholes through which Taliban brigades might charge.
Money also matters. The late communist leader Najibullah held on to power in Kabul for three years after Soviet forces withdrew. The reason was not his popularity, but rather, he benefited from a Moscow-directed peace dividend that channeled savings and hardware from the Soviet withdrawal from East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to Afghanistan. When that money ran out, however, Najibullah lost his ability to dispense patronage and retired to the U.N. compound where he remained until the Taliban seized and murdered him four years later. Current President Ashraf Ghani might not even have that longevity, given international donor fatigue and Trump’s belief that the $30 billion annual price of investment in Afghanistan is no longer worth it.
The problematic present
Pompeo insists that this deal is the product of careful consultations with all parties. That is false. Khalilzad met repeatedly with Taliban representatives in Qatar, but he actively avoided meaningful consultations with the democratically elected Afghan government. This deliberate slighting ultimately led to a diplomatic blowup a year ago when Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan president’s top security aide, complained that Khalilzad was acting more as a viceroy than as a negotiator. Pompeo and Khalilzad responded with fury, blacklisting Mohib, denying him visas to the U.S. and instructing American officials to boycott any meeting that he attended. They also imposed a de facto visa ban on Taliban critic Amrullah Saleh, the former intelligence chief and interior minister (and now newly elected vice president). Consider that Pompeo today brags about meaningful consultation with Afghanistan’s government yet treated the elected government’s interlocutors worse than Taliban terrorists freed from Guantanamo Bay or the North Korean leadership. Khalilzad, who did business with the Taliban, engaged with the Iranians, and is neck-deep in the knuckle-fighting of Iraqi Kurdistan’s oil industry, is no snowflake. Pompeo did not blacklist Mohib and Saleh to salve Khalilzad’s feelings, but rather to avoid any critical assessment of their deal. Again, there is Clinton-era precedent for this. As negotiations for the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea neared their conclusion, South Korean President Kim Young Sam lashed out about the “half-baked” agreement in a New York Times interview. Clinton was furious and threatened to blackball Sam. Clinton got his way on the deal, and North Korea eventually got nuclear weapons.
Inter-Afghan dialogue is long overdue. If the Taliban want to talk, they should talk to Afghanistan’s elected government. And if they believe they have the Afghan people’s support, they should run in Afghanistan’s elections. Alas, just as the Taliban agree to such a dialogue, Khalilzad's and Pompeo’s machinations may have undercut it. Afghanistan held its elections on Sept. 28, 2019, but, amid widespread allegations of fraud, the Independent Election Commission declared incumbent Ghani the victor only on Feb. 18, 2020. According to the official results, Ghani won 50.6% of the vote, enabling him to bypass a runoff. Afghan officials privately say they came under tremendous pressure, first to put off the September vote altogether, and then, to quiet complaints about irregularities in order to avoid a second round. Whereas the State Department once encouraged international observation to bolster legitimacy, in the last year, it discouraged it. Trump interlocutors such as Fox News commentator and retired Gen. Jack Keane told challenger (and Afghan Chief Executive) Abdullah Abdullah to “stand down” for the sake of unity ahead of Taliban talks. The U.S. should not be in the business of subverting democratic elections, however — nor should it ever believe that a government whose electoral legitimacy remains cloudy can enter talks with a strong hand.
Of course, this is not the first time Afghanistan has had national dialogue. Afghans were engaged in dialogue a decade ago. But, on Sept. 20, 2011, Taliban suicide bombers assassinated former Afghanistan President Burhanuddin Rabbani at his home alongside four other members of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council. That murder should not have surprised; the Taliban have always approached national dialogue as an asymmetric warfare strategy to distract and delay opponents until a final military push. The Taliban’s 1996 seizure of Kabul, too, came against the backdrop of national dialogue.
A future of failure
Stopping “endless wars” may make for a popular slogan, but it is no strategy. Renewed civil war in Afghanistan is a given, as the Taliban seek to achieve at the point of a gun what they can never achieve at the ballot box. But, for Trump and other neo-isolationists, such events are not the responsibility of the U.S. to prevent.
Three problems loom large, however. The first is Taliban and al Qaeda intertwinement. Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani’s Feb. 20 New York Times op-ed ignored the Taliban’s al Qaeda problem. Both the United Nations and the U.S. designate Haqqani as a terrorist because of his al Qaeda partnership, and al Qaeda eulogized Haqqani’s father, Jalaluddin, upon his 2016 death. U.N. reports suggest the Taliban-al Qaeda relationship is ongoing.
The second is the Islamic State. While the Afghan government may not survive a civil war, it is also unlikely that the Taliban will triumph. They failed in 2001. Those who lived under Taliban brutality do not seek to return to it, and the younger generation of Afghans find music, Bollywood, and video games more compelling than Taliban austerity. If no side triumphs, then a dangerous vacuum emerges into which ISIS is ready to step. The group has staged a number of bloody attacks and bombings over the past year. The 2020 withdrawal from Afghanistan could easily become Trump’s version of Barack Obama’s 2011 departure from Iraq — that is, a decision reversed by the exigency to fight ISIS.
The third problem is Pakistan. While Americans remain frustrated that Pakistan has provided safe haven for Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents, throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the insurgency went the other way, with Pashtun nationalists from Afghanistan striking into Pakistan. That age might return. One senior Afghan official told me bluntly that Americans never understood counterterrorism and that the real fight would begin once American forces got out of the way. “If a bomb goes off in Kabul,” he suggested, “then one should go off in Lahore. And if an attack occurs in Jalalabad, then there should be two such attacks in Rawalpindi.” Such attacks can destabilize Pakistan and embolden reactionaries, never a sanguine occurrence in a nuclear power.
Wishful thinking about diplomacy has now become a bipartisan disease. Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini once declared that he was “not interested in personal power,” a notion the New York Times affirmed when Richard Falk, then a Princeton University professor, declared, “The depiction of him as fanatical, reactionary, and the bearer of crude prejudices seems certainly and happily false.” How sad it is, 40 years later, that Trump and Pompeo are approaching the Taliban with the same sophistry, especially when the consequences of the self-delusion could be as consequential.

Joe Biden’s own campaign debunks claims about getting arrested for Nelson Mandela

Texto completo: If Joe Biden isn't lying, he's probably misremembering.

In the case of the former vice president’s recent claim that he was arrested in South Africa in the late 1970s for attempting to meet with then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela, Biden almost certainly lied, according to his own staff.

Biden “was separated from the [Congressional Black Caucus] members he was traveling with at the airport,” campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told reporters on Feb. 25. “Biden was separated from a congressional delegation in South Africa and was referring to that.”

“When he landed, he was not allowed to go through the same door as the rest of the party he was with,” she said. “Obviously, this was apartheid South Africa. There was a white door. There was a black door. He did not want to go through the white door and have the rest of the party go to the black door. He was separated."
Her explanation is a long, long way off from the version of events Biden told supporters earlier this month in both Nevada and South Carolina.

“This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid,” Biden said during a Feb. 11 campaign event in Columbia, South Carolina. “I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robben Island.”

Later, on Feb. 16, Biden told a crowd in Las Vegas, Nevada, “After [Mandela] got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office. He threw his arms around me and said, ‘I want to say thank you.’ I said, ‘What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?’ He said: ‘You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.’”

His anecdote immediately raised red flags for four reasons.

First, for all his years in public life, no one could recall Biden ever talking about being arrested in South Africa, which, according to the former vice president himself, happened at around the time he proposed to his wife in 1977.

Second, after Biden told the Mandela story on three separate occasions on the 2020 campaign trail, no one could find evidence of the alleged incident, which is astonishing considering Biden was sworn in as a senator in 1973, four years prior to his supposed arrest in South Africa. It should not be difficult to find evidence of a member of the U.S. Congress being forcibly detained in a foreign country during an overseas trip in the late 1970s.

Third, Soweto is roughly 900 miles away from Robben Island.

Lastly, Biden’s campaign refused to respond to multiple requests for comment regarding his anecdote, including five separate requests from the New York Times. In fact, it took Biden’s spokeswoman a full two weeks after he first claimed he had been arrested in South Africa to address the matter.
As to the campaign’s explanation about Biden getting separated at an airport in South Africa, it is important to note that congressional delegations at that time would not have landed in the country of apartheid. They would have landed in Lesotho, which has been its own independent kingdom since 1966.

This is the part where Biden’s supporters argue now that he merely misremembered what happened. Well, good luck convincing people that the former vice president simply “misremembered” being “arrested” in South Africa at an airport at which he didn't land and then “misremembered” being thanked personally by Nelson Mandela for his bravery.

At this point, it may be safe to just use the word "lie" to describe Biden's tale of courage under South African fire.

After failing to disclose her husband's work for the Warren campaign, NYT columnist pens 'The Case for Elizabeth Warren'

Texto completo: The New York Times has launched a new feature this week in which its opinion columnists make the case for each of the top 2020 Democratic candidates.

The New York Times’s Frank Bruni argued on behalf of former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The New York Times’s David Brooks argued on behalf of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Naturally, the New York Times’s Michelle Goldberg argued for Sen. Elizabeth Warren. I say "naturally" because Goldberg spent much of 2019 promoting the senator’s candidacy without disclosing the fact that her husband’s firm consults for the Warren campaign.

Goldberg has written extensively in the last year on the 2020 Democratic primary, including six articles that include explicit praise for Warren and eight articles that attack the senator’s 2020 opponents. The most interesting thing about these 14 articles is that the author never mentions the fact that her husband, Matthew Ipcar, is the executive creative director at a digital strategy firm that received its first check from Warren for President on Jan. 8, 2019, a month before the campaign formally launched.

To Goldberg’s credit, she discloses in her new article, "The Case for Elizabeth Warren," that her husband is tied to the senator’s presidential bid. But she has not always been so transparent.

In April 2019, for example, more than two months after the Warren campaign launched, Goldberg praised the 2020 candidate for taking “the lead among Democratic presidential candidates in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin [against President Trump],” adding that the senator’s opponents “should follow her.”

The article has no note alerting readers to the relationship between the senator’s White House run and Ipcar’s firm.

In June of the same year, she declared Warren “one of the … clear winners” of the first Democratic debate.

Again, no disclosure.

She wrote in August that the senator was “widely viewed as shining in both the June and July Democratic debates”; she praised the 2020 candidate for criticizing members of her own party for their supposed hesitance to impeach Trump; she even wrote an article defending a Warren campaign aide.

On the trail in Iowa, in August 2019, Goldberg wrote Warren is “sincere and unscripted” and has “the comforting aspect" of a "benevolent" parent.

At the same time that she has built up Warren as a model legislator and exceptional presidential candidate, the New York Times columnist has been attacking the senator’s 2020 Democratic primary opponents.

Goldberg referred unflatteringly to Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as a “chameleonlike” onetime “darling” of the crowd that supports Sen. Bernie Sanders. She has written entire articles calling on 2020 hopefuls to drop out, including one titled “Howard Schultz, Please Don’t Run for President” and one titled “The Wrong Time for Joe Biden.”

Goldberg claimed it would be “a bad idea” for Democrats to nominate Biden, adding in yet another article, “I don’t want Biden to be the nominee for ideological reasons.” She wrote an article quoting a potential Democratic primary voter who said she was “livid” about Biden’s “repeated gaffes.”

She even wrote in June 2019 that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio “shouldn’t run for president."

On Jan. 27, Goldberg cautioned readers about Sanders and his “legions of trolls” who antagonize Democrats who “stand in their way.” The article itself is just one giant shrug over the question of whether Sanders can defeat Trump. She concludes ultimately that she has no idea, but not before telling readers the “Sanders juggernaut still scares me” and that she is “terrified” his polling will not hold up against Republican attack ads.

None of these articles mention the apparently relevant fact that her husband’s firm consults for the Warren campaign. They do not mention that the firm was founded by the Massachusetts senator’s chief strategist, Joe Rospars. They certainly do not mention that the firm has already collected more than $1 million from Warren for President, according to Federal Election Commission records.

Warren announced her candidacy in February 2019. Between then and Feb. 26, Goldberg noted in only two 2020- and Warren-related articles that her husband is tied to the campaign, stating directly that he “is consulting for” the senator. Those two lonely mentions of consulting came on Jan. 13 and Feb. 7 of this year after nearly an entire year of Goldberg's very active, disclosure-free advocacy for her husband's client. On Feb. 27, she disclosed once again.

The New York Times has yet to provide a reasonable explanation for why one of its employees was able to write so many articles in favor of Warren without disclosing the fact that her husband is connected to the senator’s campaign. The New York Times has offered no explanation for this, even after the matter was raised by the Washington Examiner as well as other news publications.

Goldberg is entitled to her opinion. That is what the most powerful and influential news organization in America pays her for. But her husband works for Warren. He even did some consulting work for the Massachusetts lawmaker prior to her launching her candidacy, as the New York Times columnist herself mentioned twice in January 2019. Any sentence Goldberg writes that can be seen as promoting Warren or attacking the senator’s 2020 competitors should be followed by a note disclosing her husband’s financial stake in the Massachusetts lawmaker’s candidacy. This is standard news media ethics.

On Thursday, Goldberg and the New York Times got it right. But why did it take so long?

Q&amp;A with Ross Douthat

Texto completo: On Feb. 25, the New York Times columnist Ross Douthat published The Decadent Society: How We Became the Victims of Our Own Success. (A review ran in the Feb. 25 issue of the Washington Examiner magazine.) This week, Douthat spoke with Life & Arts Editor Park MacDougald about decadence, Israel, and Mad Max.
What do you mean when you say that modern society is decadent?
I mean stagnation, drift, and repetition at a really high level of wealth, power, and civilizational development — a society that has done really well for itself but has run out of things to do and ends up going in circles.
You start the book by tying the beginning of our decadence to the end of our ambitions for space exploration. Why is this such an important turning point?
Well, first, it’s just a convenient coincidence. The moon landing happened in 1969, and economic stagnation, declining birth rates, and technological stagnation all started sometime between 1965 and 1975. But I don’t actually think this is a coincidence. There is something in American society about the idea of the frontier that is an incredibly strong motivator for action, creativity, and dynamism. And sometime between the moon landing and the Challenger explosion in 1986, we either realized or decided that what we thought was the new frontier was too cold and far away and empty to explore. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that that realization happened at the same time we started stagnating on a lot of other fronts.
You identify four horsemen of decadence. The first is economic stagnation. Many on the Right think that the economy is booming — why do you disagree?
Stagnation doesn’t mean that growth ceases. It’s more about deceleration from the sort of growth we achieved in the fairly recent past and the fact that our growth today is more dependent on huge amounts of deficit spending. The Trump boom is a good thing, but the fact that you have to pay yourself large sums of borrowed money in order to sustain 2% growth, when 50 years ago you could have 4% or 5% growth without deficits, suggests that something substantial has changed in the economy.
The second horseman is sterility, by which you mean low birthrates. But if people are just choosing not to have kids, what’s the problem? Can’t we just bring in more immigrants to keep the economy afloat?
Well, you can’t always bring in more immigrants. That solution brings with it all kinds of political and cultural upheavals. And outside of sub-Saharan Africa, there aren’t actually going to be that many young workers eager to fill jobs in Europe and America.
Now, you can make a case that people are making these choices and that if the implication of those choices is that society ages and growth slows down, well, that’s just the price you pay. But there’s a big gap between how many kids men and women say they want and how many they actually have.
There are exceptions to this rule — namely Israel, where even secular people have birthrates way above replacement level. But this just suggests to me that there’s some sort of loss of faith or loss of belief in the future that’s driving sterility in the West. There’s something in humanity where you want to believe you’re part of a larger story. That desire is answered most fully by religion, but it can also be answered by forms of national solidarity that convince people that their works will live on after them. That’s something still palpably there in Israel, because it’s the ark of the Jewish people. It’s hard to find other places in the West where people have similar levels of confidence that the story they're a part of is something real and worthy of sacrifice.
The third horseman is sclerosis or the stagnation and gridlock of Western politics. You identify Japan’s Shinzo Abe as perhaps the most successful leader at resisting political decadence? Why?
I’m no expert on Japanese politics, but for a long time, Japan looked like the most sclerotic and decadent of the major Western countries. They had a new prime minister basically every nine months over a period of eight to 14 years. And what Abe has been able to do is what many Western populists want to do, which is to combine a mix of cultural traditionalism and nationalism with various programs that are pro-growth, pro-dynamism, and pro-family. I don’t think Japan has escaped decadence, but I think Abe has kept up the battle longer than any other leader and has done so without behaving like a fool or a strongman.
The final horseman is repetition, which is your name for cultural decadence. It’s most clearly true when applied to movies, but some might argue that this is the area where we’re least decadent — aren’t there all these interesting and weird cultural movements happening on the internet?
Well, the cultural landscape of a country with 300 million people is so broad that it’s easier to make generalizations about Star Wars movies than to parse what exactly is happening in literary culture. Even so, it’s not that it’s impossible to write an interesting novel today, it’s more that even when there is creativity, it’s hard for it to find much purchase in the wider culture. And while there are interesting things on the internet, there’s a question of how much they are real and how much they are playacting in a virtual safe space.
When you look at older diagnoses of decadence, there’s often an idea that it’s essentially unsustainable. The Arab historian Ibn Khaldun had this idea of dynastic cycles — essentially, barbarians come in from the desert, establish themselves as a ruling class, and then slowly grow so weak and effeminate that they’re unable to hold on to power. You seem to think our decadence is pretty sustainable.
Our era is unique in that we’re closer than we’ve ever been to being a world civilization, so it’s harder to find zones of chaos outside our borders that would produce whatever the 21st-century equivalent of the Mongol hordes would be. Which means change has to come from within — maybe one generation’s elite has trouble handing over power to the next generation. You can see versions of that today, such as the rise of woke progressivism as an alternative to the hyperachievement-oriented meritocracy that dominated my own youth. But you also have plenty of historical examples of civilizations, such as the Roman or the Ottoman empires, that were able to stay decadent for a long time. And I think, in particular, virtual reality is a new thing in human history, where the sorts of people who in the past would’ve been participating in cycles of decay and renewal are instead playing video games and reenacting Protestant Reformation-era debates on Twitter. And I don’t mean that as a condemnation — I literally do that as part of my job.
Could you recommend a piece of nondecadent art for our audience?
I’m not going to elaborate on this at all, but I think the least decadent movie of the last decade was Mad Max: Fury Road.

Democratic officials may have pushed bogus intelligence alleging the Russians want to reelect Trump

Texto completo: The New York Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence officials warned members of Congress that Russia is interfering in the 2020 U.S. election to “try to get President Trump reelected.”

The report, based entirely on anonymous sources, also claimed that Trump “berated” former acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire for briefing members of the House on the Kremlin’s reported interference efforts. NBC News, also citing anonymous sources, reported the same, seemingly confirming the narrative that Maguire lost his job because he informed lawmakers that Russia is working to reelect Trump.

However, CNN’s Jake Tapper reported at the same time that other anonymous officials dispute the way the “story is being told.”

As if these conflicting accounts were not bad enough already, NBC reports now that yet more anonymous intelligence officials say they are upset that their findings on Russia were badly distorted by whoever leaked the alleged details of the closed-door briefings.
Guess who it was?

“Intelligence officials say that was an overstatement, fueled, they believe, by a misinterpretation by some Democratic lawmakers on the committee.”
What a surprise.
“Two intelligence officials told NBC News this week that [Shelby Pierson, who led the briefing] did not tell lawmakers that intelligence showed Russia was actively working to help the president's reelection campaign,” the report adds.

So that New York Times “bombshell” report, which Democrats latched on to immediately to accuse Trump of being a “puppet” of Russia, traces back to Democrats who overstated or misunderstood what they were told in an intelligence briefing?

How many news cycles based on dubious or misleading "insider" information from anonymous sources are we going to go through before journalists start applying some rigor? People complain that the Trump era is tiring, but what's really tiring are these five-alarm news cycles based entirely on anonymous sources. Too many of these stories end up imploding, leaving readers even more distrustful of the news media than they were to begin with.

CNN fell for a hot “tip” from an anonymous source in 2017 when it claimed incorrectly that former Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci, who played a significant role on the president's White House transition team, had ties to a $10 billion Russian investment fund owned by a Kremlin-connected bank. Three CNN staffers ended up resigning over the since-retracted story.

Later, CBS News, CNN, and MSNBC reported independently of each other that an email proved Trump and his campaign team coordinated with Russia-aligned hackers during the 2016 presidential election. The reports, which were based on anonymous sources, were all wrong. All of them screwed up the date of the email.

BuzzFeed reported incorrectly in 2019 that Trump directed his attorney, Michael Cohen, “to lie to Congress about the Moscow Tower project.” Like everything else mentioned in this article, the BuzzFeed story, which was based on anonymous sources, turned out to be wrong. Special counsel Robert Mueller himself put out a rare public statement disputing the supposed “scoop” that earned BuzzFeed so much coverage and plaudits from competing newsrooms.

Are we really going to do this right up until Trump’s final day in office?

Texto completo: As it turns out, of all the things needing "disruption" by some startup, cooking dinner wasn't one.
Blue Apron, the premier meal kit service for halfway ambitious millennials, has begun to flounder, laying off 240 workers and shutting down its warehouse in Arlington, Texas. Once heralded by the New York Times as "the Starbucks of the meal kit business," the eight-year-old company has finally run out of steam.
Here's the problem. If you sign up for Blue Apron, you can have two to three recipes delivered to your home each week, complete with all of the ingredients you'll need to cook each two-person meal. To its most ambitious customers, Blue Apron offers four-person meals for as much as $119.84 a week. For some, that price point isn't sustainable. For others, neither is that lifestyle.
People who are too lazy to grocery shop can order groceries through AmazonFresh. Those who are too lazy to cook can go to Chipotle. This particular mood — in which an adult doesn't mind overspending on groceries, does mind going to the grocery store, but doesn't mind cooking as long as the process is as painless as possible — just might not have much of a market.
Two years ago, an article in Forbes questioned whether Blue Apron was "the coal mine for the online meal kit category," meaning that its inevitable demise might spell doom for competitors such as HelloFresh. The question for meal planning services is whether Blue Apron, like MoviePass, suffered not from a lack of demand but the unsustainable nature of the company's business model.
"The overall market is still growing, but not as much as we thought," HelloFresh CEO Dominik Richter explained to the Wall Street Journal, which reported "tepid" growth in the demand for meal kits. In the past 30 days, fewer than 5% of consumers in the United States used meal kits, according to a recent survey.
A few years back, proponents of meal kits were more optimistic. "We don't know why Blue Apron wouldn't have a place in every home in America in some way," Matt Salzberg, then the CEO of Blue Apron, said in 2016.
Now, Blue Apron has almost bottomed out, retaining just two distribution and assembly locations for its 351,000 remaining customers. It has lost millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of customers.
There's a simple explanation: Millennials just aren't that into it. And those who don't want to pay for Blue Apron try to game the system by signing up for a first free meal and never registering for a subscription. It seems like the product is simultaneously too much and too little effort.
Instead, business consultant Brittain Ladd told MarketWatch that consumers are scrapping meal kit services in favor of healthy, ready-to-eat dinners, which provide a similar sense of health consciousness without the cooking.

Don't trust William Barr to reform unconstitutional FISA surveillance

Texto completo: Attorney General William Barr wants the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to be renewed pronto — with no questions asked. If any reforms are needed, he promises to take care of them himself: Don’t worry yourself, America.
Is Barr kidding?
First, a short history lesson. Due to the officials within the government, including Presidents Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, and no doubt many before them, using federal resources to spy on citizens and political opponents, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978. The law set up rules and a court designed to protect our Fourth Amendment privacy rights.
The goal was noble: FISA and its court would give the green light on going after terrorists while, ostensibly, protecting U.S. citizens from unconstitutional intrusions. Then, in the wake of 9/11, Congress passed the USA Patriot Act, which lowered FISA standards. This, too, was supposedly for the sole purpose of targeting terrorists.
But by 2003, according to the New York Times, “The Bush administration, which calls the USA Patriot Act perhaps its most essential tool in fighting terrorists, has begun using the law with increasing frequency in many criminal investigations that have little or no connection to terrorism.”
The newspaper reported, “The government is using its expanded authority under the far-reaching law to investigate suspected drug traffickers, white-collar criminals, blackmailers, child pornographers, money launderers, spies and even corrupt foreign leaders.”
Obviously, what was originally promised concerning the scope of the Patriot Act has changed significantly. This point was driven home in the 2006 movie The Departed, in which Boston police officers and the FBI are surveilling gangsters, and the police captain exclaims, “The Patriot Act! I love it! I love it! I love it!”
Far from just focusing on terrorists, the Patriot Act has become an extraconstitutional law enforcement tool. It has overwhelmingly been used to catch drug dealers more than terrorists. The Washington Post reported in 2011 that after a decade, the Patriot Act “ha[d] been used in 1,618 drug cases and only 15 terrorism cases.”
In 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed to the world that the U.S. government was spying on everyone in every way imaginable. Former President Barack Obama attacked Snowden and insisted that government agents were "not abusing [their] authorities to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails."
In fact, the government was doing all of these things. By 2019, many wondered if the U.S. government had spied on President Trump’s campaign — exactly the kind of Watergate-style corruption that inspired FISA in the first place.
Obviously, FISA is badly in need of reform.
With FISA’s expiration looming in mid-March, Barr held a lunch briefing on Tuesday that most Republicans came out of agreeing to pass a clean extension, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell leading the pack. Barr assured them that any changes that needed to be made to prevent Trump or citizens from being spied on illegally again are actions he would take internally.
Yeah, right. It should be noted here that Barr believes the Patriot Act doesn’t go far enough.
When libertarian-leaning Republican Sens. Rand Paul and Mike Lee voiced their objections to what essentially amounts to a reformless FISA extension, Barr reportedly told them criticizing U.S. government surveillance was dangerous. Why? Because it supposedly helps terrorists. This debate is just about terrorism. Nothing else.
Sound familiar?
In a series of tweets, Lee laid out what reforms he believed needed to be made before FISA should be renewed and added in a later tweet:
Tweet
It’s a safe bet that most Americans would agree. Sadly, the attorney general could care less about FISA reform. After all, Barr is asking citizens to entrust him with protecting the same constitutional rights he has abused for decades.

Democrats face their own reckoning with Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: Let's take a short break from the endless predictions from Democrats and the national media about the "reckoning" Republicans will eventually face over President Trump.
Let's instead talk about the reckoning Democrats are headed for by nominating Sen. Bernie Sanders for president.
The New York Times on Thursday reported that longtime Democrats, including dozens of the party's superdelegates, are on their hands and knees praying that Sanders fails to make it to the convention with a majority of delegates so that they can deny him the nomination.
"If he doesn’t have a majority," the report quotes Jay Jacobs, who is a superdelegate, "it stands to reason that he may not become the nominee.”
The New York Times said that of the 93 superdelegates that the paper interviewed, not even 10 said that they believed Sanders should be the nominee if he gets to the convention with a plurality of delegates but not a majority.
Of course, there are 771 superdelegates in all, so maybe the New York Times just happened to interview the ones who mostly hate the idea of Sanders rebranding their party as the Social Justice Party of America when he becomes the nominee.
But nah, I don't think so.
"Dozens of interviews with Democratic establishment leaders this week show that they are not just worried about Mr. Sanders’s candidacy," the paper said, "but are also willing to risk intraparty damage to stop his nomination at the national convention in July if they get the chance."
"Intraparty damage?" More like "self-immolation."
Old-guard Democrats are beside themselves right now about the sophomoric behavior of Sanders's supporters online. Imagine what they'll do offline when their candidate has the nomination snatched from him by unelected party leaders.
Superdelegates, of course, have every right to vote how they want if no candidate arrives at the convention with a majority of regular delegates. That's the way the Democratic Party set up its nominating process.
But what's the cost of denying Sanders the nomination when he shows up with the most delegates and instead hands it to Joe Biden? Does the left wing of the party (which is most of the party) break off? Does it run through the exact same scenario in 2024, but with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? (She will turn 35 less than a month before that year's election.)
What's the point of panicking? Let it go, Democrats. This is your reckoning.

Texto completo: The debate over illegal immigration is complicated, but it should be a simple bipartisan point of agreement that both sides at least have the First Amendment right to make their arguments, unrestricted. Yet, current federal law criminalizes some pro-immigration speech and unfairly stifles debate.
This is at the heart of the case the Supreme Court heard on Tuesday, United States v. Sineneng-Smith. Current federal law criminalizes “encourage[ing] … an alien to … reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that such … residence is … in violation of law.” As the Cato Institute notes, this broad law could sweep up speech that ought to be protected under the First Amendment.
“There are people and organizations who urge illegal immigrants to stay in this country and wait for political change,” Cato’s amicus brief reads. “Lawyers will advise some immigrants — quite correctly, in many cases — that remaining in the country (illegally) will grant them certain constitutional or statutory protections that are unavailable outside the United States.”
Indeed, the plaintiff in the case, Evelyn Sineneng-Smith, was an immigration consultant rightfully convicted of fraud but additionally punished for encouraging illegal immigrants to remain in the country, seemingly exactly what you’d expect a pro-immigration advocate to do.
Reason’s Damon Root clearly lays out how easily this law could criminalize protected free speech:
For example, let's say that a self-described advocate of open borders writes a book urging civil disobedience in the face of what that author sees as America's unjust immigration regime. The book explicitly advises all undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States, to speak out, and to fight for their rights. Would the sale of such a book encourage the unlawful presence of undocumented immigrants for financial gain? Clearly, it would. But the First Amendment would just as clearly protect the author's liberty to write and sell such a book without facing federal charges.
This kind of censorship is unacceptable in a free society. It’s unconscionable that federal law would quash the ability of lawyers, advocates, and authors to express their ideas and make their arguments — yes, even arguments that border hawks don’t like.
At Tuesday's oral arguments, it appeared that some of the Supreme Court’s conservative justices, such as Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were sympathetic to the free speech claim, according to Reason's reporting. Kavanaugh wisely questioned whether this law would infringe on a charity’s ability to advertise its services for immigrants or help illegal immigrants stay in the country, and the government’s lawyers admitted that, yes, this is possible. Gorsuch, meanwhile, pointed out the glaring absurdity that the law actually imposes criminal penalties on speech that encourages offenses that are themselves only civil or administrative, not criminal, offenses.
Whether you personally favor lax or harsh immigration enforcement is really not of consequence here. Everyone should oppose overly broad laws that infringe on advocates’ abilities to make arguments on pressing political issues.

Texto completo: Texas Rep. John Ratcliffe accused fellow members of the House Intelligence Committee of leaking information from classified briefings.
The Republican lawmaker was asked to address the contradictory reports about Russia’s election interference strategy in 2020 during an appearance Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Ratcliffe argued the leaks were bad for the country and damaging to the work conducted by the U.S. Intelligence Community. He noted that all the information being discussed was supposed to be “classified.”
“It’s funny that we’re having a discussion about what is still a classified briefing, information behind closed doors, and you’re asking me about a report in the New York Times about what specifically was said,'' Ratcliffe explained. “I can’t tell you how many reporters have asked me to go into detail about it. It’s still classified.”
Ratcliffe stressed that it is illegal for him to discuss any part of a classified briefing, but yet, leaks have often sprung from House Intelligence Committee proceedings since President Trump has taken office.
“It would be a crime for me to give the specifics to this crowd right now, and yet everyone knows most of the details as you have now correctly laid them out,” Ratcliffe said. “Unfortunately, you just gave the most recent instance. This has happened for the last three years.”
He referenced “real-time” leaks from Donald Trump Jr.’s testimony that hit the press before he had even concluded his remarks related to the investigation into Trump’s campaign.
“You have folks that have access to classified information that are not treating it with the respect that it deserves,” Ratcliffe said. “So folks are real clear — when something gets classified at the top-secret level, it’s information that provides a grave national security risk if it’s out to the public, but it’s not being treated that way. And we have seen that, unfortunately, consistently since Donald Trump has been president of the United States.”
He added, “And ironically, or not so ironically. Why is it always the case when it’s information that’s allegedly damaging to Donald Trump. ... It’s a one-way street.”
Trump accused House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of leaking the story about Russia’s 2020 election plans, which included helping Trump get reelected in 2020, along with several other stories over the last few years. He justified his refusal to alert Congress about his raid to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani on the basis that he couldn’t trust Schiff not to leak the information.
Ratcliffe, who has been one of Trump’s most loyal supporters, claimed Schiff was helping Russia sow discord. The Texas Republican is again under consideration to be Trump's nominee for director of national intelligence after he dropped from consideration last year.

The Great Recession recovery wasn't powered by Obama; it was oil and gas

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama recently tried to take credit for President Trump’s record economic growth. Ironically enough, though, oil and gas development accounted for the vast majority of growth and job creation during the so-called Obama economy. Obama did nearly everything in his power to prevent that. Should Obama have his cake and eat it too?
Tweet
The economy under Obama averaged 2% gross domestic product growth; the “new normal," as New York Times opinion columnist Paul Krugman named it. To be fair, assuming office in the middle of a recession is no blessing, but Obama’s attachment to Keynesian economics prolonged the nation’s recovery.
In fact, Obama actively worked to restrict the industry that led the economy as a percentage of GDP growth. Oil and gas development accounted for nearly half of GDP growth, and the fracking boom alone accounted for 9.3 billion jobs, nearly half of the jobs created during his entire presidency. States such as Texas contributed nearly 70% of all jobs created during the Obama administration. Wage growth for workers in the natural gas industry also skyrocketed, with workers in states such as North Dakota seeing their weekly wages increase up to 40% in the post-shale boom. Without oil and gas development, there would have been almost no economic or job growth during the Obama administration.
Energy production laid the foundation for American energy independence. Off-shore drilling and the shale boom resulted in a decline in imports of foreign oil. By the end of the Obama years, the United States saw a 74% increase in oil production. By 2016, imports of foreign oil had declined by 4 million barrels since before Obama assumed office. Yet, it wasn’t until Trump implemented a laissez-faire approach to energy that America was finally able to achieve energy independence.
Obama, on the other hand, at the behest of far-left environmental groups such as the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, did everything he could to impede the fossil fuel industry via executive orders and overregulation. Regardless of Obama’s wavering support for the Keystone XL pipeline, for example, the industry and the economy saw tremendous growth thanks to its implementation.
By 2014, 98.5% of fracking occurred on nonfederal lands, yet the Obama administration attempted to seize more federal lands throughout his tenure. Permits for federal onshore extraction during the Obama administration declined. For all the talk of Russian meddling in U.S. affairs, there’s clear evidence the Kremlin funded the anti-fracking movement.
Obama’s push for renewable energy, which focused on wind and solar energy, failed to achieve market dominance. Crony schemes such as Solyndra wound up costing taxpayers even more. By the end of the Obama administration, renewables only contributed 10% of energy production.
A recent report by the International Energy Administration indicated that U.S. carbon emissions might have peaked — that’s without the Paris Climate Agreement, the Clean Power Plan, and abundant federal tax breaks and schemes to artificially prop up renewable energy.
Obama cannot take credit for the economic boom we are seeing under the Trump administration. It happened in spite of him, not because of him. The oil and gas boom powered the economic recovery from the Great Recession, not Obama’s attempts to stop it.

Texto completo: A few weeks ago, I told you not to panic about the coronavirus. No, that’s putting it too mildly. In the big, screaming urgency of a New York Times headline, I all but commanded you not to panic about the novel virus threatening to spread across the globe.
To be totally fair to myself, my reasoning in that column was mostly on point: At the time, the new coronavirus appeared to be a far less worrisome danger than the flu, which kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world annually. The illness, since named COVID-19, had then killed fewer than 200 people, and the Chinese government’s late but immense efforts to contain it looked as if they might work. The bigger worry, I argued, was the threat of mass overreaction and panic — and the restrictions on civil liberties, especially to those of immigrants and other vulnerable people, that a frightened world might accept to prevent the disease from spreading.
Events have not exactly been kind to my thesis. I still think mass panic is a grave threat, but now that the number of COVID-19 deaths has risen to thousands and the illness has appeared on several continents, I’m starting to get straightforwardly scared of the virus and its potential lethality, too. Am I panicking? Not really, not yet. But after watching the stock market plummet on Monday and governments struggling to get hold of the contagion, I’ve begun to smell doom. This weekend, idly, I found myself looking for N95 masks online, and my wife and I began reining in family vacation plans for the summer. It’s all a swift reversal from the insistent, don’t-worry tone of my last column.
Now, I’ve been a pundit for a long time, and I learned early on not to sweat being occasionally wrong about the future. I figure if I’m not wrong sometimes, I’m probably thinking too small. What I do regret about my virus column, though, is its dripping certainty. I wasn’t just pooh-poohing the virus’ threat; using the history of two other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS, as my guide, I all but guaranteed that this one, too, would more or less fizzle out.
In retrospect, my analytical mistake is obvious, and it’s a type of error that has become all too common across media, especially commentary on television and Twitter. My mistake was that I hadn’t properly accounted for what statisticians call tail risk, or the possibility of an unexpected “black swan” event that upends historical expectation.
A projection of certainty is often a crucial part of commentary; nobody wants to listen to a wishy-washy pundit. But I worry that unwarranted certainty, and an under-appreciation of the unknown, might be our collective downfall, because it blinds us to a new dynamic governing humanity: The world is getting more complicated, and therefore less predictable.
Yes, the future is always unknowable. But there’s reason to believe it’s becoming even more so, because when it comes to affairs involving masses of human beings — which is most things, from politics to markets to religion to art and entertainment — a range of forces is altering society in fundamental ways. These forces are easy to describe as Davos-type grand concepts: among others, the internet, smartphones, social networks, the globalization and interdependence of supply chains and manufacturing, the internationalization of culture, unprecedented levels of travel, urbanization and climate change. But their effects are not discrete. They overlap and intertwine in nonlinear ways, leaving chaos in their wake.
In the last couple of decades, the world has become unmoored, crazier, somehow messier. The black swans are circling; chaos monkeys have been unleashed. And whether we’re talking about the election, the economy, or most any other corner of humanity, we in the pundit class would do well more often to strike a note of humility in the face of the expanding unknown. We ought to add a disclaimer to everything we say: “I could be wrong! We all could be wrong!”
Since I don’t expect many of my commentating colleagues to do so, it’s best for you in the audience to remember this the next time you watch, say, veteran political pundits insisting that nominating Bernie Sanders would be insane: The world is strange! Odd things happen! And it’s possible, maybe even likely, that in 2020 nobody knows what they’re talking about. Like, at all.
I should note that there is some controversy about the thesis that black-swan events are increasing due to global complexity, and the claim is difficult to prove empirically. But there is theoretical backing to the idea that more-connected, complicated systems lead to more surprising, unexpected outcomes. And the claim makes sense intuitively, too. For instance, increased global connectivity is one of the reasons COVID-19 has been so hard to contain. (Authorities clearly weren’t prepared for the disease threat posed by the cruise industry, which has grown rapidly in China over the last decade.)
More than that, the growing unpredictability of human affairs is clear in the number of surprises we seem to be enduring lately. What was the 2008 financial crisis if not an out-of-the-blue event that stymied most prognosticators? Or, for that matter, the election of the first African American president, America’s hyper-fast flip on gay rights, Brexit, Donald Trump’s election, or the rise of Bernie Sanders?
And, sticking with politics, consider all the unknowns now clouding our picture of what might play out in 2020. Will Michael Bloomberg’s and Trump’s gargantuan levels of spending on digital ads substantially alter how elections work — or is it possible that we’re overhyping the role of ad spending? Will Americans really recoil from socialism, or do many of us not care so much about an outdated label? Will Sanders’ revolutionary army turn out, or stay home? Will our election survive malign interference or domestic ineptitude? How will the virus affect the economy and Americans’ sense of safety — and will that be good for Trump, or terrible for him?
I’ll lay my cards on the table: To me, Sanders is looking increasingly electable, the virus looks like it could reshape much of daily life at least in the short term, and the Trump administration’s response to it is bound to be bumbling and perhaps extremely scary.
Of course, I could be wrong. We all could be.

Texto completo: The question for today is, "What do you do?"
If you answer dentistry, plumbing, teaching the tango or any other noble profession, you're wrong.
The right answer is, "I do nothing."
Writer Olga Mecking does not do nothing, yet she is the author of "The Case for Doing Nothing," an article in The New York Times.
It is Mecking's opinion that a culture of busyness has taken over our lives. We are ruled by our to-do lists and judged by them, too. As result, "instances of burnout, anxiety disorders and stress-related diseases are on the rise."
(She also points to the damage done through "millennial burnout," but do we care about millennials? I didn't think so.)
The cure for being busy-busy-busy is "niksen." It's a Dutch word for doing nothing.
Psychologist Sandi Mann says niksen "literally makes us more creative, better at problem-solving, better at coming up with creative ideas."
Niksen is like "a car whose engine is running but isn't going anywhere" says Doreen Dodgen-Magee, a psychologist who studies boredom and who, if she really wants to plumb the depths of boredom, really should attend your next staff meeting.
One suggestion for integrating doing nothing with doing something is to take regular breaks during the workday. I agree. A good schedule for a typical day would be 15 minutes of work followed by three hours of break followed by lunch followed by nap followed by another 15 minutes of work. Spend the remainder of the day on break. Heaven knows you deserve it.
If you want to do less more, you will have to work on it. Here are some tips on how to do nothing successfully.
No. 1: "Make time for doing nothing, and do it with purpose."
According to productivity expert Chris Bailey, you need to "figure out when you're most productive and creative, then notice when your mind starts to shut off."
This should be an easy exercise for you. You're most productive and creative when you've just woken up and are desperately running through possible strategies for spending the day in bed. It is equally easy to determine when your mind starts to shut off. That occurs when you walk in the front door at work.
That's when you should go for a walk, according to Bailey. I concur. Start walking backward out the front door, saying a peppy "good morning" to your co-workers as you make your exit. That way, everyone will think you're coming in.
No. 2: "Resist the culture of busyness."
"When someone asks you what you're doing during a nothing break," Mecking writes, "simply respond, 'Nothing.'"
"Think of niksen not as a sign of laziness but as an important life skill."
Of course, if it's your manager who repeatedly asks you what you are doing, and she doesn't seem overly thrilled with you practicing an "important life skill" on her dime, you may have to modify your response.
You could explain the creative benefits of doing nothing, or you could remind her of all the mistakes you make when you're working and how much better it will be for the company if you do nothing. Or you could offer your manager a stroopwafel and a pannenkoeken, pushing back from your desk to show off your Delft-blue wooden shoes decorated with a painting of sunrise in Bunschoten.
"It's Dutch, boss," you say. "Live with it.
No. 3: "Manage your expectations."
"Don't get discouraged if you don't catch on immediately to the benefits of idleness," Mecking advises her readers, and this is true -- for some people. Fortunately, you've spent your entire working career mastering the art of doing nothing. In fact, you could quit today and start a lucrative new career teaching people how to do nothing. You could, that is, if it wasn't too much work.
No. 4: "Reorganize your environment."
"Your surroundings can have a major impact on how much nothingness you can embrace," is the advice to niksen amateurs. As an expert, you already embrace a heap of nothingness and should not have to make major changes, like reorganizing your home to "add a soft couch, a comfy armchair, a few cushions or just a blanket."

Texto completo: PARIS — On March 5, world renowned climate activist and New York Times best-selling author, Bill McKibben will share the stage in The Forum at Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School in Paris. This event, organized by the Center for an Ecology Based Economy (CEBE) in Norway, is the kickoff for CEBE’s two day Climate Action Convergence called 2020 Vision: Finding Hope in Climate Action happening in downtown Norway on the following Friday and Saturday, March 6-7.
Joining McKibben on the stage that night will be youth climate activist Anna Seigel of Maine Strikes and local artist and activist Jessica Cooper of CEBE and Maine Youth for Climate Justice. Doors will open at 6 p.m. with music by Otisfield’s 75 Scottys, and tabling by some of Maine’s premiere environmental organizations. Speakers will begin at 6:30 joined by western Maine poet Lisa Moore, and Portland-based singer-songwriter Emilia Dahlin.
Bill McKibben is a co-founder of the international climate action organization 350.org which has organized over 20,000 climate rallies around the world in every country except North Korea, and galvanized the ongoing resistance to the Keystone XL pipeline. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Prize, often called the alternative Nobel, in 2014.
McKibben has written 12 books as well as countless essays on the climate and ecological crisis for publications including National Geographic, The New York Review of Books, and the New Yorker where he was a staff writer. His 1989 best seller, The End of Nature was one of the first popular books to expose the threat of global warming to a general audience.
It has since been translated into 24 languages. His seminal 2012 Rolling Stone essay, Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math shined a light on the disparity between our global carbon budget if we are to prevent catastrophic warming of over 2 degrees Celsius, and the proven fossil fuel reserves of the major oil, coal and gas companies and petro-states that represent five times that budget if burned. It was a clarion call for the climate movement.
“We know how much we can burn,” he stated, “and we know who’s planning to burn more. Climate change…[is] not an impersonal force of nature; the more carefully you do the math, the more thoroughly you realize that this is, at bottom, a moral issue…”
McKibben’s current book Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? explores the relationship between the climate emergency, artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. This book will be available for signing at the event from The Tribune book store in Norway. McKibben is currently working to foster a movement to divest banks, pensions, and other institutions from fossil fuels as an organizer of StopTheMoneyPipeline.com.
On Friday March 6, Mr. McKibben will be meeting with youth activists before a full day of training, support, action and celebration for climate organizers and activists. On Saturday March 7, the general public is invited to find their own place in the climate movement.
To learn more about this event, please visit CEBE at www.ecologybasedeconomy.org or find 2020 Vision Norway on Eventbrite to register.

Texto completo: A well-known Dayton psychologist who for years was a leading voice on issues of child endangerment and exploitation was arrested Thursday on 145 charges related to child pornography.
Dr. Greg Ramey, a former long-time Dayton Children’s Hospital employee, was charged with 145 criminal counts, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed in Greene County.
Ramey, 70, of Beavercreek, turned himself into the Greene County Jail on Thursday morning, according to the AG’s office. Bond was set at $500,000, according to the Greene County Clerk of Courts.
“This egregious abuse of the patients’ trust, not to mention the public’s trust, from a doctor is gut-wrenchingly horrible,” said Attorney General Dave Yost in a written statement. “Young children are innocent, sweet and trusting – vulnerably fragile and in need of special protection.”
In an interview with the Dayton Daily News, Yost said “We are talking about multiple children, more than 40 (victims.)” The images do not appear to be generated from his practice, he added.
Dayton Children’s Hospital, where Ramey worked from 1979 until his termination Aug. 16, 2019, cooperated with investigators, the AG’s office said.
The hospital issued a statement about Ramey that said in part: “…we were blindsided by the allegations of inappropriate behavior in his personal life. Nothing in the performance of his professional role created any suspicions. We are shocked and deeply troubled by these allegations, which are in stark contrast to our mission and core values. To be clear, the charges do not include any activity at Dayton Children’s, nor was any inappropriate material found on or accessed via Dayton Children’s devices.”
Ramey had served as executive director for pediatric mental health resources at Dayton Children’s.
The hospital added: “We are relentless advocates of protecting our most vulnerable population. There is simply no place for any behavior that exploits children. We will continue to work diligently on that front.”
An indictment filed in Greene County Common Pleas Court charges Ramey with 145 felony counts:
— Illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material, a second degree felony, counts 1-90;
— Pandering obscenity involving a minor, a fourth degree felony, counts 91-117;
— Attempted pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor, a fifth degree felony, counts 118-142;
— Tampering with evidence, a third degree felony, counts 143-145.

RameyIndictment (Text)
An indictment is an accusation that prosecutors must prove in court.
Ramey was identified as the source of electronic downloads of child pornography and Ramey’s activity was reported to the Ohio Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, according to the AG’s office.
The indictment alleges that between Jan. 1, 2012 and July 29, 2019, Ramey photographed or transferred photos of nude minors, bought or possessed obscene material and attempted to buy obscene material. From July 1, 2019 to Aug. 8, 2019, Ramey knew of the investigation and tried to alter, destroy or hide evidence, the indictment alleges.
Yost said pedophiles often trade child pornography over the Internet via the dark web and/or overseas websites.
The complaint was handled by the Ohio Attorney General’s office after Greene County Stephen Haller referred a complaint involving Ramey to the AG due to a conflict of interest issue. Haller’s office works closely with Dayton Children’s and Michael’s House, a Fairborn-based nonprofit that provides treatment and works as a liaison for children who may be crime victims.
Beavercreek police visited Ramey’s home July 31 but the police report didn’t disclose the reason. Greene County property records indicate Ramey owns a $305,550 home on Freedom Pointe.
Ramey started at Dayton Children’s in 1979. The pediatric psychologist was one of the public faces of Dayton Children’s, writing a weekly parenting column in the Dayton Daily News that was distributed on the New York Times wire service, and making frequent appearances in local and outside media.
He was also with the Wright State Department of Pediatrics as division chief for pediatric psychology.
He holds a doctoral degree in psychology from University of Massachusetts Amherst, according to his LinkedIn page. State records show he has held a psychologist license in Ohio since Dec. 6, 1980. His license is still active, according to the state license website, and no board action has been taken on it.

Líderes demócratas están dispuestos a llegar lejos para frenar el ascenso de Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: La alarma en el seno del partido demócrata ante la posible victoria de Bernie Sanders en las primarias llegan desde todas las direcciones. Tanto la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, como el líder de la minoría en el Senado, Chuck Schumer, escuchan frecuentemente advertencias que apuntan a la pérdida de la mayoría demócrata en la Cámara baja si Sanders es el candidato en noviembre. Pero, ¿en que se basan esos miedos?
The New York Times entrevistó después de las votaciones de Nevada a 93 cargos del partido demócrata que son además superdelegados. Todos ellos -en total hay 771- pueden tener un peso decisivo para elegir el candidato que se enfrentará a Donald Trump , independientemente de quien sea el más votado por los inscritos demócratas. El diario neoyorquino asegura que encontró un apabullante consenso de todos en oponerse a Sanders.
Los entrevistados sugirieron al prestigioso periódico que están dispuestos incluso a arriesgarse a dañar al partido con tal de frenar al autodenominado socialista demócrata . Esta situación podría llevar a una convención negociada, una complicada batalla política que no ha ocurrido desde 1952 con Adlai Stevenson como candidato.

Texto completo: La alarma en el seno del partido demócrata ante la posible victoria de Bernie Sanders en las primarias llegan desde todas las direcciones. Tanto la presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi, como el líder de la minoría en el Senado, Chuck Schumer, escuchan frecuentemente advertencias que apuntan a la pérdida de la mayoría demócrata en la Cámara baja si Sanders es el candidato en noviembre. Pero, ¿en que se basan esos miedos?
The New York Times entrevistó después de las votaciones de Nevada a 93 cargos del partido demócrata que son además superdelegados. Todos ellos -en total hay 771- pueden tener un peso decisivo para elegir el candidato que se enfrentará a Donald Trump , independientemente de quien sea el más votado por los inscritos demócratas. El diario neoyorquino asegura que encontró un apabullante consenso de todos en oponerse a Sanders.
Los entrevistados sugirieron al prestigioso periódico que están dispuestos incluso a arriesgarse a dañar al partido con tal de frenar al autodenominado socialista demócrata . Esta situación podría llevar a una convención negociada, una complicada batalla política que no ha ocurrido desde 1952 con Adlai Stevenson como candidato.
Aunque el congresista superdelegado de Connecticut, Jim Himes, le ha dicho al Times que “ya pasó el tiempo en el que los líderes del partido determinen los resultados”, al mismo tiempo reconoce que “algo se debe hacer”. Compañeros suyos de todo el país apoyan esa teoría. Sanders ataca esta estrategia asegurando que implicaría que el partido niega la voluntad de los votantes .
Jay Jacobs, jefe del partido demócrata neoyorquino, acusa a Sanders de querer “redefinir las reglas [del partido] y dice que solo necesita una mayoría simple”. Y añade que el aparato del partido “no compra eso. Si no tiene mayoría (más de la mitad de los delegados), es lógico que no se convierta en el candidato “.
Estas son las reglas que el partido estableció hace dos años y que, según The Times, el equipo de Sanders ayudó a redactar. El diario también afirma que la postura actual del político progresista es contraría a la que él mismo tuvo en 2016 cuando, aparentemente, animó a los superdelegados a votar a su favor y en contra de Hillary Clinton .
El senador de Vermont, es hasta ahora el principal ganador de las primarias que se han celebrado -en Iowa, ganó el voto popular- y las encuestas lo sitúan a la cabeza de la contienda -alguna de ellas con más de 10 puntos de diferencia con el rival que le sigue-. Sanders insiste que, aunque sus opositores aseguran que sus medidas son radicales, el “seguro médico para todos” y la matriculación gratuita en la educación superior ya funciona desde hace décadas en otros países ricos.

Texto completo: In case you were at all confused, Bernie Sanders is the apocalypse. Or something very close to it.
That was the message from his six rivals on Tuesday night at the latest and perhaps nastiest Democratic debate, which devolved at times into an oratorical melee of overlapping voices, overheated tempers and dire warnings about what would happen if Sanders, the current front-runner in the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, becomes the party’s nominee. President Donald Trump would get four more years. Several of the Democrats on the stage in Charleston, South Carolina, essentially guaranteed it.
And they scared the hell out of me. That’s only partly because I fear that they’re right about Sanders, whose past and even present are gold mines for material that Trump can use to portray him as an ideological fringe figure. It’s also because the candidates did it in an angry, panicked way that, if I were Trump, I’d edit into a campaign commercial and blanket the airwaves. Its tag line would be: “Even Democrats don’t trust Bernie Sanders. Why should you?”
Nomination contests often get ugly, with candidates in the same party — candidates with some of the same core values — belittling one another. But this felt different. This felt worse. This felt like a genuine freakout.
Sanders’ competitors weren’t just desperate to reverse his progress before Super Tuesday next week, when roughly a third of all delegates are awarded, so that one of them can overtake him. They seemed to be in the grip of some larger existential crisis, their understanding of their party’s dynamics challenged, their sense of its destiny upended and their dread of blowing an immeasurably consequential election profound.
Within the first 15 minutes, Mike Bloomberg attacked Sanders and then Elizabeth Warren did, and then Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden and Tom Steyer got in on the action. Amy Klobuchar joined the fray late but with no less exuberance. Together they pressed the case that Sanders’ proposals — for health care, education and more — were too uncompromising, too disruptive and too expensive, and that he had shown an inexplicable, suspicious softness toward authoritarian regimes around the world.
A few of them made clear that they don’t merely see Sanders as a less-than-ideal adversary for Trump. They see him as political suicide.
And as the candidates gave voice to that dark vision, they occasionally vaulted past fierce to feral. There were episodes when they spoke over one another, not just for a few sentences but for entire paragraphs, while the journalists moderating the debate watched helplessly. The worst of these involved Sanders and Buttigieg, who perhaps devoted the most energy to sounding the Sanders alarm.
After Bloomberg charged that Russians were interfering in the primary on Sanders’ behalf as a way of handing Trump his weakest opponent, Buttigieg chimed in: “They want chaos, and chaos is what is coming our way. I mean, look, if you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs. Donald Trump. Think about what that will be like for this country.”
He later told Sanders that his nomination would jeopardize Democrats’ hard-won control of the House, saying that the scores of Democrats whose victories in 2018 gave the party its majority “are not running on your platform. They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.”
Sanders, red-faced, shook his head. He did so much of that on Tuesday night it was as if he were a pioneer in neck aerobics.
But he also kept his cool and stood his ground, so that a night devoted in large part to wounding him probably left him with little more than a nick or two. He was able to say, correctly, that he beats Trump in polls that posit a hypothetical matchup of the two. He was able to cite, accurately, his impressive favorability ratings.
He was also able to step back during stretches of the debate when the ugliness didn’t focus on him — when the generally foul atmosphere pitted Biden against Steyer or Warren against Bloomberg, or Klobuchar against Biden.
Nobody really looked good, and that’s another big part of what spooked me. I was watching a political party devour itself. It was all so unpleasant — and so unflattering — that candidates took to commenting on how unpleasant and unflattering it was.
“I guess the only way you do this is to jump in and speak twice as long as you should,” Biden groused, as he delivered yet another debate performance in which he was obsessed with the clock, the rules and whether he should follow them when others didn’t.
Klobuchar cautioned: “If we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we’re going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart.” But before I could cheer, she proceeded to tear Sanders down. That’s the bind that she and other moderate Democrats are in. To press for a nominee less divisive than Sanders, they’re forced to behave in a manner that’s, well, divisive. It’s a Catch-22. Make that a Catch-2020.
The debate wasn’t just scary but sad, because when the vitriol waned, there were glimpses of just how much more prudent and better prepared than Trump all of these candidates are. There were glimmers of just how much more serious than the Republican Party the Democratic Party is.
Asked about the threat of the coronavirus, the candidates spoke authoritatively and compellingly about the Trump administration’s missteps and America’s vulnerability. They discussed science, something with which Trump has barely any relationship. They mentioned international cooperation, something for which Trump has scant respect.
Bloomberg, so awful when he made his debate debut last week, answered a question about public health and then a subsequent one about the legalization of marijuana in a nuanced, knowledgeable fashion, demonstrating that Trump’s problem isn’t that he’s a plutocrat. It’s that he’s an ignorant one.
But do Democrats have the antidote to that ignorance? I fervently believe that the vigor and durability of our democracy depend on it, and the debate’s rancor and noise filled me with apprehension.
Maybe there’s solace in Sanders’ final remarks, when he quoted Nelson Mandela: “Everything is impossible until it happens.” He meant that as an answer to his candidacy’s detractors. But I’ll interpret it as an assertion that Democrats will find their way through this mess.

Texto completo: Un informante secreto asegura que el departamento de Salud y Recursos Humanos (HHS, por sus siglas en inglés) envió para recibir a las personas evacuadas de China a trabajadores sanitarios que no tenían formación ni indumentaria adecuada para manejar posibles casos de coronavirus .
La reclamación fue presuntamente dirigida este miércoles a la Oficina del Asesor Especial, según publicó The Washington Post. El denunciante es un alto cargo de HHS afincado en Washington y que busca protección federal porque, asegura, que fue r easignado injustamente -junto a otros funcionarios- después de expresar sus preocupaciones sobre la seguridad de los mencionados trabajadores.
Los trabajadores no mostraron síntomas y tampoco fueron sometidos a revisiones médicas , de acuerdo a la información que el Post dice haber recibido de de los abogados del denunciantes. The New York Times agrega que el personal sanitario expuesto al coronavirus no tuvieron limitación de viaje alguna .
Los hechos ocurrieron cuando EEUU ordenó evacuar a los estadounidenses que estaban en Wuhan, China, en el momento que se desató el virus.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Clive Cussler, the million-selling adventure writer and real-life thrill-seeker who wove personal details and spectacular fantasies into his page-turning novels about underwater explorer Dirk Pitt, has died.
Cussler died Monday at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz., said Alexis Welby, spokeswoman for publisher Penguin Random House. He was 88.
The cause was not disclosed.
Cussler dispatched Pitt and pal Al Giordino on exotic missions highlighted by shipwrecks, treachery, espionage and beautiful women, in popular works including "Cyclops,'' "Night Probe!" and his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!"
Cussler was an Illinois native who was raised in Southern California and lived in Arizona for most of his final years, but he sent Pitt around the globe in plots that ranged from the bold to the incredible. "The Treasure" features an aspiring Aztec despot who murders an American envoy, the hijacking of a plane carrying the United Nations secretary-general and soldiers from ancient Rome looting the Library of Alexandria. In "Iceberg," the presidents of French Guiana and the Dominican Republic are the ones in danger, during a visit to Disneyland. In "Sahara," a race across the desert somehow leads to new information about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
"Again and again, Dirk Pitt, working for the fictional National Underwater and Marine Agency, must find a sunken vessel and retrieve some artifact," Mark Schone, summarizing Cussler's novels, wrote in The New York Times in 2004. "Evil forces, be they Commies or Blofeldian madmen, try to stop him. Along the way Pitt saves himself, the world and the damsel of the moment."
Cussler has a new novel, "Journey of the Pharaohs," set to be released March 10, with several more awaiting posthumous publication.
In real life, Cussler founded his own National Underwater and Marine Agency and participated in dozens of searches for old ships, including one that turned up a steamship belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt. He also had a long history of questionable claims - some admitted, some denied.
"He can definitely spin the tall tales and is a master of fiction. But that doesn't mean I buy into his alleged discovery claims," Dr. E. Lee Spence wrote on his blog in 2011. Spence, a prominent underwater archaeologist feuded with Cussler over which of them recovered a Confederate submarine.
Born an only child in 1931 in Aurora, Illinois, and raised in Alhambra, California, Cussler's name and writing persona have the air of a pseudonym, but he was born with his moniker, named for the British actor Clive Brook. He studied for two years at Pasadena City College before enlisting in the Air Force and serving as a mechanic and flight engineer during the Korean War.
In 1955, he married Barbara Knight, with whom he had three children. Through much of the 1960s, he worked in advertising, as a copywriter and creative director. Among the better known slogans he helped coin - "It's stronger than dirt," for an Ajax laundry detergent campaign.
In his free time, he was writing fiction and moonlighting at a skin-diving equipment shop, where his wife suggested he work to help gather material for his novels.
"When creating advertising, I had always looked at the competition and wondered what I could conceive that was totally different," Cussler said in an interview included in "Dirk Pitt Revealed," a nonfiction book released in 1998. "(James) Bond was becoming incredibly popular through the movies, and I knew I couldn't match Ian Fleming's style and prose. So I was determined not to write about a detective, secret agent or undercover investigator or deal in murder mysteries. My hero's adventures would be based on and under water."
Cussler finished manuscripts for "Mediterranean Caper" and "Iceberg," but had no literary agent: so he created one. He purchased a thousand sheets of blank letter paper, got a friend in advertising to design a logo for "The Charles Winthrop Agency" and sent his first inquiry to Peter Lampack of the William Morris Agency. Lampack agreed to take on Cussler and remained with him long after the author confessed his charade.
"I told him the story of Charlie Winthrop with great trepidation," Cussler explained to the Arizona Republic. "I sat there waiting for the result, and he sat there blank for a minute, and then he laughed himself under the table. And he said, 'Oh my God. I always thought Charlie Winthrop was some guy I met while I was drunk at a cocktail party.'"
"Mediterranean Caper" came out in 1973, followed by "Iceberg" two years later and "Raise the Titanic!" in 1976. He would turn out more than 20 Dirk Pitt novels and expand into children's books and such adventure series as "The Oregon Files" and "The Numa Files."
Cussler had claimed his worldwide sales topped 100 million copies, but in a legal battle with Crusader Entertainment, which alleged he had misrepresented his popularity, it was determined the number was closer to 40 million. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded Crusader $5 million but also ordered that Cussler receive $8.5 million because the film company only adapted one ("Sahara") of the two books it had agreed to produce.
The film version of "Sahara" came out in 2005 and starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz. An adaptation of "Raise the Titanic!" - its title the same except for dropping the exclamation point, came out in 1980 and featured Jason Robards and Alec Guinness.
In recent years, Cussler began working with co-authors and collaborated with his son on "Poseidon's Arrow," "Crescent Dawn" and "Arctic Drift." Cussler's son is Dirk Cussler. Pitt himself had a son, called, of course, Dirk Pitt Jr.
In addition to Dirk Cussler, the author is survived by his second wife, Janet, daughters Teri and Dayna, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: Regarding Jason L. Riley's " A Bid to Revise the New York Times's Bad History " (Upward Mobility, Feb. 19): Slavery was always a curse, never a boon, for the U.S. economy, though it certainly enriched slaveholders. Slaves made important contributions, but slavery itself grossly depressed their productivity, and the productivity of many whites, as became abundantly clear when the freed slaves did more than their fair share to spur the record U.S. economic growth of the post-Civil War period.
Slavery was a dystopic form of socialism where slaves faced 100% taxation and received compensation only "according to their needs," as determined by slaveholders. The end of slavery eliminated these horrible disincentives and inefficiencies, and can be viewed as the largest, most successful targeted tax cut in U.S. history. America succeeded despite slavery, not because of it, and only began to hit its stride when slaves were free at last.
Much of the confusion about slavery stems from the erroneous assumption that the economy is a zero-sum system. We'll never know just how much talent was squandered under the oppression of slavery. Economics is more about cooperation than competition; human wealth is inherently shared and generally magnified every time one of us freely sells, buys or invests. Slavery, which sabotaged full-scale cooperation, wasted tremendous abilities, was indeed a horrifying curse. Yet, the slaves and their progeny, have been a tremendous blessing.

Texto completo: Award-winning author and wildlife photographer Paul Bannick will present a program featuring stunning imagery from his new book: "The Owl and the Woodpecker: Encounters with North America's Most Iconic Birds" at special presentations at J.N. "Ding' Darling National Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island. The two free programs on Friday, March 6, take place at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., part of the 2020 "Ding" Darling Friday Lecture series.
Based on thousands of hours in the field photographing, Bannick's book evokes all 41 North American species of owls and woodpeckers, across 11 key habitats. By revealing the impact of two of our most iconic birds, he has created a unique approach to birding and conservation.
"The 'Owl and the Woodpecker' is a monumental work of photojournalism by one of North America's top wildlife photographers," wrote Ted Williams, an editor at Audubon magazine. "The images you'll encounter in this book are the result of an encyclopedic knowledge of birds and their habitats, an intense love of nature, and endless patience."
Bannick also authored the bestselling "Owl: A Year in the Lives of North American Owls" and gave presentations on it last season at "Ding" Darling to full houses. His work has been featured prominently in bird guides from Audubon, Peterson, The Smithsonian, Stokes, The National Wildlife Federation, and Birds of the World; and has appeared in a variety of publications from The New York Times and Birds and Blooms to American Way and the Seattle Times.
Bannick has appeared on NBC Nightly News, Evening Magazine, and dozens of NPR stations and programs, including Travels with Rick Steves and BirdNote.
The author-photographer will sign copies of his books, available in the Refuge Nature Store, following the two lectures. Profits from Nature Store sales directly benefit refuge education and research.
HighTower/Thomas & Swartz Wealth Management and Sanibel Carts co-sponsor the free 12-lecture series with support from the "Ding" Darling Wildlife Society-Friends of the Refuge (DDWS). The free lectures take place every Friday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Seating is limited and available on a first-come basis. Staff will begin handing out free-admission wristbands to those in line for the lectures at 9 a.m. for the morning lecture and 11:30 for the afternoon lecture. Wristband wearers can save seats with personal items and then can explore the Visitor & Education Center or Indigo Trail before the lecture starts. Saved seats must be filled 15 minutes before lecture.
As usual, Wildlife Drive closes on Friday, but visitors are welcome to enjoy the Visitor & Education Center, Indigo Trail, Bailey Tract, and recreational opportunities at Tarpon Bay Explorers, the refuge's official recreation concession located at its Tarpon Bay Recreation Area.

Texto completo: The University of Southern California systematically failed to protect students from a predatory university gynecologist and now must make sweeping changes to its procedures for handling sexual discrimination complaints, the U. S. Department of Education announced Thursday.
Former USC gynecologist George Tyndall had been able to sexually abuse female students since as far back as 1989 because the university repeatedly failed to respond appropriately to notices of possible misconduct, officials said as they announced the results of their investigation.
"This total and complete failure to protect students is heartbreaking and inexcusable," U. S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement.
One of the largest sexual misconduct investigations
A new agreement between the department and USC now requires the university to overhaul its processes for following Title IX — the federal law that prohibits sexual discrimination in education. It also requires the university to conduct a formal review of current and former employees and to allow government oversight for three years.
The agreement caps the government's two-year investigation into Tyndall and the university — one of the largest sexual misconduct investigations ever undertaken by the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights, said Kenneth Marcus, assistant secretary for civil rights.
“The facts in this case are extraordinarily egregious,” Marcus told reporters Thursday. “It’s one of the most shocking cases we have ever seen. "
The Los Angeles Times was the first to report in 2018 on allegations against Tyndall, and an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department resulted in Tyndall's arrest last summer. He was charged with sexually assaulting multiple patients at the campus center.
Tyndall pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Separate from the government's Title IX investigation, a number of Tyndall's former patients brought lawsuits.
Lawsuits against Tyndall: Former student patients said USC doctor told them to 'strip naked'
This week, a court gave final approval to USC's $215 million class-action settlement with Tyndall's former patients who accused him of abuse or assault. Each former patient is entitled to at least $2,500 and some will get much more. In total, the university could make payments to more than 18,000 women who say they saw Tyndall at some point during their time in college, according to The New York Times.
Marcus said the government's investigation into USC and Tyndall involved interviewing 93 or 94 people — more people than the department interviewed when it investigated Michigan State University for a sexual abuse case involving its former university doctor, Larry Nassar.
Nassar, who continued his career as a coach for USA Gymnastics, was sentenced to federal prison in 2018 for sexually abusing hundreds of gymnasts.
Larry Nassar sentenced: 40 to 175 years in prison in sexual assault cases
The Department of Education fined Michigan State $4. 5 million last fall and also demanded major internal changes because of the university's failure to respond appropriately to sexual assault complaints against Nassar.
USC knew Tyndall had photographed patients' genitals
The Office of Civil Rights started its investigation into Title IX compliance at USC in May 2018. It found numerous violations, the department said, including the following:
The university didn't maintain a record-keeping system to identify and monitor incidents of possible sex discrimination by its employees.
The university failed to investigate complaints against Tyndall from five patients between 2000 and 2009, and it had notice of possible mistreatment by four more patients that it also failed to investigate.
The university discovered 200 photographs of patients' genitals in Tyndall's office in 2016, yet failed to investigate whether photographing the patients and keeping the pictures constituted sex discrimination. USC also failed to take steps to locate the remaining photographs Tyndall admitted to taking.
In 2016, the university failed to investigate complaints that Tyndall conducted pelvic examinations without gloves, and also failed to investigate complaints regarding Tyndall penetrating patients with his fingers during full-body skin checks.
As part of the resolution agreement, USC must now ensure its Title IX coordinator and Title IX office have the independent authority to respond to sex discrimination cases. The university also must track and monitor complaints, contact the former patients who complained about Tyndall and also reach out to current and former employees who interacted with him.
Marcus would not specify exactly how many victims the department believed had been abused. Nine gave notice to the university and became part of the investigation, he said.
"This was ongoing from 1989 to approximately 2016, so there are a large number of potentially affected individuals," he said.

Market panic means little for those left out of stock gains

Texto completo: Monday's 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America's real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors and enabling President Donald Trump to claim that "our economy is the best it has ever been." Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what's happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market," says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. "But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What really matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education."
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 per hour, picking up trash from sports fans who may pay hundreds of dollars to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single mothers in the United States, 29% live in poverty. Most do not have college educations and could not afford one even if they wanted a four-year degree.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with ever higher deductibles and co-pays.
Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, today's stock market decline does mean a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce, not counted in official unemployment statistics. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can't afford to rent a small apartment.
The Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on the Chinese economy – and potential impact on the global economy – are cited as the major reasons for Monday's stock market sell-off.
However, it is poor, low-wage and even many middle-class Americans who are more likely to be in poor health and have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those who have higher incomes and are well educated. The richest American men live 15 years longer than the poorest.
A huge collapse in the stock market makes little difference to them. How could it, if one is behind on one's bills, has a broken-down car, needs food stamps to eat and Medicaid to get health care.
Conversely, a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones is not going to stop the wealthiest Americans from buying homes around the world and a yacht or private jet where they can drink Dom Perignon. As inequality has grown, the top one-fifth of earners account for about 55% on the nation's annual income. By comparison, the bottom 20% account for just 4% of all income.
Since investments in equities represent wealth, the wealth comparisons are even more glaring. The top 1% hold nearly 40% of the country's wealth, significantly more than the middle 60% of the income distribution. If those at the top bewail the millions in stock-market investments wiped out Monday, remember: 2 out of 5 households do not have enough savings to make ends meet for three months at the poverty level if they had no income.
Let's make the distinction: Today was an awful day for investors, but too many Americans don't have the savings to participate in the stock market at all. For them, today's trillion dollar economic calamity means little.

Texto completo: I’m the quintessential moderate Democrat. I spent countless hours volunteering for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The temperate Barack Obama of the 2012 election excited me far more than the inspirational Barack Obama of the 2008 election. I may think "Medicare for All" is good policy, but I also think it’s a pipe dream and an unnecessary purity test. I think low-hanging fruit is a positive description, not a negative one.
I also have my doubts about Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. His grasp of policy — even policies, like breaking up big banks, which he has talked about for decades — has been shaky. Some of his plans miss the mark. His proposal to cancel student loan debt, for instance, is a redistribution to the upper-middle class. The math behind his plans to pay for his ambitious proposals is, at best, optimistic.
I don’t want Sen. Sanders to be the Democratic nominee. Yet if he is, he will have my vigorous, unambiguous support. I will donate, I will volunteer, and I will vote. My fellow moderates must make the same promise. America will be better off under a “President Sanders. ”
Trump would be the only alternative
The first reason is the most obvious — if Sen. Sanders is the nominee, the only alternative is President Donald Trump. There will be no third-party savior. Wisely or not, our system is set up for two-candidate elections. The last serious third-party candidate, Ross Perot, received roughly 20% of the popular vote in 1992. He received zero electoral votes.
If Sen. Sanders is the only realistic alternative to President Trump, then, we have to compare him with President Trump. Despite the grumbling, Sanders is a far better option.
Consider the most egregious sins of the Trump administration — family separation, support for white nationalists, siding with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin over the U. S. intelligence community, disregard for the rule of law, attempts to undermine future elections, and giving powerful positions to people who are incompetent, immoral or both. Let alone the administration’s half-baked proposals to get rid of birthright citizenship or build a wall that blows over when it’s windy.
These are the sorts of sins that undermine American democracy itself, that are an existential threat to America as we know it. Sen. Sanders — like any Democrat — would put an end to all of them immediately. White nationalists would go back to their caves and Central American children would be released from their cages; Putin would lose all sway over the White House; Betsy DeVos would no longer be a Cabinet-level secretary.
Bernie Sanders is wrong about Cuba: Does that make him worse than Trump?
A President Sanders could also begin to rebalance a judiciary that has moved far to the right during the Trump administration. We need to protect not only the Supreme Court — though liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg (age 86) and Stephen Breyer (age 81) are closer to the end of their terms than the beginning — but also circuit courts and district courts, where President Trump has placed 50 and 133 judges, respectively.
With another four years, conservatives would have an unbreakable judicial majority for a generation. Moderates understand the importance of incremental change, and progressive judges are critical to that process.
10% solution is better than no solution
Further, a President Sanders would expand — rather than curtail — civil rights. The past four years have seen expanded use of “voter ID” laws, an attempt to suppress minority response to the census through a “citizenship question,” a curtailing of legal immigration and a travel ban targeting Muslims, not to mention the effective end of the Voting Rights Act.
Moderates believe that the best change happens in the voting booth, rather than by executive fiat. When people cannot vote, however, that ceases to be the case.
Finally, our political system would likely curtail a President Sanders’ most far-reaching impulses. As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman argued, the general public — let alone the Senate — wouldn’t go along with Medicare for All, massive deficit-funded spending increases, large cuts to military spending or total student loan forgiveness.
Yes, there are policy areas where President Sanders would have wide latitude — mostly regulatory enforcement of financial and environmental standards — but that would be little more than a corrective to a Trump administration that has all but ended regulatory enforcement.
Vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump: I worked hard for McGovern and he was doomed. Sanders backers, please don't repeat 1972.
We moderates pride ourselves on realism and incrementalism. We understand that a 50% solution — or even a 10% solution — is better than no solution at all. We are not ideologues. We pursue the best available options, not the best options we can dream up.
Now is not the time for us moderates to become our own form of ideologues. We need to be more realist than ever before. If we are worried about electability, we should by all means work to nominate another Democrat. Yet if he is the nominee, we need to support Bernie Sanders with every ounce of fight we have within us.

Rose will start as Knicks president on Sunday, nearly one month after his predecessor Steve Mills was fired, according to the New York Times.
Rose, the longtime power agent at Creative Artists Agency, will then be tasked with assembling a staff and preparing for the draft and free agency. The reason for the delay was that Rose was taking care of his clients and duties as an agent before decertifying.
The Knicks are enduring a seventh consecutive losing season and Rose will represent the fifth team president since Isiah Thomas was fired in 2008. Rose, who is from Cherry Hill, N.J., is expected to consider Tom Thibodeau for head coach. Thibodeau is a CAA client and worked closely with Rose.
Another CAA client, Allan Houston, is expected to be retained in the front office with increased responsibilities, according to a source. The Knicks currently employ several others in the scouting department and front office who were either holdovers from previous eras or were brought in by GM Scott Perry.
The player development department, led by Craig Robinson, has been the major blemish on this regime.
Rose has represented some of the biggest stars in the NBA, including LeBron James, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony and Joel Embiid. His hire is part of a movement by NBA teams to place agents in executive roles, with success stories already in Golden State with Bob Myers, Utah with Justin Zanik and the Lakers with Rob Pelinka.

Texto completo: Recently the intelligence community made clear it will be a player in the 2020 presidential election. No one should be surprised.
On February 13, the House Intelligence Committee held a meeting at which intel officials briefed lawmakers on foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections. By several accounts, the officials told the committee that Russia is working to re-elect President Trump.
A number of Republican committee members were deeply skeptical. What the officials said was classified, so they cannot discuss it publicly, but in conversations later, GOP lawmakers made it clear that the intel officials did not have the evidence to support their assertion.
"How should reporting take place?" one member said later. "You would say, ‘We believe X is true based on A, B, C and D.’ When that doesn’t happen, it’s very suspect."
"If you’re going to make an accusation like that, you darn well better be ready to answer questions and have evidence to support it," said another member. When pressed, the member added, officials gave "very vague and unsatisfying answers."
The Republicans’ objection was not to the idea that Russia is trying to interfere in a U.S. election. That is an accepted fact. The problem was the assessment that Russia is specifically trying to help re-elect Trump. That claim, so incendiary in the 2016 election, was unsupported by the evidence, they said.
As they left the meeting, Republicans agreed that the news would leak soon. It almost seemed to be why Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, the committee chairman and impeachment leader, had called the meeting in the first place.
No one was surprised when, a week later, The New York Times published a story headlined "Lawmakers Are Warned That Russia Is Meddling to Re-elect Trump." The news quickly became another one of those bombshell reports that consume hours of talk on cable TV.
Democrats, who were also barred by law from revealing classified information, were nevertheless happy to play along. For example, not long after the story broke, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, an Intelligence Committee member, appeared on CNN.
"I can’t talk about what happened in a classified setting," Himes said. "But ... you don’t need an intelligence briefing to think about what Vladimir Putin might want. Would he want a return to sort of conventional, much more confrontational policy with respect to Russia? Or might he want a president who will criticize everybody on the planet except Vladimir Putin?"
Himes’s point was clear: I can’t talk about it, but of course Putin is working to re-elect Trump.
The problem was, intel officials did not have the evidence to make that assertion. And almost as soon as the story broke, officials with knowledge of the meeting suggested that the headlines were wrong. On Sunday, CNN reported that officials apparently had "overstated" the Putin-wants-Trump story.
And then there were the circumstances of the briefing. The intelligence community works for the president. Yet officials chose to brief Chairman Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee on this extraordinarily consequential finding before telling the president. Whatever the motive, spilling the beans in a room with dozens of people present — intel officials brought a lot of staff with them — increased the chances of precisely the type of leak that occurred.
The whole thing hit the White House by surprise. "I have not seen that analysis," national security adviser Robert O’Brien told ABC Sunday, referring to the Putin-wants-Trump assessment. "I’ve been with the leaders of the Intelligence Committee. They don’t have it. So if there’s some lower-level people at [Office of the Director of National Intelligence] that came in and gave this analysis to the House — look, I’d like to see it. But I haven’t seen it."
Later, just to make matters more difficult, there were leaks that Russia is also trying to help elect Bernie Sanders. The leak left many experts baffled — except to the extent that, with the Trump leak, it seemed to target the intelligence community’s two least-favorite candidates.
There were lots of reports that President Trump was angry after the news broke. And why shouldn’t he be angry? Way back in January 2017, when Trump was president-elect and protesting that the intelligence community was out to get him, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer famously said, "You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you."
The years that followed proved that to be true. And it still is.

Texto completo: ABC News reporter suspended: ABC News suspended one of its veteran correspondents late Tuesday for unguarded remarks he made in a video by operatives of Project Veritas, the conservative group that records "undercover" footage of mainstream journalists to bolster its accusations of media bias. The network disciplined David Wright, 56, one of ABC’s most seasoned correspondents, having joined the network nearly 20 years ago.
Clyburn endorses Biden: NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking black member of Congress and the kingmaker of South Carolina’s Democratic political orbit, on Wednesday endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.
School bus driver gets 10 years: MORRISTOWN, N.J. — Hudy Muldrow, 79, the driver of a school bus that veered across Interstate 80 in New Jersey after he missed an exit and crashed into a dump truck, killing a teacher and a student and injuring dozens of others, was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison.
Colorado rejects death penalty: DENVER — Colorado is set to become the 22nd U.S. state to abolish the death penalty after lawmakers on Wednesday approved a repeal bill that Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has pledged to sign into law.
Spain cancels Domingo event: MADRID — The Spanish government canceled upcoming performances by PlÃ¡cido Domingo in Madrid on Wednesday following the singer’s acceptance of "full responsibility" for actions that prompted sexual misconduct allegations, as cracks formed in the steadfast support European opera houses have shown for the tenor.
Delhi riots claim 24: NEW DELHI — At least 24 people were killed and 189 injured in three days of clashes in New Delhi that coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's first state visit to India, with the death toll expected to rise as hospitals continue to take in the wounded, authorities said Wednesday.
Lynching soon a federal crime: WASHINGTON — Sixty-five years after 14-year-old Emmett Till was lynched in Mississippi, the House has approved legislation designating lynching as a hate crime under federal law. The bill, introduced by Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush and named after Till, comes 120 years after Congress first considered anti-lynching legislation and after dozens of similar efforts were defeated. The measure was approved 410 to 4 on Wednesday. The Senate unanimously passed virtually identical legislation last year. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill.
Trump sues New York Times: President Donald Trump escalated his war on the press by suing New York Times Co. over an opinion piece that said his 2016 election campaign agreed to exchange positive foreign policy on Russia for help in defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton. The Times published a false and defamatory piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s oligarchy to swap assistance in the race against Clinton for relief from economic sanctions imposed by Barack Obama's administration, according to the lawsuit.

Fact-checking the Democratic presidential debate

Texto completo: Here is a collection of fact-checks from the 10th Democratic presidential debate, this time in South Carolina.
“You didn’t write that bill. I wrote that bill. … We’ll have a fact-check look at this.” — Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.
“I wrote the bill, the Violence Against Women Act. … Let’s look at the fact-check.” — former Vice President Joe Biden
Our verdict? Klobuchar and Biden were talking past each other and about different bills they wrote to protect women against violent crime.
Klobuchar said she authored a bill “to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can’t go out and get an AK-47.”
Biden interjected, “I wrote that law.” Klobuchar dismissed him, saying she was the one who wrote it. But Biden said that he wrote the Violence Against Women Act, that the “boyfriend loophole” was not covered, and that Klobuchar was working on that: “I couldn’t get that covered. You in fact as a senator tried to get it covered and Mitch McConnell is holding it up on his desk right now.”
Klobuchar in January 2019 introduced a bill “to protect victims of stalking from gun violence.” In a news release, Klobuchar said her proposal would help close what’s known as the “boyfriend loophole” and prevent people who have abused dating partners from buying or owning firearms.
For his part, Biden championed the Violence Against Women Act as a Democratic senator from Delaware in 1994. The act increased funding and provided additional legal tools for combating violent crimes committed against women.
“The president fired the pandemic specialists in this country two years ago.” — former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg
It’s true that in May 2018, the top White House official who was in charge of the U.S. response to pandemics left the administration.
Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer was the senior director of global health and biodefense on the National Security Council and oversaw global health security issues. That global health team was disbanded after Ziemer’s departure and reorganized as part of a streamlining effort headed by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton. Ziemer’s position on the NSC has not been filled in the last two years.
“Sen. Sanders at one point said it was going to be $40 trillion, then 30, then 17. It’s an incredible shrinking price tag. At some point he said it is unknowable to see what the price tag will be.” — former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Sanders has cited differing estimates of what Medicare for All would cost.
The $30 trillion to $40 trillion figure alludes to work done by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. It is the only analysis to factor in the price of long-term care — one of the most expensive components of the Medicare for All plan — and finds the program would cost $34 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years. (In terms of national health spending, it would result in an increase of $7 trillion over a decade.) The research makes assumptions that Sanders’ bill leaves open-ended, such as estimating what Medicare for All would ultimately pay hospitals and health professionals.
The $17 trillion comes from newer research: a paper released Feb. 15 in the medical journal The Lancet. The researchers say Medicare for All would save $450 billion annually. That would bump down the cost significantly, to just about $17 trillion over 10 years. This figure is what Sanders relies on in calculating his own plan to finance the single-payer plan. His proposed set of revenues would raise about $17.14 trillion in a decade.
Mike Bloomberg in 2016 “dumped $12 million in the Pennsylvania Senate race to help re-elect an anti-choice right-wing Republican senator.” — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
Warren is correct that Bloomberg financially supported some Republicans for the U.S. Senate, including Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa, who opposes abortion rights.
A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg’s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans.
We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomey’s campaign.

FBI says neo-Nazis harassed journalists, Cabinet official

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, a university and a church.
The charges, announced Wednesday in Virginia and Washington state, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group.
In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as "swatting" - calling police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing authorities to respond in force.
In one instance, prosecutors said, Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen.
In other cases in 2018 and 2019, prosecutors said, Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University, Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and an unnamed Cabinet official who authorities said was under Secret Service protection. Last month, prosecutors said, Denton met with an undercover FBI agent and described his efforts.
"Denton said that if he was 'raided' for swatting ProPublica, then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime," Jonathan Myles Lund, an FBI agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Denton and others.
Authorities said Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University.
In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen's chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington, described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Florida; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Arizona.
Authorities said the quartet devised an operation called Erste Saule, or "first pillar" in German, which Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target "journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message."
The goal, Shea said, was to "erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act."
Prosecutors said Cole and Shea were the "primary organizers." When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Shea and Cole offered praise. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel "terrorized." Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges.
Authorities said Cole and Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets.
Raymond Duda, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Seattle, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement's radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and "hate camps." He said the FBI was continuing to investigate the group around the country.

Texto completo: Maria Sharapova announced her retirement from tennis on Wednesday morning. The 32-year-old Russian completed her career Grand Slam in 2012 with a French Open title. She won five Grand Slams between 2004 and 2014 - two at the French and one each at the U.S. Open, Australian Open and Wimbledon.
Sharapova wrote about quitting tennis in a Vanity Fair essay. She described a shredded right shoulder as a major factor in her decision. "Over time my tendons have frayed like a string ... My body had become a distraction."
She also cited the death of Kobe Bryant as a reason for her somewhat abrupt retirement. "We were supposed to see each other like three days after the crash," she told the New York Times in an interview Wednesday.
"I think we all seem at times in our journey like larger than life because of what we do, but everyone at the core is incredibly fragile," she said. "And if anything it just opens up your eyes to what really matters in life, so that was a moment where I had a really good think about my future as well."
Sharapova's five Grand Slams tie her for No. 21 all-time. Her career was partly defined by a series of real and ginned-up controversies, like her "rivalry" with Serena Williams. She beat Williams in their first-ever matchup, the 2004 Wimbledon final. (Sharapova was 17 years old.) Williams said that she played at "20%" of what she was capable of, and it was true: Williams would go 20-1 against Sharapova over the rest of her career.
Williams talked trash about Sharapova's game and personal life; Sharapova returned it. After Williams said "if she wants to be with the guy with a black heart, go for it," Sharapova said "If she wants to talk about something personal, maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married."
Sharapova then wrote in her memoir that she heard second-hand that Williams had said "I'll never lose to that little bitch again" after Wimbledon.
Some of Sharapova's controversies were self-generated. Others were less fair, like her 2016 doping ban. After that year's Australian Open - where she lost to Williams in the quarterfinals - she tested positive for meldonium, a drug that became illegal less than a month before her positive test. After initially giving her a two-year suspension, anti-doping authorities reduced her suspension to 15 months.
Sharapova struggled after returning in 2017. Her only major quarterfinal between then and retirement came at the 2018 French Open. She was set to play Serena Williams in the fourth round, but Williams pulled out with an injury.
Sharapova was a child prodigy. The 32-year-old repeatedly referred to her "28-year" career in her retirement essay, meaning she marks the beginning of her career when she was three or four years old. She moved to the United States at six, then enrolled at Nick Bollettieri's tennis academy at nine.

Hungry for intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: Zoe Kravitz is in the process of curating a pretty dope playlist.
After a few catchy early numbers and some recent jams like "Big Little Lies," the actor, singer, model and now producer is pumping up the volume on her career with new Hulu series "High Fidelity" and, of course, Matt Reeves' "The Batman," in which she co-stars as Catwoman.
Variety caught up with Kravitz, 31, to talk romantic comedies, playing opposite Robert Pattinson and those "Big Little Lies" behind-the-scenes issues.

Q: Your character in "High Fidelity" is someone who lives and breathes music. Is that something you relate to?
A: Her inability to fully see herself is something I've experienced, something I've gone through. Someone who's able to understand something like music so deeply and then struggle to understand how a relationship works is really interesting to me. I've had those moments in my life where I felt like I understand art and music really well, I can talk about that, I can do that - but love is more complicated.

Q: What romantic comedies, other than the original "High Fidelity," were you looking to for inspiration?
A: "Sex and the City" was a major influence for me. There was a certain element of comedy and true drama and authenticity, wit and fearlessness that always attracted me, and it's also just such a New York show; for someone who lives there, they did it correctly. I've always been drawn to the kinds of stories that revolve around people stuck in a place and the things they talk about, because it felt like what I do with my friends. You sit around, you smoke weed, you talk about movies, you argue about characters and actors and music. That's some of my favorite (stuff) to do. When it's written well, when it feels real, it's so fun to see.

Q: Talk to me about the regular fourth-wall breaks; what do they illuminate about your character?
A: When you do those, you have to break a habit, because your whole career you're told to not look at the camera, not acknowledge it, so I had to allow myself to have a new relationship with the camera, to think of it as my friend. It's good to imagine a person there, you're talking to your friend because it can feel stiff and performative otherwise, because that device lets the audience into the character, especially because Rob is so guarded, it's important that she's able to feel vulnerable in those moments. I would literally picture a friend of mine in front of the camera and say I'm talking to a person right now.

Q: Those coupled with the subject matter feel very reminiscent of "Fleabag."
A: I actually didn't watch "Fleabag" on purpose ... because when we were writing it and people learned I was talking to camera, the first thing they would say is "Fleabag!" I felt like if I saw the show I would either imitate, or be intimated by, or compare myself to Phoebe's performance. I did not watch the show until after, and then of course I loved it and thought it was ... perfect.

Q: Switching focus to "The Batman," DC films come with their own unique brand of pressure. Is that something you're nervous about?
A: Definitely, I was excited when I got the role, and usually when you get a job, the people who are excited about it are you, your parents, your agent, your friends and that's kind of it. But when the press release came, I got more text messages and calls than I've gotten on my birthday, on my wedding day. All of a sudden, the reality began to sink in about what this means not only to me but to everybody else culturally - and the fans of this universe are so dedicated and opinionated.

Q: You could certainly say that.
A: It was a little scary, but also whenever I get nervous about something, I feel it pushes me to a better place, so I welcome the nerves. If you start focusing too much on what people are going to think you're doing yourself a disservice. Of course, I want to honor the fans and hope they like what I do with the role, but in order to do what I think I need to do with Catwoman, I have to go internal and forget about the rest of the world.

Q: How do you feel about Robert Pattinson as Batman? What has it been like working with him so far?
A: I've never worked with him before, but we've been together for the last few weeks ... training together and rehearsing together, and he's just a delightful person and such a wonderful, thoughtful actor. I think he's perfect for the role, and it's going to be such an adventure. I'm excited to have him as my partner in crime and to be there to support each other, because it's intense. It's going to be a long shoot and there's a lot of pressure, and I know he has my back and I have his.

Q: Nicole Kidman said she would be open to doing another season of "Big Little Lies," but she pointed to your busy schedule to say that a potential Season 3 won't be here for some time.
A: Mine?! How about Meryl or Reese or Shailene? For wonderful reasons everyone's busy, but I think we would all make time to make another season happen. It really feels like priority No. 1 for a lot of us, because we love each other, and we love the story and we love culturally what it means to people. I feel like all of us would clear whatever we could to make that happen. But don't try and throw me under the bus, Nicole!

Q: Did you feel like Season 2 provided a satisfying ending to Bonnie's story?
A: I don't know if it felt like an ending, but it felt like there was a breakthrough, especially coming from Season 1 where she's seen as this picture-perfect, very Zen person. It was nice to break that all down this season. It's almost like we met Bonnie for the first time by the end of Season 2. It's always a delight to get the opportunity to go deeper into a character, because you don't always get a chance to do that.
Caption: Zoe Kravitz says "Sex and the City" was a big inspiration for her latest role in Hulu's "High Fidelity." "It's such a New York show," she said.

Texto completo: Q: In the early '60s there was a comic book called "Katy Keene." Is that where the TV show got started?
A: The CW series is a spinoff of "Riverdale," which reimagines Archie Comics characters. And "Katy Keene," according to the network, "follows the lives and loves of four iconic Archie Comics characters - fashion legend-to-be Katy Keene (Lucy Hale), singer/songwriter Josie McCoy (Ashleigh Murray), performer Jorge Lopez/Ginger (Jonny Beauchamp), and "It Girl" Pepper Smith (Julia Chan) - as they chase their 20-something dreams in New York City together."
The comic book Keene, which was introduced in 1945, has also been seen as an inspiration for fashion choices by singer Katy Perry. BuzzFeed offered a detailed comparison of images of the two Katys in 2014, but Perry told Rolling Stone that any suggestion she had copied the comic was "crazy."

Q: Could you let me know what happened to Harve Presnell, who was in the movie "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" with Debbie Reynolds? He has this great voice but I cannot find any other movies that he made.
A: As his entry on the Internet Movie Database makes clear, Presnell worked often. Stage credits include Broadway versions of "Molly Brown" and "Annie." He sang in the movie "Paint Your Wagon," with the Los Angeles Times, saying that "his rendition of 'They Call the Wind Mariah' was singled out by critics as the lone highlight in an otherwise disastrous film." Another memorable screen appearance was as Wade Gustafson, the father-in-law of William H. Macy's character in "Fargo." And on TV he was in "Dawson's Creek," "The Pretender" and other shows. He was 75 when he died of pancreatic cancer in 2009.

Q: This might be before your time, but what happened to the show "Adventures in Paradise"? The actor was named Adam Troy, I think.
A: Adam Troy was the character played by Gardner McKay (1932-2001) on the drama, which first aired on ABC for three seasons in 1959-62. McKay's character was "the captain of a freelance schooner plying the South Pacific in search of passengers, cargo and adventure," according to "The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows." James A. Michener created the series.
One article noted that McKay became a "TV heartthrob" through the show, but he did not long for that sort of celebrity. As The New York Times said in McKay's obituary, he basically abandoned acting after "Paradise" ended to focus on travel and writing, the latter including plays and novels.

Q: I love the show "Pitbulls and Parolees," but there used to be another show about saving pit bulls. The man who saved them was a little person who had been in prison at one time. It hasn't been on for a long time so it probably won't be returning, but I would love to know what he is doing.
A: The show you remember is "Pit Boss," which aired on Animal Planet from 2010 to 2013. Its star, Shorty Rossi, has several enterprises; you can find out more at shortywood.com.

Texto completo: Growing up in California, Orion Tait used to watch his father's weekend housekeeping routine.
"Sunday was loud music -- Neil Young -- and my dad going around watering the plants," Tait recalled. "He had a deck of plants growing everywhere. It was a ritual."
Tait, a creative director and partner at Buck, a production company, tried to carry on that tradition as an adult in his Brooklyn home, complete with the loud rock. But he and his wife, Amy Won, were too busy to care for their houseplants. They never got around to repotting them. Fungus gnats colonized.
"I was, like, this is New York City," Tait said. "There's got to be someone we can hire."
That someone was Lisa Muñoz. For $2,000, Muñoz will come fill your house with plants and make it look beautiful. You can spend more than $2,000, but you cannot spend less; that's the minimum fee charged by her Brooklyn-based firm, Leaf and June.
That covers the design, plants, potting, delivery of plants and a detailed care guide, Muñoz said. "You don't have to call an Uber XL to transport your big tree home," she said. "We do all the dirty work for you."
If Muñoz, 38, sounds practiced at selling her services, it's because her job title -- interior plant designer -- usually requires explanation. It's an emerging career; she has been doing it for six years.
Nurseries and flower shops have long provided professional plant care for offices and homes. Muñoz offers such maintenance services to her clients too.
But her real role is in performing the job that a fashion stylist or art consultant might -- to make aesthetic choices and sound investments on someone's behalf. Just ... about plants.
The fascination with houseplants has begun to spawn all manner of specialists.
After he began posting photos of his Baltimore home to Instagram three years ago, and talking about the 200 plants that fill the lush rooms, Hilton Carter became a bit of a celebrity. He published a book, "Wild at Home: How to Style and Care for Beautiful Plants," and, he says, created a new occupation.
"I'm not going to lie to you -- I believe I was the first person to ever say I was a plant stylist," said Carter, 40, who worked at an ad agency before dedicating himself to houseplants. "I just ran with it. That's awesome that it's now a job title."
These days, Carter is too busy with his other plant gigs (he has a new book coming out this spring, "Wild Interiors," with a promotional tour to follow) to do much styling, he said.
Maryah Greene, who runs the one-woman firm Greene Piece, bills herself as New York City's "Plant Doctor & Stylist." She is the fiddle-leaf-fig whisperer for the rest of us: She charges a flat hourly rate of between $125 and $175. Her clients are largely renters who want to introduce a little greenery into their lives but don't know a pothos plant from a bird of paradise, much less how to not kill them.
"A lot of what I do I like to think of as confidence boosting," said Greene, 24, who has plant-styled for more than a year and has met with about 50 clients so far.
The confidence they crave requires counsel: Will a monstera be happy by the radiator? Can sunshine-loving cactuses thrive in a light-starved apartment? What's the best pot to show off the pink and white leaves of hoya carnosa?

More plant money, more plant problems
One wonders why a plant stylist is needed in the first place. The library is still free.
Yet in the age of the gig economy, where freelancers and consultants exist to fulfill every life need, and hiring out a task can be preferable to learning how to do it yourself, houseplant decisions are just another thing to outsource.
The plant stylists say most people's ability to properly choose and care for houseplants is woeful, even as the reported desire to live among them is high.
"One of the biggest questions I get from clients is, 'What plant can I get that would be good with no light?' " Muñoz said. "No light? That's actually not possible."
John Fraser, a chef, hired Muñoz to rescue his neglected houseplants, which "were on death's door," and to create a potted greenscape on the balcony of his apartment. "I wanted someone who could give me the answers that you probably learn over time," he said. "Because of travel and restaurant stuff, I'm not the best caretaker."
Meeting with a plant stylist is "a really intimate service," Greene said, and thus caters to the still would-be plant parent. "I can't provide you with the right plants unless I know who you are, what your work schedule is like, your history with plants."

No doctorate required
A four-year degree in horticulture or botany isn't necessary to style plants. Greene was earning her master's in education and literacy and hanging around plant shops when she realized she could make money from her hobby.
In 2013, Muñoz earned her certificate in horticulture from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and began working part time at plant shops to further educate herself. Her business was born in 2014.
Muñoz recently installed 115 potted plants in Buck's large, light-filled offices overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront, at the behest of Tait and his partners. Soon after, she said, the company asked for a proposal to add more plants.
"I think people are really just wanting things that make them happy. And things that are alive ...," Muñoz said, trailing off.
She considered her curious role. "I mean, have you ever heard of plants making people mad?"

Texto completo: It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum -- in the mid-six figures, Reindl said -- to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment -- say, eight months -- can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."

A fiery speech sparks riots in one Indian neighborhood

Texto completo: To many in the eastern Delhi neighborhood where a convulsion of religious violence erupted this week, it all began with one man.
Kapil Mishra, a local politician with India's leading Hindu nationalist party, had just lost an election. Acquaintances in the area, which now feels like a war zone, said he had been looking for a way to bounce back.
Mishra, 39, is known for his outspoken views and flexible politics. As an upper caste Hindu from a political family, he had worked for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and risen in the ranks of one of India's most progressive political organizations.
But several years ago he shifted allegiance across the political spectrum to the Bharatiya Janata Party, India's current governing party, which has deep roots in Hindu supremacist ideology.
On Sunday, he appeared at a rally against a group of protesters (most of them women) who were objecting to a new citizenship law widely seen as discriminatory toward Muslims. There he vented his anger in a fiery speech in which he issued an ultimatum to police: Either clear out the demonstrators, who were blocking a main road, or he and his followers would do it themselves.
Within hours, the worst Hindu-Muslim violence in India in years was exploding. Gangs of Hindus and Muslims fought each other with swords and bats, shops burst into flames, chunks of bricks sailed through the air, and mobs rained blows on cornered men.
"Kapil Mishra should be in jail," said Rupesh Bathla, a businessman who says he has known Mishra since they were teenagers. "He started communal riots. He planted hatred in other people's hearts."
By Wednesday, at least 24 people had died, hospital officials said, most from gunshot wounds. Several witnesses said the live fire came from the direction of the police officers, and the dead included Hindus as well as Muslims.
Though property belonging to Hindus was burned, the destruction was much heavier on the Muslim side.
In Muslim areas, shop after shop was destroyed and entire markets were burned down. Dozens of Muslim residents have accused police officers of standing passively by while the destruction was underway.
With the violence cooling down for the moment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hosted President Donald Trump as the fighting raged, broke his silence Wednesday after Trump had departed, urging people in a Twitter post to "maintain peace and brotherhood at all times." He added: "Peace and harmony are central to our ethos."
But concerns lingered among many Indians, including Hindus, that Mishra and his Hindu nationalist supporters have weaponized a very dangerous mood.
Protests against the new citizenship law, which makes it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become full-fledged Indian citizens, have flared intermittently since December. But this past week was the first time the protests turned large numbers of Hindus and Muslims violently against one another.

Oh, she's such a cruel 'Old Gray Lady'; Trump campaign: Times defames us

Texto completo: President Trump's reelection campaign filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times on Wednesday, accusing the newspaper of intentionally publishing fake news about Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
The White House stepped up its longrunning battle with the media, stating in Manhattan Supreme Court that the so-called "paper of record" needed to be held accountable for "intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump's campaign."
At issue was a March 27, 2019, opinion piece in the Times relating to former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Moscow's campaign of creating propaganda on social media to boost Trump's 2016 candidacy against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The column, written by Max Frankel, a former Times executive editor, referenced a quid pro quo between Russia and the Trump campaign.
"There was no need for detailed electoral collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's oligarchy because they had an overarching deal: the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration's burdensome economic sanctions," Frankel wrote.
The Trump team, among the paper's toughest critics, said the column went too far.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign said in the complaint. "The Times' own previous reporting had confirmed the falsity of these statements. But the Times published these statements anyway, knowing them to be false, and knowing it would misinform and mislead its own readers, because of the Times' extreme bias against and animosity toward the campaign, and the Times' exuberance to improperly influence the presidential election in November 2020."
A Times spokeswoman said, "The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable.
"Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance. We look forward to vindicating that right in this case."

Biden's lie about Mandela and the dog that didn't bark

Texto completo: There was much angry barking directed at Bernie Sanders during the Democratic presidential debate. But the Bernie Bros shouldn't worry, because it still looks like their guy is on his way to securing the Democratic nomination.
That's not the only story from the debate in South Carolina. There is more to politics than the barking for TV. Listen for what you don't hear, think of what's being avoided, look for the negative space between the dancers. The silence that tells you the story.
Like that dog that didn't bark at Joe Biden over his lie about Nelson Mandela.
And the silence of conventional wisdom, as pundits decide which Democratic presidential candidate to deem a "moderate," as if any of them are moderates in a party leaning wildly to the left. Conservative radio host Dan Proft has zeroed in on this phenomenon on his national radio program. He likens it to the rivalry between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks in Russia early in the last century.
Proft has a dog named Hayek. And it also barks. But for now, let's deal with the silent dogs.
First, Biden. He may win in South Carolina, he may not. Either way his campaign is dying. He's a bad candidate, a serial fabulist undone by his Ukrainian exploits, and like some drunk at the end of the bar at 4 a.m., Biden is always the hero of his own epic tale.
But the death of the Biden campaign, and the desperate pandering lie that Biden has been telling African American voters about Nelson Mandela, is most instructive.
Pandering to black voters is what white Democrats do for a living. The party has been completely consumed by identity and grievance politics. Without black votes, there is no Democratic Party. And such pandering is evidence that white Democrats who play the game hold their most loyal, core constituency in contempt.
Biden's lie about Mandela was wrapped in silence on that debate stage. It wasn't mentioned by his rivals and was studiously avoided by the hapless CBS debate moderators who lost control. No one thought to bring it up as a question, though the Biden lie had been exposed by The New York Times and other news organizations.
Biden told it repeatedly in South Carolina as black voters breached his so-called firewall and began warming to Bernie Sanders.
"This day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid," Biden told voters in Columbia, South Carolina, on Feb. 11, in a story about his time as the Democratic senator from Delaware. "I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on (Robben) Island."
With Sanders reaching black voters, Biden retold his lie about Mandela at a black history awards brunch in Las Vegas, and even added some Bidenesque embellishments.
"He threw his arms around me and said, 'I want to say thank you,'" Biden told supporters. "I said, 'What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?' He said: 'You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.' "
Mandela, the liberating force who ended South African apartheid, was that country's first black president and died in 2013.
Andrew Young was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and traveled with Biden to South Africa. He scoffed at the notion that members of Congress had been arrested.
"No, I was never arrested, and I don't think he was, either," Young was quoted by the Times as saying.
That's polite political speech for "Joe is a big fat liar pandering for black votes."
Media clearly likes Biden. Until a few months ago, he was the Democratic Party establishment hope for defeating President Donald Trump. Then Nancy Pelosi's ill-advised Trump Impeachment Theater backfired, exposing Biden and his son Hunter's lucrative dealings with a politically connected natural gas company in Ukraine.
Now the Biden campaign is sheepishly walking back Joe's story about his arrest in South Africa. What would Biden call himself -- a "lying dog-faced pony soldier"?
And what of that other silent dog at the debate?
The common media wisdom, expressed by the silky Mayor Pete Buttigieg, was that Sanders is too "radical" as compared with other Democratic candidates. Sanders deconstructed that as pure nonsense. Mayor Pete could see where it was going and began babbling, trying to talk over the older man. Sanders wouldn't back down.
"Let us be clear," Sanders said. "Do we think that health care for all, Pete, is some kind of radical communist idea? Do we think raising the minimum wage to a living wage, do we think building millions of units of affordable housing, do we think raising taxes on billionaires is a radical idea? Do we think criminal justice reform is a radical idea? Do we think immigration reform is a radical idea? Truth is, Pete, the American people support my agenda, that is why I am beating Trump in virtually every poll and that is why I will win."
Do Democrats running for president oppose those ideas? No.
That's why Proft and other conservative intellectuals have discussed this "moderate" Democrat business in the context of the Russian Bolsheviks and their rivals, the Mensheviks.
They were both going in the same direction, but the Mensheviks were timid and wanted to go at a slower pace. The Bolsheviks thought them weaklings and wanted to get there in a hurry. And so does Bernie.
This is shaping up to be a fantastic campaign, just as long as the dogs bark, occasionally.

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, "they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump reelected." The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump's reelection. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Trump? That would be the self-described democratic socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) The New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it's out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian "collusion" narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how it supposedly intends to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Putin's press secretary told Russian state-run media, "This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth."
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year's election should Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach not only his 2016 election but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy.
That's why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn't recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America's "faults" have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush's administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the deaths of many in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like a setup and an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup Poll shows record high approval (49%) of the president's policies. Meanwhile, 43% of independents polled now support the president -- the highest percentage during Trump's entire presidency. We'll see if that translates into Republican victories in races for the Senate and House.
According to Gallup, "The latest survey finds a further increase in national satisfaction, with 45% now satisfied, the highest since February 2005."
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall "The Gingrich who stole Christmas" line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s. Democrats have also demagogued Republicans for not helping the poor and for being racist. That is a harder sell with the African American unemployment rate at record lows and wages rising for virtually all groups. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty level is as low as it's been in 11 years.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

FBI says neo-Nazis harassed journalists, Cabinet official

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, a university and a church.
The charges, announced Wednesday in Virginia and Washington state, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group.
In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as "swatting" -- calling police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing authorities to respond in force.
In one instance, prosecutors said, Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen.
In other cases in 2018 and 2019, prosecutors said, Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University, Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and an unnamed Cabinet official who authorities said was under Secret Service protection. Last month, prosecutors said, Denton met with an undercover FBI agent and described his efforts.
"Denton said that if he was 'raided' for swatting ProPublica, then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime," Jonathan Myles Lund, an FBI agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Denton and others.
Authorities said Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University.
In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen's chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington, described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Florida; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Arizona.
Authorities said the quartet devised an operation called Erste Saule, or "first pillar" in German, which Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target "journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message."
The goal, Shea said, was to "erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act."
Prosecutors said Cole and Shea were the "primary organizers." When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Shea and Cole offered praise. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel "terrorized." Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges.
Authorities said Cole and Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets.
Raymond Duda, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Seattle, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement's radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and "hate camps." He said the FBI was continuing to investigate the group around the country.

Texto completo: Trial begins in Italy for jailed American pals in cop's slaying
ROME -- Two former schoolmates from California sat impassively in a courtroom Wednesday for the start of their trial for the murder of a plainclothes Italian policeman while they were vacationing in Rome last summer.
In pretrial court documents, prosecutors alleged that Finnegan Lee Elder, now 20, thrust a7-inch knife repeatedly into Carabiniere Vice Brigadier Mario Cerciello, while his friend, Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, now 19, scuffled with the officer's partner.
The jailed defendants have contended they didn't realize the officers were plainclothes police but mistook them for criminals following a thwarted cocaine sale hours earlier in a Rome nightlife district.
Just a row behind them was the widow of Cerciello, who was killed only days after he returned to duty from his honeymoon.
Elder, according to pretrial documents, admitted to the stabbing but said he acted in self-defense when he feared the burly Cerciello was strangling him.
Natale-Hjorth has also told authorities he acted in self-defense, alleging that he and his friend were assaulted by the police officers, so he scuffled with Cerciello's partner, Andrea Varriale. The partner suffered kicks and scratches, according to prosecutors.
According to judicial documents, Natale-Hjorth said he didn't know Elder had the knife. Prosecutors contend that after the stabbing, Natale-Hjorth hid the knife behind a ceiling panel in their hotel room.
Under Italian law, accomplices to an alleged murderer can also be charged with the murder itself. Italy's stiffest criminal punishment is life imprisonment.

Congress warns Pentagon not to shift funds for Trump wall
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers from both parties told Pentagon leaders on Wednesday that the Defense Department is undermining its own efforts to get military money by diverting billions of dollars for the construction of President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the committee's top Republican warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper that overturning congressional funding decisions will have consequences.
Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that Congress may place greater restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to shift money to meet military needs.
The chairman, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said: "The message it sends is the Pentagon has plenty of money," and "undercuts any arguments for any need for resources."

Trump campaign sues paper over 2019 opinion article
NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's reelection campaign sued The New York Times on Wednesday, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements claiming his 2016 election campaign had an agreement with Russia to exchange positive foreign policy for help defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton.
The suit, filed in New York State Court, alleges that The Times published a defamatory opinion piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign argues in the suit.
The Times published the piece because of its "extreme bias ... and animosity," the lawsuit said.

Spain cancels tenor Domingo's part in two opera dates in May
MADRID -- Spain's Culture Ministry said Wednesday it canceled tenor Placido Domingo's participation in Madrid's La Zarzuela light opera theater in May, a day after the legendary singer said he accepted "full responsibility" for his actions that led to accusations of sexual misconduct.
It is the first time a performance by Domingo has been canceled in Europe since allegations surfaced of sexual misconduct by the singer.
The Culture Ministry's decision came a day after the U.S. union representing opera performers said its investigators found the opera star and former general director at Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera had behaved inappropriately over the course of two decades when he held senior management positions at the companies.

Lawsuit: Miss. prison has 'abhorrent conditions'
JACKSON, Miss. -- The Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman is a violent, rat-infested place where inmates live in "abhorrent conditions" and their medical needs are routinely ignored, attorneys say in a new lawsuit filed on behalf of 152 prisoners
The suit was filed in federal court Tuesday, and attorneys are asking for class-action status to cover all current and future inmates at Parchman. It eventually could be merged with a similar lawsuit filed in January on behalf of 33 other Parchman inmates.
At least 19 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December, many from outbursts of violence at Parchman and other prisons.
The U.S. Justice Department announced on Feb. 5 that its civil rights division would investigate Parchman and other Mississippi prisons.

Court sides with Trump in sanctuary grant fight
NEW YORK -- The Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement grants to force states to cooperate with immigration enforcement, a federal appeals court in New York ruled Wednesday in a decision that conflicted with three other federal appeals courts.
The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned a lower court's decision ordering the administration to release funding to New York City and seven states -- New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island.
Federal appeals courts in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have ruled against the U.S. government by upholding lower-court injunctions placed on the enforcement of some or all of the challenged conditions.

In Wyoming: Sharpshooters in a helicopter killed 36 mountain goats in a contested effort to eradicate the nonnative animals from Grand Teton National Park.
Four days after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to stop the shooting on the day it began, park officials released the tally Tuesday.
About 100 mountain goats, descendants of animals introduced outside the park decades ago, inhabit the Teton Range. Using a combination of shooters in the air and eventually on the ground, park officials say they want to eradicate the goats because they compete with bighorn sheep for food and habitat and can spread diseases including pneumonia to the native animals.

Ex-White House doctor takes a shot at House seat

Texto completo: Dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, with an American flag pin on his lapel, Dr. Ronny Jackson rolled up at the Red River Harley-Davidson outpost to make his pitch to voters.
"I just came from the White House," Jackson, the former White House physician, told the small crowd gathered upstairs from the Harley showroom. "I've been working side by side with the president. I know all the Cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser. I can pick the phone up and I can call them. They're all friends of mine."
Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from President Donald Trump's physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct.
Now he's running for Congress in Texas' 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple. In a primary field of 15 anti-immigrant, anti-abortion Republicans, Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election.
Standing alongside other candidates wearing cowboy hats and "Make America Great Again" caps at the forum Feb. 20, Jackson pitched himself as the only one "who can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, 'Sir, I need you to stop what you're doing and listen to me,' and he will stop what he's doing and listen to me."
That access, he said, would make him a powerful replacement for Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican who announced last fall he would not seek reelection after representing his district for more than a quarter of a century.
But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate. There have been more than a few.
His campaign organization, for one thing.
Jackson's campaign manager, he said, is "a horse doctor" with a full-time job. He has one full-time staff member, a recent college graduate who is also working for free, and he has relied on his wife, Jane, to drive him around the Panhandle-encompassing district, which spans 41 counties. And despite having a power Rolodex, he has never reached into it to ask the right people for help.
Trump, who now generally adheres to rules put in place by his political shop about whom he endorses and what races he weighs in on, has been silent about Jackson's campaign.
Jackson is now facing an uphill battle against two well-funded and connected opponents -- Chris Ekstrom, a Dallas millionaire who recently moved to the district to run and is self-funding his campaign, and Josh Winegarner, a lobbyist who has the backing of the cattle industry he represents and Thornberry.
But Jackson's connections to the Trump administration as well as the president and his family are real, even if they have not translated into much support.
Eric Trump has tweeted a supportive message, and Trump has privately encouraged Jackson to run. And Jackson is benefiting, if belatedly, from Trump allies and aides who have only recently realized he needed help and have pitched in, setting him up with a real online fundraising and phone prospecting operation, which helped to finally get him on air with a commercial -- a 30-second spot made up entirely of old clips of Trump praising his character.
Jackson, 52, who served in the White House medical unit under the past three presidents, grew close to Trump after delivering the results of a presidential physical in a briefing at which he promoted Trump's "incredible genes," said he did "exceedingly well" on a cognitive test and claimed that if he had adhered to a better diet over the past 20 years, he could have lived to be 200.
"That was the day I got the Trump stamp on me completely," Jackson said. . "I was no longer viewed as a nonpartisan physician on military orders, even though I still technically was. What I didn't realize was that it made people much more aggressive toward me when the VA nomination came up."
At the time of the allegations against him -- which included loosely dispensing strong drugs to lawmakers and political aides -- Jackson was not allowed to respond because he was an active-duty military officer.
Jackson called the allegations against him "complete garbage."
But for Jackson, the question will be whether the last-ditch help from Trump world has come too late -- by Friday, more than half of the vote will already be in because of early voting in the March 3 primary.

Texto completo: The Democratic primary battle between Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg could be easily resolved if they would realize how much they have in common. In fact, they would make a great ticket. Imagine the slogan: "Sanders-Bloomberg: Because you're tired of running your own life."
Being a moderate libertarian -- or a libertarian moderate, I'm not quite sure -- I'm partial to those passages in the Constitution that say, "Congress shall make no law." I have a high regard for both free markets and civil liberties; for both abortion rights and gun rights; for a humane safety net and fiscal prudence. The best government is one that performs only clearly essential functions but performs those well -- while recognizing its limits not only at home but also abroad.
Anyone of this general cast of mind, of course, can no more tolerate Donald Trump than a lamb could lie down with a Tyrannosaurus rex. It's hard to remember a president so contemptuous of such a wide range of liberties.
Freedom of speech? He wanted NFL players banished for kneeling during the national anthem. Freedom of the press? He regards the media as "the enemy of the people." Freedom from unreasonable search and seizure? Trump pulled back federal efforts to curb police abuses. Reproductive rights? Since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, they have never been at greater risk.
He doesn't like laissez-faire capitalism, as evidenced by his hostility to international trade, his bullying of corporations that don't obey his commands and his bailouts of farmers. He has installed a legion of knaves, hacks and toadies to mishandle the indispensable tasks of the federal government -- such as fighting global pandemics or protecting the environment. His fiscal record is a fright.
Either Sanders or Bloomberg would be an improvement, in the same way that it would be better to be trampled by beagles than by buffaloes. But each of these Democrats has plenty of debits on his record. Neither has much commitment to individual freedom as a matter of principle.
Sanders has only contempt for people who gain great wealth by creating something that people want. He wants to punish them even if they have made our lives better.
It's unfair to suggest that his policies would resemble communism. But his defense of Marxist regimes suggests a willingness to excuse harsh methods to advance what he sees as worthy purposes.
Sanders' proposal for national rent control combines economic illiteracy with gross federal overreach. He believes in "Medicare for All" -- and he does mean all, including those who would rather keep their private health insurance. It's hard to escape the suspicion that in Sanders' mind, the compulsory nature of his plan is not a necessary evil but a supreme virtue.
Then there's the matter of paying for it. As The New York Times noted, he "estimated Sunday night on '60 Minutes' that the price tag for his 'Medicare for All' plan would be about $30 trillion over 10 years, but the revenue he identifies for it in the new outline totals about $17.5 trillion."
Bloomberg is overbearing and intrusive in his own way. As New York City mayor, he barred many businesses from selling sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces on "public health" grounds -- though a court overruled him. He waged war on flavored tobacco products and trans fats and required chain restaurants to post calorie counts.
He even deployed full-court pressure tactics to get new mothers to breastfeed, regardless of their needs or desires. The presumption of personal autonomy never found a place in Bloomberg's heart.
His faith in coercion helps account for his support of stop-and-frisk tactics by New York police, which put a target on the backs of young Hispanic and African American men, the vast majority of them innocent. Under Bloomberg, the number of such encounters soared.Though he now claims credit for reducing them, the reality is that a federal judge ruled the practice unconstitutional.
When that decision came down, Bloomberg raised fears of "a lot of people dying." In fact, crime declined after stop-and-frisk was drastically curtailed. Bloomberg put his instincts above the liberties of New Yorkers, and his instincts proved wrong.
What he and Sanders share is an eagerness to override individual freedom whenever it hinders their plans, and an impatience with limits on government authority. Their grand schemes are not as toxic or alarming as Trump's. But under any of these three, the right to be left alone would be left in the lurch.

Market panic means little for some

Texto completo: Monday's 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America's real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors. Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what's happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market," says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. "But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education."
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 an hour, picking up trash from fans who may pay hundreds to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single mothers in the United States, 29% live in poverty. Most do not have college educations and could not afford one even if they wanted a four-year degree.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with high deductibles and co-pays.
Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, the stock market decline means a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can't afford to rent a small apartment.
The Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on the Chinese economy – and potential impact on the global economy – are cited as the major reasons for Monday's stock market sell-off. However, it is poor, low-wage and even many middle-class Americans who are more likely to be in poor health and have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those who have higher incomes and are well educated. The richest American men live 15 years longer than the poorest.
A huge collapse in the stock market makes little difference to them. How could it, if one is behind on one's bills, has a broken-down car, needs food stamps to eat and Medicaid to get health care.
Conversely, a 1,000-point drop in the Dow Jones is not going to stop the wealthiest Americans from buying homes around the world and a yacht or private jet where they can drink Dom Perignon.
If those at the top bewail the millions in stock-market investments wiped out Monday, remember: 2 out of 5 households do not have enough savings to make ends meet for three months at the poverty level.
Let's make the distinction: Monday was an awful day for investors, but too many Americans don't have the savings to participate in the stock market. For them, a trillion dollar economic calamity means little.

Texto completo: As longtime residents of Granville, we are happy with the leadership of our village and its current policies towards development. Our small town, with its close family life, churches, friends, and schools, is welcome compared to the hectic lifestyle, heavy traffic conditions, and high density housing that comes with significant commercial development.
Larger towns and cities are within driving distance for those who miss commercialization and heavy traffic.
Adam Weinberg stated that "we seem to be really good in Granville in articulating what we don't want, in stopping things from happening. We're not sure what we do want." Many of us do know what we want and it is what we have now.
Adam Weinberg also stated that "entrepreneurs, developers and restaurateurs, many of whom have moved here, have cool things they want to do here, but our reputation is not good."
Granville has received much positive recognition by various independent sources:
Rated in the top 10 best villages in Ohio.
Recognized as one of the best place to live in America.
One of Ohio's best small towns for tourists.
One of the best hometowns in Ohio
One of the most beautiful towns in Ohio
Zippia recently stated that Granville is the "smartest" city in Ohio. Perhaps, our mayor and village council know best.

Climate activists must practice what they preach While I undoubtedly feel for Shivaune Field's country of Australia during these terrible fires, I have a hard time accepting a "climate crisis" as fact from a PHD Student in Global Leadership and Change...
I wish it wasn't so, but her political biases (liberal/left) makes me question the 'facts' she disseminates to us. This would be true if she was a supporter of conservatives/right as well.
I believe we can truly come together on reducing our environmental impact, but first, she and the national media needs to start acknowledging and holding accountable the hypocritical actions of the people leading this environmental charge.
Case in point, former president Barack Obama lectured Americans that we couldn't keep our thermostat on 72 degrees or buy SUV's anymore, he claimed the science is clear on global warming.
He then proceeds to buy a $15 million, 7000 Sq. foot home on 29 acres in Martha's Vineyard, on the coastline of the Atlantic Ocean. This island is only accessible by water or air, and is just that, an island, where the science "clearly" indicates that sea levels are supposed to rise... crickets from the New York Times or his environmental friends.
Call me cynical, but if your fearless leaders don't practice what they preach, you will have a hard time convincing other people of the dire emergency we are all in, regardless if you have the credible science to back it up.

Endorsements by newspapers still have purpose

Texto completo: Do political endorsements by newspapers have much impact?
It was debatable even back in the 1980s, when daily circulation stood at about 63 million nationwide, and it's even more uncertain now that the number has dropped by more than half. But while some people study polls, I watch editorial pages for insight about this vexing Democratic presidential race.
Pete Buttigieg had not received a single endorsement from a daily newspaper until he picked up backing of the San Diego Union-Tribune and then, just days before the Feb. 29 primary, was endorsed by The State, South Carolina's second largest paper. The former South Bend, Ind., mayor has struggled to gain support from African American voters – the majority in South Carolina. Yet, in backing him, The State noted that Democrats have succeeded when they "resisted the temptation to pick status-quo nominees and shown the courage to choose centrist outsiders with fresh, optimistic messages."
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar trails badly in national presidential polls, but she's in first place when it comes to winning support of newspapers. According to my count, of 16 paid-circulation dailies to make endorsements to date, she has been the choice of 10.
In New Hampshire's primary, Klobuchar finished a surprising third – closer to first than to fourth – and generated over $12 million in contributions. It didn't hurt that in the closing days she was endorsed by the state's Seacoast Media Group, the Keene Sentinel, and New Hampshire's largest paper, the Manchester Union Leader.
"The Democratic nominee needs to have a proven and substantial record of accomplishment across party lines," wrote the Union Leader, citing Klobuchar's "ability to unite rather than divide, and the strength and stamina to go toe-to-toe with the Tweeter-in-Chief."
Her earliest endorsement came from The New York Times on Jan. 19. Although the paper split its support between Klobuchar and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, it called Klobuchar "the standard-bearer for the Democratic center." The editorial praised her as "the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit and sticktoitiveness."
In Iowa, Klobuchar picked up endorsements from two dailies, while the state's largest paper, the Des Moines Register, gave its support to Warren.
There hasn't been a lot of research regarding the value of print endorsements, but back in 2008, Pew found that only 14% of readers indicated that a local newspaper endorsement would be likely to have a positive influence on their votes. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was endorsed by 55 of the nation's 60 largest papers making endorsements, yet Donald Trump got the last laugh.
I'm convinced that newspaper endorsements carry weight that goes beyond paid circulation. In the current race, many Democrats are torn and thirsting for persuasive rationale.
Editorial boards are nearly unanimous in advocating a center-left choice, not an ultra-progressive. That view might yet be worth more than the paper it's written on.

Hungry for intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

Texto completo: The Russians are like the devil. Each gets blamed (or credited) with more than they are responsible for.
Intelligence officials recently went to Capitol Hill where, according to The Hill, "they briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia interfering in the presidential race in an effort to get Trump re-elected." The initial presumption was that Russian President Vladimir Putin favors Trump's reelection. Why would he when he has someone more closely associated with his ideology than Trump? That would be the self-described democratic socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
But wait. Following closely on this unspecific leak to (where else?) the New York Times, we now hear that Russia wants Sanders as the next president. Perhaps it's out of gratitude because he and his wife honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Ah, nostalgia.
The intelligence briefing was classified, but as with charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, no details have emerged that prove the Russian "collusion" narrative. Other than disinformation campaigns on social media (and plenty of disinformation has and will continue to be generated here at home through mainstream media) we have still not heard any specifics on how Russia managed to change a single vote in 2016, or how they supposedly intend to do so this time around. Upon hearing of the intelligence briefing, Putin's press secretary told Russian state-run media, "This is another in a series of paranoid reports, and we regret to say that their number will grow as the election approaches. They certainly have nothing to do with the truth."
The reason Democrats are again raising the prospect of Russian interference is to undermine the credibility of this year's election should Trump win again, as seems increasingly likely. Democrats have been unable to stomach, not only his 2016 election, but also his economic successes. They fear their party will lose what remaining but dwindling appeal it might still enjoy. That's why in the debates among Democratic presidential candidates one hears of an America that isn't recognizable to most citizens. For them, America is a bad country, a place of racism, sexism, inequality and misery only they can fix, though previous Democratic presidents who have made similar diagnoses of America's "faults" have done nothing to repair the damage to which they have arguably contributed. Trump appears to have stolen their issues and they have no fallback position.
As for the credibility of American intelligence, consider their record during George W. Bush's administration, beginning with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which were never found, resulting in the deaths of many in the unnecessary war that followed.
This Russian interference claim seems like a setup and an invitation for the House to conduct even more investigations and possibly new articles of impeachment after the election, assuming Democrats maintain their House majority. A recent Gallup Poll shows record high approval (49%) of the president's policies. Meanwhile, 43% of independents polled now support the president - the highest percentage during Trump's entire presidency. We'll see if that translates into Republican victories in races for the Senate and House.
According to Gallup, "The latest survey finds a further increase in national satisfaction, with 45% now satisfied, the highest since February 2005."
Democrats have always needed a boogeyman to run against. Recall "The Gingrich who stole Christmas" line disparaging then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich on a Time magazine cover in the 1990s. Democrats have also demagogued Republicans for not helping the poor and for being racist. That is a harder sell with the African American unemployment rate at record lows and wages rising for virtually all groups. According to the Census Bureau, the poverty level is as low as its been in 11 years.
Russia has become the default boogeyman of the left. That is what makes Bernie Sanders the ideal candidate for Russia and the other socialist-communist states he has praised, because in his heart he is at one with them.

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - To many in the eastern Delhi neighborhood where a convulsion of religious violence erupted this week, it all began with one man.
Kapil Mishra, a local politician with India's leading Hindu nationalist party, had just lost an election. Acquaintances in the area, which now feels like a war zone, said he had been looking for a way to bounce back.
Mishra, 39, is known for his outspoken views and flexible politics. As an upper caste Hindu from a political family, he had worked for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and risen in the ranks of one of India's most progressive political organizations.
But several years ago he shifted allegiance across the political spectrum to the Bharatiya Janata Party, India's current governing party, which has deep roots in Hindu supremacist ideology.
On Sunday, he appeared at a rally against a group of protesters (most of them women) who were objecting to a new citizenship law widely seen as discriminatory toward Muslims. There he vented his anger in a fiery speech in which he issued an ultimatum to police: Either clear out the demonstrators, who were blocking a main road, or he and his followers would do it themselves.
Within hours, the worst Hindu-Muslim violence in India in years was exploding. Gangs of Hindus and Muslims fought each other with swords and bats, shops burst into flames, chunks of bricks sailed through the air, and mobs rained blows on cornered men.
"Kapil Mishra should be in jail," said Rupesh Bathla, a businessman who says he has known Mishra since they were teenagers. "He started communal riots. He planted hatred in other people's hearts."
By Wednesday, at least 24 people had died, hospital officials said, most from gunshot wounds. Several witnesses said the live fire came from the direction of the police officers, and the dead included Hindus as well as Muslims.
Though property belonging to Hindus was burned, the destruction was much heavier on the Muslim side.
In Muslim areas, shop after shop was destroyed and entire markets were burned down. Dozens of Muslim residents have accused police officers of standing passively by while the destruction was underway.
With the violence cooling down for the moment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hosted President Donald Trump as the fighting raged, broke his silence Wednesday after Trump had departed, urging people in a Twitter post to "maintain peace and brotherhood at all times." He added: "Peace and harmony are central to our ethos."
But concerns lingered among many Indians, including Hindus, that Mishra and his Hindu nationalist supporters have weaponized a very dangerous mood.
Protests against the new citizenship law, which makes it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become full-fledged Indian citizens, have flared intermittently since December. But this past week was the first time the protests turned large numbers of Hindus and Muslims violently against one another.

Congress' spending power is shrinking Lawmakers have few but selves to blame, experts say

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - When the Pentagon announced this month that it would divert billions more dollars in military funding to the construction of President Donald Trump's border wall, bipartisan outrage ricocheted across Capitol Hill.
Republicans and Democrats alike issued fiery statements in defense of both their congressional districts, some of which stand to lose valuable work making military equipment, and their constitutionally enshrined power of the purse.
But the howls of protest are unlikely to amount to much in a Congress where lawmakers - many of whom once prized their spending prerogatives almost above all else - acknowledge their power to steer federal dollars has been severely eroded.
The dysfunction has taken hold in large part because of decisions that members of Congress themselves have made.
But it has become pronounced under Trump, who has moved aggressively to divert government money when it suits his agenda.
"Congress' appropriation power, which is pretty much the last unchallenged power that Congress has, has very significantly eroded," said Sean Kelly, a professor of political science at California State University Channel Islands.
The root of the problem predates Trump. For years, Congress has jammed through huge omnibus spending bills that set funding for an entire fiscal year in the final days of legislative sessions.
Lawmakers have also passed a patchwork of short-term spending bills to keep the government from shutting down, which has happened three times during the Trump administration. And while presidents have always had the power to transfer and reallocate funds, Trump has made far wider use of that authority to subvert the will of lawmakers.
The administration is expected to announce another diversion of funds to help pay for construction of a wall on the southern border, Trump's signature campaign promise, in the coming months. The president declared a national emergency last year to allow him to use money not appropriated for the wall to build it.
And while the Senate acquitted Trump this month of impeachment charges stemming from his decision to withhold military funding from Ukraine, the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Trump's actions violated the Impoundment Control Act, which limits a president's ability to refuse to spend money allocated by Congress.
Several lawmakers, including some who are still deeply involved in crafting the dozen must-pass spending bills each year, acknowledge that the annual fiscal process no longer works as it once did.
A large factor, several say, is the demise of earmarks, the power to steer money to lawmakers' pet projects in order to persuade them to take tough votes. Long scorned as a tool of corruption, Congress ultimately banned the practice after a series of scandals that culminated in the imprisonment of lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
"When earmarks were around, they gave members a reason to pay attention to appropriations - they always knew they had some skin in the game," said Kelly, who co-wrote a book about earmarks and their benefit to democracy. "By being penny-wise, we've sort of been pound-foolish."
Some lawmakers in both parties have quietly begun discussing reviving earmarks in a bid to help grease the gears of the spending process. Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, embarked on a listening tour among her colleagues about rebranding earmarks as "community project funding" and implementing more guardrails to avoid abuse.
Trump has also suggested bringing the practice back in some form.
"Members of Congress have the best judgment about what's needed for their districts," Lowey said in an interview in which she described how the administration now wields far more discretion in doling out funds for projects. "Local projects and spending bills also give members a sense of ownership of federal funding."
But the idea has been shelved for the time being. House Democratic leaders hope to pass all 12 spending bills by the end of June, and any effort to revive earmarks was seen as too complex and politically fraught to pursue in such a short time frame and in an election year.
"Clearly, there's a sentiment in the institution that we surrender too much power," said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., a member of the Appropriations Committee, who supports the idea of bringing back the practice in some form. "How you get that power back without undercutting the current chief executive, and how you have that discussion in a way that it doesn't partisan-ize it and sends everybody to their corners, is really going to be very tricky."
Fiscal conservatives - particularly Republicans who ran for Congress as budget hawks bent on lowering the debt and reducing government spending - are reluctant to undercut that message now by embracing earmarks.
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who railed against spending during his years as a South Carolina congressman, acknowledged in a recent private question-and-answer session that Republicans are less interested in deficit reduction now that a member of their party is in the White House.
A Democratic aide, insisting on anonymity to describe internal discussions, said that party leaders planned to revisit the discussion of earmarks next year, given the near-unanimous support for it among their members in Congress.
In the meantime, the administration has taken advantage of the natural murkiness that comes with funding programs and policy - and encountered little resistance from lawmakers.
"Congress has been more and more deferential to the president when they're of the same party," said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. "But on the other hand, we haven't seen a president deviate from appropriations to such a degree."
While the Government Accountability Office found that Trump's decision to withhold $391 million in security assistance for Ukraine violated the law, there is no action or penalty that can be taken as a result.
"These parchment barriers are only as effective so far as when people in power hold themselves to the law," said James Pfiffner, a professor at George Mason University who wrote a book about the impoundment act. "If the person with the most power says, 'I'm not going to play by the rules of the game,' the other people may have the authority, but not the power to enforce the law."

Texto completo: ROME - Two former schoolmates from California sat impassively in a courtroom Wednesday for the start of their trial for the murder of a plainclothes Italian policeman while they were vacationing in Rome last summer.
In pretrial court documents, prosecutors alleged that Finnegan Lee Elder, now 20, thrust a7-inch knife repeatedly into Carabiniere Vice Brigadier Mario Cerciello, while his friend, Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, now 19, scuffled with the officer's partner.
The jailed defendants have contended they didn't realize the officers were plainclothes police but mistook them for criminals following a thwarted cocaine sale hours earlier in a Rome nightlife district.
Just a row behind them was the widow of Cerciello, who was killed only days after he returned to duty from his honeymoon.
Elder, according to pretrial documents, admitted to the stabbing but said he acted in self-defense when he feared the burly Cerciello was strangling him.
Natale-Hjorth has also told authorities he acted in self-defense, alleging that he and his friend were assaulted by the police officers, so he scuffled with Cerciello's partner, Andrea Varriale. The partner suffered kicks and scratches, according to prosecutors.
According to judicial documents, Natale-Hjorth said he didn't know Elder had the knife. Prosecutors contend that after the stabbing, Natale-Hjorth hid the knife behind a ceiling panel in their hotel room.
Under Italian law, accomplices to an alleged murderer can also be charged with the murder itself. Italy's stiffest criminal punishment is life imprisonment.
Congress warns Pentagon not to shift funds for Trump wall
WASHINGTON - Lawmakers from both parties told Pentagon leaders on Wednesday that the Defense Department is undermining its own efforts to get military money by diverting billions of dollars for the construction of President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the committee's top Republican warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper that overturning congressional funding decisions will have consequences.
Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that Congress may place greater restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to shift money to meet military needs.
The chairman, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said: "The message it sends is the Pentagon has plenty of money," and "undercuts any arguments for any need for resources."
Trump campaign sues paper over 2019 opinion article
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's reelection campaign sued The New York Times on Wednesday, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements claiming his 2016 election campaign had an agreement with Russia to exchange positive foreign policy for help defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton.
The suit, filed in New York State Court, alleges that The Times published a defamatory opinion piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign argues in the suit.
The Times published the piece because of its "extreme bias ... and animosity," the lawsuit said.
Spain cancels tenor Domingo's part in two opera dates in May
MADRID - Spain's Culture Ministry said Wednesday it canceled tenor Placido Domingo's participation in Madrid's La Zarzuela light opera theater in May, a day after the legendary singer said he accepted "full responsibility" for his actions that led to accusations of sexual misconduct.
It is the first time a performance by Domingo has been canceled in Europe since allegations surfaced of sexual misconduct by the singer.
The Culture Ministry's decision came a day after the U.S. union representing opera performers said its investigators found the opera star and former general director at Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera had behaved inappropriately over the course of two decades when he held senior management positions at the companies.
Lawsuit: Miss. prison has 'abhorrent conditions'
JACKSON, Miss. - The Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman is a violent, rat-infested place where inmates live in "abhorrent conditions" and their medical needs are routinely ignored, attorneys say in a new lawsuit filed on behalf of 152 prisoners
The suit was filed in federal court Tuesday, and attorneys are asking for class-action status to cover all current and future inmates at Parchman. It eventually could be merged with a similar lawsuit filed in January on behalf of 33 other Parchman inmates.
At least 19 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December, many from outbursts of violence at Parchman and other prisons.
The U.S. Justice Department announced on Feb. 5 that its civil rights division would investigate Parchman and other Mississippi prisons.
Court sides with Trump
in sanctuary grant fight
NEW YORK - The Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement grants to force states to cooperate with immigration enforcement, a federal appeals court in New York ruled Wednesday in a decision that conflicted with three other federal appeals courts.
The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned a lower court's decision ordering the administration to release funding to New York City and seven states - New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island.
Federal appeals courts in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have ruled against the U.S. government by upholding lower-court injunctions placed on the enforcement of some or all of the challenged conditions.
In Wyoming: Sharpshooters in a helicopter killed 36 mountain goats in a contested effort to eradicate the nonnative animals from Grand Teton National Park.
Four days after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to stop the shooting on the day it began, park officials released the tally Tuesday.
About 100 mountain goats, descendants of animals introduced outside the park decades ago, inhabit the Teton Range. Using a combination of shooters in the air and eventually on the ground, park officials say they want to eradicate the goats because they compete with bighorn sheep for food and habitat and can spread diseases including pneumonia to the native animals.

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, a university and a church.
The charges, announced Wednesday in Virginia and Washington state, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group.
In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as "swatting" - calling police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing authorities to respond in force.
In one instance, prosecutors said, Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen.
In other cases in 2018 and 2019, prosecutors said, Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University, Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and an unnamed Cabinet official who authorities said was under Secret Service protection. Last month, prosecutors said, Denton met with an undercover FBI agent and described his efforts.
"Denton said that if he was 'raided' for swatting ProPublica, then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime," Jonathan Myles Lund, an FBI agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Denton and others.
Authorities said Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University.
In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen's chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington, described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Florida; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Arizona.
Authorities said the quartet devised an operation called Erste Saule, or "first pillar" in German, which Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target "journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message."
The goal, Shea said, was to "erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act."
Prosecutors said Cole and Shea were the "primary organizers." When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Shea and Cole offered praise. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel "terrorized." Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges.
Authorities said Cole and Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets.
Raymond Duda, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Seattle, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement's radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and "hate camps." He said the FBI was continuing to investigate the group around the country.

Not all it's cracked up to be Streaming TV's boom is a mixed blessing for some Hollywood writers

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."

Ex-White House doctor takes a shot at House seat Physician getting belated boost from Trump allies in run

Texto completo: WICHITA FALLS, Texas - Dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, with an American flag pin on his lapel, Dr. Ronny Jackson rolled up at the Red River Harley-Davidson outpost to make his pitch to voters.
"I just came from the White House," Jackson, the former White House physician, told the small crowd gathered upstairs from the Harley showroom. "I've been working side by side with the president. I know all the Cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser. I can pick the phone up and I can call them. They're all friends of mine."
Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from President Donald Trump's physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct.
Now he's running for Congress in Texas' 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple. In a primary field of 15 anti-immigrant, anti-abortion Republicans, Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election.
Standing alongside other candidates wearing cowboy hats and "Make America Great Again" caps at the forum Feb. 20, Jackson pitched himself as the only one "who can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, 'Sir, I need you to stop what you're doing and listen to me,' and he will stop what he's doing and listen to me."
That access, he said, would make him a powerful replacement for Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican who announced last fall he would not seek reelection after representing his district for more than a quarter of a century.
But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate. There have been more than a few.
His campaign organization, for one thing.
Jackson's campaign manager, he said, is "a horse doctor" with a full-time job. He has one full-time staff member, a recent college graduate who is also working for free, and he has relied on his wife, Jane, to drive him around the Panhandle-encompassing district, which spans 41 counties. And despite having a power Rolodex, he has never reached into it to ask the right people for help.
Trump, who now generally adheres to rules put in place by his political shop about whom he endorses and what races he weighs in on, has been silent about Jackson's campaign.
Jackson is now facing an uphill battle against two well-funded and connected opponents - Chris Ekstrom, a Dallas millionaire who recently moved to the district to run and is self-funding his campaign, and Josh Winegarner, a lobbyist who has the backing of the cattle industry he represents and Thornberry.
But Jackson's connections to the Trump administration as well as the president and his family are real, even if they have not translated into much support.
Eric Trump has tweeted a supportive message, and Trump has privately encouraged Jackson to run. And Jackson is benefiting, if belatedly, from Trump allies and aides who have only recently realized he needed help and have pitched in, setting him up with a real online fundraising and phone prospecting operation, which helped to finally get him on air with a commercial - a 30-second spot made up entirely of old clips of Trump praising his character.
Jackson, 52, who served in the White House medical unit under the past three presidents, grew close to Trump after delivering the results of a presidential physical in a briefing at which he promoted Trump's "incredible genes," said he did "exceedingly well" on a cognitive test and claimed that if he had adhered to a better diet over the past 20 years, he could have lived to be 200.
"That was the day I got the Trump stamp on me completely," Jackson said. . "I was no longer viewed as a nonpartisan physician on military orders, even though I still technically was. What I didn't realize was that it made people much more aggressive toward me when the VA nomination came up."
At the time of the allegations against him - which included loosely dispensing strong drugs to lawmakers and political aides - Jackson was not allowed to respond because he was an active-duty military officer.
Jackson called the allegations against him "complete garbage."
But for Jackson, the question will be whether the last-ditch help from Trump world has come too late - by Friday, more than half of the vote will already be in because of early voting in the March 3 primary.

Texto completo: ROME - Two former schoolmates from California sat impassively in a courtroom Wednesday for the start of their trial for the murder of a plainclothes Italian policeman while they were vacationing in Rome last summer.
In pretrial court documents, prosecutors alleged that Finnegan Lee Elder, now 20, thrust a7-inch knife repeatedly into Carabiniere Vice Brigadier Mario Cerciello, while his friend, Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, now 19, scuffled with the officer's partner.
The jailed defendants have contended they didn't realize the officers were plainclothes police but mistook them for criminals following a thwarted cocaine sale hours earlier in a Rome nightlife district.
Just a row behind them was the widow of Cerciello, who was killed only days after he returned to duty from his honeymoon.
Elder, according to pretrial documents, admitted to the stabbing but said he acted in self-defense when he feared the burly Cerciello was strangling him.
Natale-Hjorth has also told authorities he acted in self-defense, alleging that he and his friend were assaulted by the police officers, so he scuffled with Cerciello's partner, Andrea Varriale. The partner suffered kicks and scratches, according to prosecutors.
According to judicial documents, Natale-Hjorth said he didn't know Elder had the knife. Prosecutors contend that after the stabbing, Natale-Hjorth hid the knife behind a ceiling panel in their hotel room.
Under Italian law, accomplices to an alleged murderer can also be charged with the murder itself. Italy's stiffest criminal punishment is life imprisonment.
Congress warns Pentagon not to shift funds for Trump wall
WASHINGTON - Lawmakers from both parties told Pentagon leaders on Wednesday that the Defense Department is undermining its own efforts to get military money by diverting billions of dollars for the construction of President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the committee's top Republican warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper that overturning congressional funding decisions will have consequences.
Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that Congress may place greater restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to shift money to meet military needs.
The chairman, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said: "The message it sends is the Pentagon has plenty of money," and "undercuts any arguments for any need for resources."
Trump campaign sues paper over 2019 opinion article
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's reelection campaign sued The New York Times on Wednesday, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements claiming his 2016 election campaign had an agreement with Russia to exchange positive foreign policy for help defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton.
The suit, filed in New York State Court, alleges that The Times published a defamatory opinion piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign argues in the suit.
The Times published the piece because of its "extreme bias ... and animosity," the lawsuit said.
Spain cancels tenor Domingo's part in two opera dates in May
MADRID - Spain's Culture Ministry said Wednesday it canceled tenor Placido Domingo's participation in Madrid's La Zarzuela light opera theater in May, a day after the legendary singer said he accepted "full responsibility" for his actions that led to accusations of sexual misconduct.
It is the first time a performance by Domingo has been canceled in Europe since allegations surfaced of sexual misconduct by the singer.
The Culture Ministry's decision came a day after the U.S. union representing opera performers said its investigators found the opera star and former general director at Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera had behaved inappropriately over the course of two decades when he held senior management positions at the companies.
Lawsuit: Miss. prison has 'abhorrent conditions'
JACKSON, Miss. - The Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman is a violent, rat-infested place where inmates live in "abhorrent conditions" and their medical needs are routinely ignored, attorneys say in a new lawsuit filed on behalf of 152 prisoners
The suit was filed in federal court Tuesday, and attorneys are asking for class-action status to cover all current and future inmates at Parchman. It eventually could be merged with a similar lawsuit filed in January on behalf of 33 other Parchman inmates.
At least 19 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December, many from outbursts of violence at Parchman and other prisons.
The U.S. Justice Department announced on Feb. 5 that its civil rights division would investigate Parchman and other Mississippi prisons.
24 dead in India riots
NEW DELHI - At least 24 people are dead, hospital officials said, in the worst violence Delhi has seen in decades.
Several witnesses said the live fire came from the direction of the police officers, and the dead included Hindus as well as Muslims.
Gangs of Hindus and Muslims fought each other with swords and bats, shops burst into flames, chunks of bricks sailed through the air, and mobs rained blows on cornered men.
Though property belonging to Hindus was burned, the destruction was much heavier on the Muslim side.
In Muslim areas, shop after shop was destroyed and entire markets were burned down.
Dozens of Muslim residents have accused police officers of standing passively by while the destruction was underway.
In Wyoming: Sharpshooters in a helicopter killed 36 mountain goats in a contested effort to eradicate the nonnative animals from Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
Four days after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to stop the shooting on the day it began, park officials released the tally Tuesday to the Jackson Hole News & Guide.
About 100 mountain goats, descendants of animals introduced outside the park decades ago, inhabit the Teton Range. Using a combination of shooters in the air and eventually on the ground, park officials say they want to eradicate the goats because they compete with bighorn sheep for food and habitat and can spread diseases including pneumonia to the native animals.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."

Texto completo: President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, but it didn't go into effect until three months later, on the the first day of 1863.
That day, free blacks gathered in Norfolk to celebrate with a huge parade that prompted attention from national newspapers - despite the fact the Emancipation Proclamation didn't apply to them.
The New York Times estimated around 4,000 black residents joined in a procession "celebrating the advent of freedom" in a southern city that, by this time, had been in the control of Union forces for more than seven months.
Headed by a band of drums and fifes and accompanied by 500 black soldiers, they marched from Market Street to the corner of Botetourt and Freemason, where Union Army general and then-military governor of Norfolk, Egbert Viele, addressed the crowd.
"They carried several Union flags, and cheered loudly for the downfall of African Slavery," the dispatch from the New York Times said.
Afterward, the parade continued on to the Old Fairgrounds, along Church Street north of Elmwood Cemetery. Historian Cassandra Newby-Alexander said the black crowd stopped there to burn an effigy of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
"Norfolk's whites were outraged by this demonstration, but they were powerless to stop it," Newby-Alexander said.
The area was crawling with Union soldiers and under strict martial law.
Many marching that day were part of Norfolk's robust community of free blacks, while others had recently become free by virtue of their work for the Union military. However, a third group were left to linger in a legal gray area when the proclamation went into effect, Newby-Alexander said.
Fearing political fallout from border states that were still aligned with the Union but where slavery was still in effect, Lincoln worded the Emancipation Proclamation very carefully to free only those slaves who were living in states or parts of states that were "in rebellion against the United States."
This specifically did not include Union-controlled territory in the Confederate states. Lincoln's proclamation goes so far as to list the exceptions, including Norfolk and Portsmouth, along with surrounding counties like Berkley and Princess Anne. Northern forces had taken control of south Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore in May of 1862.
The Proclamation's wording and a hodge-podge of contradictory laws and policies left those who had been slaves before the Union Army took control in an odd legal position.
"They were not technically free, but they were not anyone's slave anymore," Newby-Alexander said.
Regardless of what the law said, those folks walked free on Norfolk's streets and celebrated alongside other free blacks on the day the proclamation took effect.

Visiting NJ Maritime Museum could help you live longer

Texto completo: No fake news here. "Going to Museums May be Good for Your Health" is the title of a recent New York Times article. "People engaged in the arts lived longer than those who were not, a study found."
The New Jersey Maritime Museum can attest to the above. Visitors of all ages come in with smiling faces, questions galore, and bring stories of their own. Docents are equally friendly, full of New Jersey's history, and can usually answer most questions, find a book with the information sought, or give them the name and email of someone who can.
"There is evidence that simply being exposed to the arts may help people ... who just went to a museum just once or twice a year were 14% less likely less likely to die during that period."
Put visiting the NJ Maritime Museum a few times a year on your calendar or in your head. That should increase your chances of living longer.
To continue with excerpts from the New York Times article:
"Researchers theorized that people who expose themselves to the arts are more likely to be engaged in the world. Being involved and excited by the arts keeps and maintains your purpose in life.
"The study also noted that engaging in the arts can reduce loneliness, promote empathy and emotional intelligence, and keep people from becoming sedentary – all factors that contribute to a longer life."
The above could be a personal advertisement for volunteering at the NJ Maritime Museum. Needed are summer volunteers (June – Labor Day weekend) who will donate one day a week of their time to greet visitors and show them around. Also needed are year round volunteers to come in on their own time to organize some of the 400 GB of scanned high resolution photos and rare documents.
Are you looking for an internship in the coming months? The museum needs people of all ages and abilities. For example, can you write grants? Call 609-492-0202 or email info@NJMM.org. Like Uncle Sam pointed in World War II posters, "We Want You." You won't find a finer group of people who can laugh and yet get the job done than at the NJ Maritime Museum.
"Similar studies have shown the benefits of exposing children and adolescents to art, and found that children who were taken to on field trips to museums performed better in school and higher on standardized tests than those who did not take field trips."
Grade school children and older ones who know more history love the museum. They are full of questions, and get a small education about New Jersey maritime and local history that is no longer taught in schools. We love kids and they love us.
"Advocates said the study was a reminder of how critical it is for the arts to be more accessible to Americans of all incomes."
There is no admission charge to visit the NJ Maritime Museum at 528 Dock Road. in Beach Haven. Donations are cheerfully accepted in boxes if people choose.
Nast Dive Room Speaking of donations, the family foundation of Michael G. Nast has made a donation in his honor, and the dive room at the museum will be officially named the Michael G. Nast Dive Room. Michael was born in Mount Holly, graduated from Haverford College and Cornell Law School.
Michael died doing what he loved best, diving. He was an accomplished New Jersey wreck diver, and participated in Long Beach Island events including the 18 Mile Run. In addition he loved fishing and hunting. Michael Nast was an assistant district attorney in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and was active in the American Bar Association. New exhibits will be on display this coming summer in the Michael G. Nast Diving Room.
"Peace, tranquility, and rejuvenation" are mentioned in the New York Times article. Peace may be found by learning the fate of a loved one at sea. Rejuvenation can be found when members and visitors echo "I never knew that!" But the NJ Maritime Museum does not promise tranquility. Hopefully, all visitors will be excited, taking pictures, asking questions and telling stories of their own.
Make a resolution in 2020 to visit, join, and volunteer at the New Jersey Maritime Museum. Volunteers are needed, and the New York Times article has just proved that the public needs the NJ Maritime Museum.

Sen. Brown: Trump 'trying to cheat' to win

Texto completo: Sen. Sherrod Brown said President Donald Trump is "is trying to cheat" to win re-election by working with Russians to help his re-election campaign.
During a conference call with reporters Tuesday, Brown called Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin "untoward" and "questionable," and said "the evidence continues to point" toward his campaign working with Russians.
"He encourages them. He says things. He defends them. He criticizes his own intelligence officials. That strikes me as working with them by most measures," he said.
Last week, the New York Times reported that intelligence officials told lawmakers that Russia already was interfering in the 2020 election in an attempt to help Trump get reelected. Bernie Sanders' campaign also was briefed by intelligence officials who told the campaign that Russia has been trying to help the Vermont senator's bid.
Trump dismissed the claims Tuesday during a two-day trip to India, according to the Times. Trump tweeted Monday: "U.S. Intelligence official overstated assessment of Russian efforts to help Trump. ... This is all a big scam between Intel and the Democrats."
Brown said, "Imagine going back five years, 10 years, 20 years, that the president of the Untied States was working with the Russians of all countries to help his own election, 95% of the country would be outraged. Now Trump voters aren't because that's what he does. It doesn't make it any less wrong."
Trump's campaign called Brown's comments a conspiracy theory.
"The fact is, since President Trump first carried Ohio, he has delivered historic tax cuts, created new jobs, and negotiated critical trade deals to benefit the Buckeye state. And his winning agenda is why he'll carry Ohio again this November," Ohio campaign spokesman Dan Luscheck wrote in an email.
On Monday, Brown and other Senate Democrats wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that they should act "immediately and forcefully" to sanction Russia and those connected to the country who attempt to interfere in U.S. elections. That includes Putin.
"It is long past time for the administration to send a direct, powerful and unmistakable message to President Putin: the U.S. will respond immediately and forcefully to continuing election interference," they wrote.
The administration has a "broad range of hard-hitting sanctions tools," according to the letter. They include executive orders and acts of Congress that empower them to act against foreign adversaries attempting to influence U.S. elections. "There is virtually no security threat more serious than that posed by those who would systematically undermine confidence in, and the effective operation of, our democratic elections," they wrote.

Covington Catholic students sue over tweets related to Lincoln Memorial incident

Texto completo: A group of Covington Catholic High School students are suing CNN, NBC, the Washington Post, nine media personalities and a New York doctor regarding commentary about the incident at the Lincoln Memorial last year.
The group of 12 students recently filed four separate federal lawsuits and one suit in Kenton County Circuit Court.
The federal lawsuits against the media outlets state that the students were defamed, had their privacy invaded and that false coverage led to death threats and personal attacks.
Covington Catholic student Nick Sandmann has separately sued the Washington Post, NBC and CNN in the wake of the viral video filmed on Jan. 18, 2019.
Sandmann was 16, and also a student at Covington Catholic High School. He and his classmates were in Washington D.C. for the March for Life.
In the video, he was wearing a red Make America Great Again hat and stood face to face with Nathan Phillips, a Native American activist.
Sandmann did not shout or say anything to Phillips. On video, he does not appear to engage verbally in any way. However, the images of shouting students surrounding Sandmann and Phillips and the interaction between Native Americans and students cast the whole situation in a political light.
The incident received nationwide coverage and created a firestorm on Twitter. As more footage was released, it was revealed that Phillips had approached the teens, not the other way around.
Sandmann is not a party in the lawsuits filed.
The 'wanted poster' Unique among the cases is the lawsuit against Sujana Chandrasekhar, whose Twitter account now appears to have been deleted.
Chandrasekhar is a New York ear, nose and throat doctor.
The lawsuit claims she posted what the lawyers dubbed a "wanted poster," an image showing the faces of dozens of Covington Catholic students.
Beside the faces is the Covington Catholic High School logo and the words: "Do you know them? The world would like to know too."
Chandrasekhar's alleged tweet, accompanying the image, reads: "These are scary faces, indeed. #CovingtonShame."
"Chandrasekhar repeatedly engaged in such a doxing campaign against the Plaintiffs," the lawsuit states. The lawsuit does not claim that the doctor created the image, but publicized, promoted and popularized it.
Tweets from media personalities The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Kenton County Circuit Court states the students were subjected to "public denunciations, calls for public harassment and public demands of school expulsion."
The media personalities named in the new lawsuit are Jeffrey Shaun King, Kevin Kruse, Reza Aslan, Maggie Haberman, Ana Navarro, Matthew John Dowd, Clara Jeffery, Adam Edelen and Jodi Jacobson.
Most of the lawsuit focuses on tweets posted by the defendants:
King, a Brooklyn-based activist, allegedly said the teens "surrounded and mocked a beloved Native American elder."
According to the lawsuit, Kruse, an author, tweeted that the students mocked Phillips, taunted women and "shouted 'it's not rape if you enjoy it.'"
Azlan, a former CNN commentator, posted a photo of Sandmann and Phillips on Twitter asking if anyone had ever seen a more "punchable" face, according to the suit.
Haberman, a White House correspondent for the New York Times and an analyst for CNN, allegedly tweeted: "Will be interesting to see if anyone is actually expelled, as officials suggest is possible."
Navarro, a commentator on CNN, Telemundo and The View, posted a tweet describing the video as showing a "Native-American elder taunted by racist MAGA-hat wearing teens," according to the suit.
Dowd, an ABC News political analyst, allegedly tweeted: "Let us not let these kids, their parents and their school off the hook."
Jeffery, editor-in-chief of Mother Jones, tweeted that videos showed "Covington Catholic kids: making cavemen gestures at BHI; tomahawk chanting at Natives; taunting random women," the complaint states.
The suit states, Edelen, a former Kentucky politician, retweeted an article "with false factual statements (sic)" about the students and called their behavior "outrageous and abhorrent."
Jacobson, the former editor-in-chief for Rewire.News, is alleged to have written an article containing false statements about the students titled, "White-Washing White Supremacy: Media Rushes to Excuse Covington Catholic Students."
The civil lawsuit states the students were defamed, harassed, threatened and had their privacy invaded among other charges.
The complaint says the defendants "knowingly" encouraged the unlawful conduct of other people against the students. The students' lawyers also argue that the public ridicule the students faced was foreseeable – the defendants knew it would happen.
The students are being represented by Piston Seifried & Schloemer Attorneys at Law.
"Our clients filed these actions to protect and safeguard their legal and Constitutional rights and those of other children who may be maligned, attacked and damaged," a statement from the law firm said. "Such harmful conduct, which springs from a seemingly deep seated contempt for our clients' race, religious beliefs, and political ideology, cannot go unchallenged."
The students are seeking compensatory and punitive damages. The case has been assigned to Judge Gregory Bartlett.

Texto completo: Based on the tone of Tuesday's Democratic debate, you'd think the Kremlin has already determined the outcome of the presidential election. Former Vice President Joe Biden said Russians are "engaged now, as I speak, in interfering in our election." Billionaire Tom Steyer said there is "an attack by a hostile foreign power on our democracy right now." Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg charged that Russia was backing Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to ensure a Trump victory.
Clearly, the Russia scaremongering is in full swing. Last week's intelligence testimony that the Kremlin is backing President Donald Trump made headline news. Another report emerged alleging Moscow is backing Sanders. Biden claimed that Bernie-backing Russian bots have been attacking him on Facebook. And Hillary Clinton told a foreign audience that "Russians are back in our cyber systems," and that "anyone who tries to deny it" is living in a "sad dreamworld."
Moscow no doubt is up to something, seeking to create chaos and discredit democracy. So are other malign actors. But it is safe to say the greatest practical effect Russia will have is serving as a narrative platform for Americans to generate increasingly strident headlines, tweets and sound bites discrediting the election. This will happen whether Russian President Vladimir Putin lifts a finger or not.
First, let's acknowledge that Moscow's attempts to undermine American democracy did not start in 2016, or even back in the 1980s when Sanders was there on his honeymoon. Interference in foreign politics has been a fixture of the Kremlin's foreign strategy for 100years. These efforts have had no discernible impact on American politics, other than occasionally to provide talking points for left-wing radicals.
Balance concern and knowledge
There is no reason to suspect Russia will improve its record in shaping American elections. The Mueller report detailed the efforts of Kremlin-linked activists to interfere in the 2016 election, but it did not conclude that these crude propaganda efforts influenced the outcome.
We should balance our legitimate concern that the Russians are trying to sway the electorate with the knowledge that they are not very good at it.
Even so, technology has made these influence operations easier to execute. Social media have empowered superficial and emotional messaging regardless of the source. And Americans hardly need Moscow to push divisive ideas. Any glance at Twitter reveals how bitter our politics has become, whether traffic is driven organically by memelords or paid for by Bloomberg.
Yet the Russian interference narrative has become entrenched.
When intelligence community election expert Shelby Pierson speculated to the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting that Russia was trying to help President Trump get reelected, it quickly leaked, became a front-page story in The New York Times and precipitated the usual outrage. It took a few days for the less dramatic truth to catch up -- that there was no evidence for the "misleading" supposition the Kremlin is pro-Trump; at best Russia may have a "preference" for a "deal-maker."
It is not clear how Russia would benefit from a Trump second term anyway, since the first one has not worked out well for them. President Trump has imposed sanctions on Russia, expelled Russian diplomats, sent arms to Ukraine, sold Patriot missiles to Poland, undercut Russia's natural gas markets in Europe, pursued nuclear modernization while not rushing to renew the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and even killed hundreds of Russian mercenaries in Syria.
Those who accuse the president of being a Kremlin asset should seriously rethink their premises.
It's not only Moscow
It is also a mistake to blame only Russia for bot campaigns and other forms of election interference. Any foreign government with a grudge against America could be at it. Iran has already tried to hack into the Trump reelection campaign. China may also be involved in seeking to influence the U.S. election; it was recently accused of election meddling in Cambodia and Indonesia.
When incidents take place leaving behind evidence of well-known Russian cyberespionage groups like Fancy Bear, it could well be hackers from other countries trying to cover their tracks. Even Americans could be exploiting the climate of Russophobia to try to hack the election and escape undetected.
The United States should remain aware that malign groups, both foreign and domestic, will seek to exploit the increasingly shrill information domain to tilt the election playing field one way or the other. Forewarned is forearmed.
Nonetheless, Americans should not make it easy for them. We play into the hands of these groups by overreacting to the latest shiny stimulus thrown into the media ecosystem. In that sense, the real problem is much bigger than the Russians; the problem is us.

Texto completo: Clive Cussler, 88, the author and maritime adventurer who captivated millions with his bestselling tales of suspense and who, between books, led scores of expeditions to find historic shipwrecks and lost treasures in the ocean depths, died Monday at his home in suburban Phoenix, Arizona.
His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for his publisher, Penguin Random House. No specific cause was given.
Mayan jungles, undersea kingdoms, ghost ships, evil forces out to destroy the world, beautiful women, heroes modeled on himself - Cussler's vivid literary fantasies and his larger-than-life exploits swirled together for four decades, spinning off some 70 books and locating almost as many shipwrecks.
His work - mostly action thrillers of the James Bond-Indiana Jones kind, plus nonfiction accounts of his marine quests and a few children's books - made him a global celebrity.
His book sales have been staggering - more than 100 million copies, with vast numbers sold in paperback at airports. Translated into 40 or so languages, his books reached The New York Times' bestseller lists more than 20 times, as he amassed a fortune estimated at $80 million.
Often compared to the thrillers churned out by Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum and Ian Fleming, the Cussler novels featured formulaic plots, one- or two-word titles and frequently a recurring hero, Dirk Pitt, an undersea explorer who cheats death and saves the world as he foils the diabolical plots of megalomaniac villains, while satisfying his taste for exotic cars and lusty women.
Cussler was hardly a stylist. Critics called his characters wooden, his dialogue leaden and his prose cliched ("the cold touch of fear," "a narrow brush with death"), while praising his descriptions of marine hardware, underwater struggles and salvage operations.
But readers were swept along on the page-turning tides, and after his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!" (1976), his books were frequently on the bestseller lists for months.
Cussler also connected with readers by turning his love for scuba diving into an oceanic lifestyle that paralleled and validated his superhero.
He first created the National Underwater and Marine Agency as a fictional government organization that employed his hero in the Dirk Pitt books. Then, in 1979, he founded an actual National Underwater and Marine Agency as a private nonprofit group committed to "preserving maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts." It underwrote his maritime ventures.
His first nonfiction book, "The Sea Hunters" (1996, with Craig Dirgo), was an account of his NUMA exploits, some of which were portrayed in television documentaries featuring Cussler as narrator. Valuable artifacts raised by his expeditions were given to museums or governments.
Cussler, who named his franchise hero after his son Dirk, acknowledged that Dirk Pitt's character was his own alter ego. His later novels, many co-written by his son or others, often included himself as a character who saves the day. His son, a daughter and friends were also used as characters in his books.
"I've been doing Dirk Pitt for 30 years," Cussler told the Times in 2000. "Maybe I can find another writer down the line to take him over. It's not the money; it's the fans.
"I'd like to retire," he continued. "I'm toying with the idea of Pitt having a son who shows up. He's getting a little long in the tooth. When we started out, we were both 36 years old. Now he's a little over 40, and I'm pushing 70."
But 20 years later, he was still churning out books, sometimes two a year. His "Journey of the Pharaohs: A Novel From the NUMA Files," written with Graham Brown, is scheduled to be published in March.

Not all it's cracked up to be Streaming TV's boom is a mixed blessing for some Hollywood writers

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."

Texto completo: Hampton
This spectacular Leap Year concert on February 29, is as rare as Linda Eder's exquisite vocal prowess! From pop and standards to jazz and country, Eder has been enchanting audiences since she first burst onto the scene on the televised talent competition "Star Search." Eighteen solo recordings later, she's become a worldwide phenomenon.
Eder's latest album, "If You See Me," pays tribute to Broadway and beyond, delivering her unique song interpretation of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Frank Wildhorn, and more -chosen from a wish list submitted by her fans after requesting suggestions on her social media sites.
"It is her voice - a rangy, flexible throb driven by a seemingly inexhaustible stamina and topped with high notes that grow larger and fuller as she moves up the scale - that leaves you open-mouthed," wrote Stephen Holdren for The New York Times. "With her impeccable intonation, she is an Olympic archer who always hits bull's-eye dead center."
Eder's American Theatre debut marks the acclaimed singer's first performance in Hampton Roads and an exciting opportunity to hear one of the most versatile and purest voices of our generation live onstage.
"Whether you're a fan of The American Songbook, Broadway classics or pop hits, Linda Eder will captivate you with her stratospheric vocals," commented Hampton Arts Artistic Director Richard M. Parison, Jr. "The historic American Theatre is the perfect venue to celebrate her repertoire and share this immense talent to Coastal Virginia."

Bestselling author who found joy in maritime adventures

Texto completo: Clive Cussler, 88, the author and maritime adventurer who captivated millions with his bestselling tales of suspense and who, between books, led scores of expeditions to find historic shipwrecks and lost treasures in the ocean depths, died Monday at his home in suburban Phoenix, Arizona.
His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for his publisher, Penguin Random House. No specific cause was given.
Mayan jungles, undersea kingdoms, ghost ships, evil forces out to destroy the world, beautiful women, heroes modeled on himself - Cussler's vivid literary fantasies and his larger-than-life exploits swirled together for four decades, spinning off some 70 books and locating almost as many shipwrecks.
His work - mostly action thrillers of the James Bond-Indiana Jones kind, plus nonfiction accounts of his marine quests and a few children's books - made him a global celebrity.
His book sales have been staggering - more than 100 million copies, with vast numbers sold in paperback at airports. Translated into 40 or so languages, his books reached The New York Times' bestseller lists more than 20 times, as he amassed a fortune estimated at $80 million.
Often compared to the thrillers churned out by Tom Clancy, Robert Ludlum and Ian Fleming, the Cussler novels featured formulaic plots, one- or two-word titles and frequently a recurring hero, Dirk Pitt, an undersea explorer who cheats death and saves the world as he foils the diabolical plots of megalomaniac villains, while satisfying his taste for exotic cars and lusty women.
Cussler was hardly a stylist. Critics called his characters wooden, his dialogue leaden and his prose cliched ("the cold touch of fear," "a narrow brush with death"), while praising his descriptions of marine hardware, underwater struggles and salvage operations.
But readers were swept along on the page-turning tides, and after his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!" (1976), his books were frequently on the bestseller lists for months.
Cussler also connected with readers by turning his love for scuba diving into an oceanic lifestyle that paralleled and validated his superhero.
He first created the National Underwater and Marine Agency as a fictional government organization that employed his hero in the Dirk Pitt books. Then, in 1979, he founded an actual National Underwater and Marine Agency as a private nonprofit group committed to "preserving maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts." It underwrote his maritime ventures.
His first nonfiction book, "The Sea Hunters" (1996, with Craig Dirgo), was an account of his NUMA exploits, some of which were portrayed in television documentaries featuring Cussler as narrator. Valuable artifacts raised by his expeditions were given to museums or governments.
Cussler, who named his franchise hero after his son Dirk, acknowledged that Dirk Pitt's character was his own alter ego. His later novels, many co-written by his son or others, often included himself as a character who saves the day. His son, a daughter and friends were also used as characters in his books.
"I've been doing Dirk Pitt for 30 years," Cussler told the Times in 2000. "Maybe I can find another writer down the line to take him over. It's not the money; it's the fans.
"I'd like to retire," he continued. "I'm toying with the idea of Pitt having a son who shows up. He's getting a little long in the tooth. When we started out, we were both 36 years old. Now he's a little over 40, and I'm pushing 70."
But 20 years later, he was still churning out books, sometimes two a year. His "Journey of the Pharaohs: A Novel From the NUMA Files," written with Graham Brown, is scheduled to be published in March.

Texto completo: ROME - Two former schoolmates from California sat impassively in a courtroom Wednesday for the start of their trial for the murder of a plainclothes Italian policeman while they were vacationing in Rome last summer.
In pretrial court documents, prosecutors alleged that Finnegan Lee Elder, now 20, thrust a7-inch knife repeatedly into Carabiniere Vice Brigadier Mario Cerciello, while his friend, Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, now 19, scuffled with the officer's partner.
The jailed defendants have contended they didn't realize the officers were plainclothes police but mistook them for criminals following a thwarted cocaine sale hours earlier in a Rome nightlife district.
Just a row behind them was the widow of Cerciello, who was killed only days after he returned to duty from his honeymoon.
Elder, according to pretrial documents, admitted to the stabbing but said he acted in self-defense when he feared the burly Cerciello was strangling him.
Natale-Hjorth has also told authorities he acted in self-defense, alleging that he and his friend were assaulted by the police officers, so he scuffled with Cerciello's partner, Andrea Varriale. The partner suffered kicks and scratches, according to prosecutors.
According to judicial documents, Natale-Hjorth said he didn't know Elder had the knife. Prosecutors contend that after the stabbing, Natale-Hjorth hid the knife behind a ceiling panel in their hotel room.
Under Italian law, accomplices to an alleged murderer can also be charged with the murder itself. Italy's stiffest criminal punishment is life imprisonment.
Congress warns Pentagon not to shift funds for Trump wall
WASHINGTON - Lawmakers from both parties told Pentagon leaders on Wednesday that the Defense Department is undermining its own efforts to get military money by diverting billions of dollars for the construction of President Donald Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall
The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and the committee's top Republican warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper that overturning congressional funding decisions will have consequences.
Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, said that Congress may place greater restrictions on the Pentagon's ability to shift money to meet military needs.
The chairman, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., said: "The message it sends is the Pentagon has plenty of money," and "undercuts any arguments for any need for resources."
Trump campaign sues paper over 2019 opinion article
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump's reelection campaign sued The New York Times on Wednesday, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements claiming his 2016 election campaign had an agreement with Russia to exchange positive foreign policy for help defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton.
The suit, filed in New York State Court, alleges that The Times published a defamatory opinion piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign argues in the suit.
The Times published the piece because of its "extreme bias ... and animosity," the lawsuit said.
Spain cancels tenor Domingo's part in two opera dates in May
MADRID - Spain's Culture Ministry said Wednesday it canceled tenor Placido Domingo's participation in Madrid's La Zarzuela light opera theater in May, a day after the legendary singer said he accepted "full responsibility" for his actions that led to accusations of sexual misconduct.
It is the first time a performance by Domingo has been canceled in Europe since allegations surfaced of sexual misconduct by the singer.
The Culture Ministry's decision came a day after the U.S. union representing opera performers said its investigators found the opera star and former general director at Washington National Opera and Los Angeles Opera had behaved inappropriately over the course of two decades when he held senior management positions at the companies.
Lawsuit: Miss. prison has 'abhorrent conditions'
JACKSON, Miss. - The Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman is a violent, rat-infested place where inmates live in "abhorrent conditions" and their medical needs are routinely ignored, attorneys say in a new lawsuit filed on behalf of 152 prisoners
The suit was filed in federal court Tuesday, and attorneys are asking for class-action status to cover all current and future inmates at Parchman. It eventually could be merged with a similar lawsuit filed in January on behalf of 33 other Parchman inmates.
At least 19 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December, many from outbursts of violence at Parchman and other prisons.
The U.S. Justice Department announced on Feb. 5 that its civil rights division would investigate Parchman and other Mississippi prisons.
Court sides with Trump
in sanctuary grant fight
NEW YORK - The Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement grants to force states to cooperate with immigration enforcement, a federal appeals court in New York ruled Wednesday in a decision that conflicted with three other federal appeals courts.
The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned a lower court's decision ordering the administration to release funding to New York City and seven states - New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Virginia and Rhode Island.
Federal appeals courts in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have ruled against the U.S. government by upholding lower-court injunctions placed on the enforcement of some or all of the challenged conditions.
In Wyoming: Sharpshooters in a helicopter killed 36 mountain goats in a contested effort to eradicate the nonnative animals from Grand Teton National Park.
Four days after Interior Secretary David Bernhardt intervened to stop the shooting on the day it began, park officials released the tally Tuesday.
About 100 mountain goats, descendants of animals introduced outside the park decades ago, inhabit the Teton Range. Using a combination of shooters in the air and eventually on the ground, park officials say they want to eradicate the goats because they compete with bighorn sheep for food and habitat and can spread diseases including pneumonia to the native animals.

Hungry for intermittent fasting facts

Texto completo: I've long thought that the human body was not meant to run on empty, that fasting was done mainly for religious reasons or political protest. Otherwise we needed a reliably renewed source of fuel to function optimally, mentally, emotionally and physically.
But prompted by recent enthusiasm for fasting among people concerned about their health, weight or longevity, I looked into the evidence for possible benefits - and risks - of what researchers call intermittent fasting. Popular regimens range from ingesting few if any calories all day every other day or several times a week to fasting for 16 hours or more every day.
A man I know in his early 50s said he had lost 12 pounds in about two months on what he calls the 7-11 diet: He eats nothing from 7 p.m. until 11 a.m. the next day, every day.
I was skeptical, but it turns out there is something to be said for practicing a rather prolonged daily fast, preferably one lasting at least 16 hours. Mark P. Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explained that the liver stores glucose, which the body uses for energy before it turns to burning body fat.
"It takes 10 to 12 hours to use up the calories in the liver before a metabolic shift occurs to using stored fat," Mattson said. After meals, glucose is used for energy and fat is stored in fat tissue, but during fasts, once glucose is depleted, fat is broken down and used for energy.
Most people trying to lose weight should strive for 16 calorie-free hours, he said, adding that "the easiest way to do this is to stop eating by 8 p.m., skip breakfast the next morning and then eat again at noon the next day." (Caffeine-dependent people can have sugar-free black coffee or tea before lunch.) But don't expect to see results immediately; it can take up to four weeks to notice an effect, he said.
Mattson and his colleague at the aging institute Rafael de Cabo recently reviewed the effects of intermittent fasting on health, aging and disease in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Their article was prompted by frequent questions patients are asking their doctors about the health effects of fasting. Given their limited knowledge of nutrition, doctors are often unable to advise their patients, Mattson said.
Although a number of recent studies have assessed the effects of intermittent fasting on people, none are long term, and the vast majority of disease-related findings stem from research on laboratory animals. For example, in an animal model of stroke, those fed only intermittently suffered less brain damage because they were better able to resist the stress of oxygen and energy deprivation.
Other animal studies have shown a "robust disease-modifying" benefit of intermittent fasting on "a wide range of chronic disorders, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative brain diseases," the researchers reported. Their review of both animal and human studies found improvements in a variety of health indicators and a slowing or reversing of aging and disease processes.
For example, human studies of intermittent fasting found that it improved such disease indicators as insulin resistance, blood fat abnormalities, high blood pressure and inflammation, even independently of weight loss. In patients with multiple sclerosis, intermittent fasting reduced symptoms in just two months, a research team in Baltimore reported in 2018.
If you think evolutionarily, Mattson said, predators in the wild fight for prey in the fasting state and are better at recovering from injuries. The human counterpart - people who evolved in feast-or-famine environments - would not have survived unless somehow protected by fasting.
"Our human ancestors did not consume three regularly spaced large meals, plus snacks, every day, nor did they live a sedentary life," the researchers wrote. The studies they analyzed showed that "most if not all organ systems respond to intermittent fasting in ways that enable the organism to tolerate or overcome the challenge" and then return to normal.
Mattson explained that during a fast, the body produces few new proteins, prompting cells to take protein from nonessential sources, break them down and use the amino acids to make new proteins that are essential for survival. Then, after eating, a lot of new proteins are produced in the brain and elsewhere.
A reasonable question might be, "How safe is intermittent fasting?" When fats are used for energy, they produce substances called ketone bodies that "regulate the expression and activity of many proteins and molecules that are known to influence health and aging," the researchers reported. Ketosis, a buildup of acidic ketones in the blood, is a state that the Atkins diet, the ketogenic diet and other carbohydrate-restricted diets aim to achieve. Taken to extremes, however, ketosis can damage the liver, kidneys and brain and is especially dangerous to people with various chronic disorders like diabetes and heart disease.
Another important question is, "How practical is intermittent fasting?" Not very, especially in its early weeks or for people with limited control over their mealtimes.
"Many people will experience hunger, irritability and a reduced ability to concentrate during periods of food restrictions," the researchers wrote. They added, however, that these side effects usually disappear within a month.
How well this diet might work for you may depend largely on your usual pre-diet snacking and drinking habits and the kinds and amounts of foods you consume during the nonfasting hours. Knowing you cannot eat at all for a prescribed period may prompt some people to cram in whatever they want during the eating window, regardless of its nutritional value.
Mattson warned intermittent dieters to "eat healthy foods, including whole grains, healthy fats and protein, limit saturated fats and avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. And on fasting days, stay well-hydrated." He also suggested a gradual decrease over four months in the hours and days of restricted eating and in the amount of calories consumed on fasting days.

WICKED, Norfolk's most popular musical, will return to Chrysler Hall on May 20 - 31. Tickets for the return engagement go on sale March 13 at 10 a.m.
The Broadway sensation WICKED looks at what happened in the Land of Oz...but from a different angle. Long before Dorothy arrives, there is another young woman, born with emerald-green skin, who is smart, fiery, misunderstood, and possessing an extraordinary talent. When she meets a bubbly blonde who is exceptionally popular, their initial rivalry turns into the unlikeliest of friendships...until the world decides to call one "good," and the other one "wicked."
With a thrilling score that includes the hits "Defying Gravity," "Popular" and "For Good," WICKED has been hailed by The New York Times as "the defining musical of the decade," and by Time Magazine as "a magical Broadway musical with brains, heart, and courage."
Having recently celebrated its 16th anniversary on Broadway, WICKED is the winner of over 100 international awards including the Grammy Award and three Tony Awards. WICKED has been performed in over 100 cities in 16 countries around the world (U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, Germany, Holland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, The Philippines, Mexico, Brazil, Switzerland and China) and has thus far been translated into six languages: Japanese, German, Dutch, Spanish, Korean and Portuguese. WICKED has amassed nearly $5 billion in global sales and has been seen by over 60 million people worldwide.
Based on the novel by Gregory Maguire, WICKED has music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and a book by Winnie Holzman. The production is directed by Tony Award winner Joe Mantello with musical staging by Tony Award winner Wayne Cilento. WICKED is produced by Marc Platt, Universal Stage Productions, The Araca Group, Jon B. Platt and David Stone.
Tickets to Wicked go on sale March 13 at 10 a.m. and can be purchased at the Scope Arena Box Office and Ticketmaster.com. For more information, visit www.BroadwayNorfolk.com or www.SevenVenues.com.

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Federal prosecutors have charged five people tied to a neo-Nazi group with engaging in a campaign to intimidate and harass journalists and others, including a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, a university and a church.
The charges, announced Wednesday in Virginia and Washington state, are part of a broader recent crackdown by federal law enforcement on violent white supremacists in the United States. Authorities said the individuals were associated with the Atomwaffen Division, a small but violent paramilitary neo-Nazi group.
In the Virginia case, prosecutors accused John Cameron Denton, 26, whom they described as a former Atomwaffen leader, of harassment through a tactic known as "swatting" - calling police and falsely describing an imminent threat at a specific location, causing authorities to respond in force.
In one instance, prosecutors said, Denton targeted an investigative journalist at ProPublica because he was angry that the news organization had named him in its reporting on Atomwaffen.
In other cases in 2018 and 2019, prosecutors said, Denton and others placed swatting calls that targeted Old Dominion University, Alfred Street Baptist Church in Alexandria, Virginia, and an unnamed Cabinet official who authorities said was under Secret Service protection. Last month, prosecutors said, Denton met with an undercover FBI agent and described his efforts.
"Denton said that if he was 'raided' for swatting ProPublica, then it would be good for Atomwaffen Division because the swatting would be seen as a top-tier crime," Jonathan Myles Lund, an FBI agent, wrote in an affidavit. The affidavit named 134 law enforcement agencies that investigators believe received swatting calls from Denton and others.
Authorities said Denton operated with others, including two foreign nationals who live outside the United States, and another man, John William Kirby Kelley, who was arrested earlier and accused of playing a role in the swatting incidents. Kelley was a student at Old Dominion University.
In Seattle on Wednesday, prosecutors unsealed a conspiracy charge against Kaleb James Cole, 24, a leader of Atomwaffen's chapter in Washington, accusing him of sending threatening mail and cyberstalking. The others charged were Cameron Brandon Shea, 24, of Redmond, Washington, described as a high-level recruiter for the group; Taylor Ashley Parker-Dipeppe, 20, of Spring Hill, Florida; and Johnny Roman Garza, 20, of Queen Creek, Arizona.
Authorities said the quartet devised an operation called Erste Saule, or "first pillar" in German, which Shea described in an encrypted chat room as an effort to target "journalists houses and media buildings to send a clear message."
The goal, Shea said, was to "erode the media/states air of legitimacy by showing people that they have names and addresses, and hopefully embolden others to act."
Prosecutors said Cole and Shea were the "primary organizers." When members of Atomwaffen suggested Jewish or black journalists as possible targets, Shea and Cole offered praise. Shea said he wanted his victims to feel "terrorized." Cole suggested buying rag dolls and sticking knives through their heads and leaving them at the locations of their targets, according to the charges.
Authorities said Cole and Shea created posters that included Nazi symbols, threatening language and masked figures with guns and Molotov cocktails, then printed and delivered or mailed the posters to their targets.
Raymond Duda, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Seattle, said Atomwaffen surfaced on law enforcement's radar in 2018, and members have gone on to participate in military-style training camps and "hate camps." He said the FBI was continuing to investigate the group around the country.

Not all it's cracked up to be Streaming TV's boom is a mixed blessing for some Hollywood writers

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."

Texto completo: New Jersey chefs earned seven spots on the semi-finalist list for the The James Beard Foundation Awards, among the most prestigious culinary awards in the world.
The nominees include Marciel Presilla of Cucharamama in Hoboken (a 2012 winner of Best Chef-Mid Atlantic and 2013 winner of Cookbook of the Year), Joey Baldino of Zeppoli in Collingswood (this will be his ninth nomination), five-time nominee Dan Richer of Razza in Jersey City, Cookie Till of Steve and Cookie's in Margate, Robbie Felice of Viaggio Ristorante in Wayne, Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer of Canal House Station in Milford, as well as the restaurant 15 Fox Place in Jersey City.
The final round of nominees will be announced in Philadelphia on March 25 and the awards gala will take place on May 4 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.
Since the awards began in 1991, only two New Jersey chefs have received a James Beard award. Craig Shelton, then at The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse, and Maricel Presilla, chef at Cucharamama in Hoboken, both won best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. Shelton in 2000; Presilla in 2012.
Joey Baldino, Zeppoli, Collingswood Chef Joey Baldino, owner of Zeppoli, a Sicilian-influenced BYOB in Collingswood, has received his ninth James Beard nomination. It's the eighth time he's gotten the nod as Best Chef in the Mid-Atlantic Region, nominated every year he's qualified. Zeppoli also got a Best New Restaurant in 2012.
Prior to opening Zeppoli, Baldino worked with top chefs Georges Perrier, Michael Solomonov, Jose Garces, and Alice Waters early in his career. A graduate of the French Culinary Institute in New York City, Baldino also owns Palizzi Social Club, a private dining club in South Philadelphia, which Bon Appetit named the fourth-best restaurant in the country in 2017.
Last fall, Baldino released his first cookbook, "Dinner at the Club: 100 Years of Stories and Recipes from South Philly's Palizzi Social Club," written with long-time Courier-Post restaurant critic Adam Erace of Philadelphia. Before Christmas, Baldino cooked a traditional Feast of the Seven Fishes at the James Beard House in Manhattan.
Maricel Presilla, Cucharamama, Hoboken Maricel Presilla is a decorated chef and owner of Cucharamama and Zafra in Hoboken. A Latin and Caribbean cuisine expert, Presilla was named the James Beard Award's Best Chef-Mid Atlantic region in 2012, won the Foundation's Cookbook of the Year for "Gran Cocina Latina: The Food of Latin America" in 2013 and was inducted into its Who's Who of Food and Beverage in America in 2015. Her vibrant Latin restaurant Cucharamama has garnered her a 2020 nomination for Outstanding Chef, a national award.
Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer, Canal House Station, Milford It may only be Melissa Hamilton and Christopher Hirsheimer's first year owning and operating Canal House Station in Milford, a seasonal yet unfussy American restaurant that opened its doors last summer — but they're certainly no strangers to the culinary world.
The joint owners of Canal House, a publishing venture and culinary, photography and design studio known for their nationally recognized, seasonal cookbooks, "Canal House Cooking," have a storied history in the food world.
Hirsheimer is co-founder and former executive editor of Saveur, a gourmet, food, wine and travel magazine known for its essays about enduring culinary traditions. Throughout the magazine's 25-year-history, it brought home 23 James Beard Journalism Awards.
She is also an award-winning photographer whose work has appeared in more than 50 cookbooks for prominent food personalities such as Lidia Bastianich, Mario Batali and Julia Child.
Hamilton is the former test kitchen director and food editor of Saveur and has worked in the kitchens of Martha Stewart Living and Cook's Illustrated. She is also the co-founder and first executive chef of Hamilton's Grill Room in Lambertville.
Dan Richer, Razza, Jersey City Dan Richer opened his lauded BYOB pizza place Razza in 2012. Since then, folks from all over the state and beyond have flocked to Razza to try his Neapolitan-style wood-fired pizza. Razza received an impressive 3-star review from the New York Times.
Richer is an obsessive pizza maker, and has aced the creation of everything aspect of his pizza from the crust to the cheese on top. He has been nominated for Best Chef Mid-Atlantic.
15 Fox Place, Jersey City The homey 15 Fox Place in Jersey City was nominated for Outstanding Hospitality. This hidden gem is located in a 1905 home covered in vines on the outside and decorated with family photos on the inside. It's the childhood home of owner Marc Budinich. Dinner is served over a three-hour period with breaks built in so guests can mingle. There's no menu — guests simply sit in the cozy dining room and wait to be served their multi-course, Italian meal, just like at Nonna's house. The unique dining experience has made 15 Fox Place worthy of an Outstanding Hospitality.
Cookie Till, Steve & Cookie's and Ventnor No. 7311, Margate and Ventnor City Representing the South Jersey shore, Cookie Till, owner of Steve & Cookie's and Ventnor No. 7311, has been nominated for Outstanding Restaurateur. The bright and airy Steve & Cookie's is known for its upscale American and seafood-forward food. During the summer months, it's packed with locals and tourists alike – good luck getting a reservation. Her second restaurant, Ventnor No. 731, is a café and small batch bakery. This is where Till gets to flex her pastry skills, whipping up cookies, cakes, pies and loaves of bread.
Robbie Felice, Viaggio Ristorante in Wayne and Osteria Crescendo in Westwood In a telling sign of the food scene in the modern world, Felice found out about his Rising Star Chef nomination on — what else? — Instagram.
A friend messaged him a screen shot of the Beard web site with his name circled.
"I've been crying like a baby, running around, hugging all my line chefs," he said. "Everyone in the restaurant was screaming and jumping. It's been a morning, that's for sure."
Rising Star Chefs, according to the James Beard Foundation, "must be age 30 or younger and display an impressive talent, likely to make a significant impact on the industry for years to come." Felice is 29.
He started his career right after high school at the Culinary Institute of America, and his externship there was at Babbo in Manhattan. After graduation, he cooked at Highlawn Pavilion and The Manor, both in West Orange. He spent some time out west, in Vail, Colorado, and Las Vegas, where, at at B&B Ristorante, owned by Batali Bastianich Hospitality Group, he learned to cure his own meats.
After a culinary sojourn to Europe, he came back to the states and cooked at The Modern in Manhattan and Fascino in Montclair.
He and his father, Joe Felice, opened Viaggio in 2016, and Felice quickly became known for his modern — and delicious — Italian food, which he cooks using locally sourced ingredients. (The bolognese is to die for, as is the calamari in a lemon-butter sauce. And yes, he still cures his own meats.) The Record awarded the restaurant 3 1/2 stars, the highest ever for a restaurant in Passaic County.
They opened Osteria Crescendo in 2019, and in her review, Esther Davidowitz swooned over the farfalle, the crudo, the chitarra, well, everything.
Davidowitz called Felicie a "culinary superstar." Now, it appears the restaurant awards judges at the James Beard Foundation think so too.

Texto completo: Editor's note: The Enquirer Board of Contributors is a group of local citizens of different backgrounds and political philosophies selected by The Enquirer to write an op-ed once a month on a topic of their choosing.
I won the lottery!
Well, not really – but I feel as if I did.
You know the feeling – giddy, gushing with joy and ready to tell anyone and everyone the news.
That's how I feel today because I've been appointed to the Enquirer's Board of Contributors.
Little known fact: I'm a newspaper junkie.
As a kid growing up in Brooklyn, we had seven dailies – all delivered to our home. The Herald Tribune, New York Times, Daily News, Daily Mirror, New York Post, Brooklyn Eagle and Journal American.
Yikes – where have they gone?
What has happened to my beloved daily newspaper?
Work for the New York Post – the best sports section in the country – that's all I ever wanted to do.
And I did. I think it was like a submission hold in wrestling. They tapped out.
I wrote a letter-a-day to then Sports Editor Ike Gellis – and during my junior year in college he broke and called – I answered.
And worked as a clerk from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. – five days a week.
Wow – that sports department was like the New York Yankees "Murder's Row."
Larry Merchant and Dr. Z. – Paul Zimmerman – were the columnists. Maury Allen covered the Yankees and after the All-Star break switched to the Mets.
Steve Serby, who covers the NFL today was on the high school beat.
No computers back then – in fact, my job was to tape stories, then type and transcribe them.
No problem – a true labor of love.
I moved to the Brooklyn Graphic – a weekly – then to the Daily Eagle – and created a Scholastic Roundup notes column. It proved to be a hit in the borough that housed some 24 high schools.
I'd mention alums and where they may have continued their sporting careers – and, of course send the clips cross-country after they appeared in print.
A kid by the name of Arthur (Stretch) Graham played for Brooklyn's Lafayette High and continued at Oral Roberts University. I wrote about him and, of course, sent the story to Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Athletic Director Bob Brooks was impressed. He flew me to Tulsa, and I left newspapers to become the sports information man for the late Rev. Roberts' school.
Yes, I still love newspapers. I wake up to four dailies in my driveway – besides The Enquirer – the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and The New York Times.
My hopes are that those half my age will have their juices flow with newspapers as well.
And someday they too, will have the opportunity to write in this space.
Thank you.

ANCHOVIES IN STARRING ROLE Use them as starting point in pasta dish

Texto completo: Most anchovy pastas are minimalist things, born out of desperation with ingredients from the pantry. The assumption is that if you had anything else in the house, you'd surely cook that instead.
But true anchovy lovers beg to differ. For us, when anchovies are the starting point of a dish, they're also the star, making pasta so compelling that you won't want to relegate them to those nights when there's nothing in the fridge. You'll want to make them all the time.
I certainly do, loading anchovies into my pasta pot at least two or three times a month. (Actually, rare is the pasta that doesn't contain them.) I cook myriad variations, but the basic formula goes like this: Melt some anchovies and garlic into a pan of oil, then use that as the foundation for whatever sauce I want to build on.
In summer, there might be ripe tomatoes and herbs, or eggplant and peppers. In the fall, maybe mushrooms, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts. In winter, I like to use sturdy greens like broccoli raab, kale or spinach, which add vibrancy to the anchovies' umami funk.
In that last version, I also mix in some chopped cherry tomatoes for a little sweetness and color. Although I cook the anchovies and garlic in olive oil at the beginning of the dish, I stir in some butter at the end, which mellows the inherent bitterness of broccoli raab and rounds out the sauce.
A fat dollop of ricotta gives the pasta some creaminess, which I always crave when the weather gets cold, but it's not at all essential. And, while I love the saline tang of the capers, you can skip them if they are just one ingredient too many. With all those anchovies in the pan, you probably won't even miss them.
About those anchovies, for a dish like this, you need to get the good ones. I think the reason so many people are anti-anchovy is that there are a lot of bad, fishy ones on the market. Look for those packed in olive oil, and sample different brands until you find one you like. Then, stock up. After all, a pantry filled with anchovies is the beginning of many amazing future meals - no matter what other ingredients you have in the house.
See recipe: Pasta with garlicky anchovies and broccoli raab, D3
Pasta with garlicky anchovies and broccoli raab
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 30 minutes
Kosher salt
12 ounces short pasta, such as shells, wagon wheels or rigatoni
2 packed cups parsley, leaves and tender stems
10 anchovy fillets, preferably packed in olive oil (one 2-ounce tin)
1 small bunch scallions, white and green parts, chopped
2 tablespoons capers, drained (optional)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced to a paste
1 (1-pound) bunch broccoli raab, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (plum, cherry or grape work well)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Pinch of red-pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
Ricotta, for serving (optional)
1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions until 1 minute shy of al dente. Use a coffee cup or measuring cup to save some pasta water, then drain pasta.
2. While the pasta cooks, coarsely chop the parsley, six anchovy fillets, scallions, capers (if using) and a pinch of salt. You can chop it all together on a cutting board, or pulse everything briefly together in the food processor; just make sure to keep it coarse.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium. Add oil, remaining four anchovies and half the garlic, and let cook, stirring, until anchovies start to dissolve, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in broccoli raab, tomato, about two-thirds of the parsley mixture and a pinch of salt to the pan. Sauté until the raab is tender, 5 to 8 minutes, adding splashes of pasta water as the pan dries out. Taste and season with more salt if necessary.
5. Add pasta to pan along with butter, lemon zest, remaining garlic and red-pepper flakes. Toss until the butter melts and the pasta is combined with the vegetables, adding more pasta water if the mixture seems dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Divide pasta among bowls and sprinkle with remaining parsley mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with ricotta, if you like.

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - To many in the eastern Delhi neighborhood where a convulsion of religious violence erupted this week, it all began with one man.
Kapil Mishra, a local politician with India's leading Hindu nationalist party, had just lost an election. Acquaintances in the area, which now feels like a war zone, said he had been looking for a way to bounce back.
Mishra, 39, is known for his outspoken views and flexible politics. As an upper caste Hindu from a political family, he had worked for Amnesty International and Greenpeace, and risen in the ranks of one of India's most progressive political organizations.
But several years ago he shifted allegiance across the political spectrum to the Bharatiya Janata Party, India's current governing party, which has deep roots in Hindu supremacist ideology.
On Sunday, he appeared at a rally against a group of protesters (most of them women) who were objecting to a new citizenship law widely seen as discriminatory toward Muslims. There he vented his anger in a fiery speech in which he issued an ultimatum to police: Either clear out the demonstrators, who were blocking a main road, or he and his followers would do it themselves.
Within hours, the worst Hindu-Muslim violence in India in years was exploding. Gangs of Hindus and Muslims fought each other with swords and bats, shops burst into flames, chunks of bricks sailed through the air, and mobs rained blows on cornered men.
"Kapil Mishra should be in jail," said Rupesh Bathla, a businessman who says he has known Mishra since they were teenagers. "He started communal riots. He planted hatred in other people's hearts."
By Wednesday, at least 24 people had died, hospital officials said, most from gunshot wounds. Several witnesses said the live fire came from the direction of the police officers, and the dead included Hindus as well as Muslims.
Though property belonging to Hindus was burned, the destruction was much heavier on the Muslim side.
In Muslim areas, shop after shop was destroyed and entire markets were burned down. Dozens of Muslim residents have accused police officers of standing passively by while the destruction was underway.
With the violence cooling down for the moment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who hosted President Donald Trump as the fighting raged, broke his silence Wednesday after Trump had departed, urging people in a Twitter post to "maintain peace and brotherhood at all times." He added: "Peace and harmony are central to our ethos."
But concerns lingered among many Indians, including Hindus, that Mishra and his Hindu nationalist supporters have weaponized a very dangerous mood.
Protests against the new citizenship law, which makes it easier for non-Muslim migrants to become full-fledged Indian citizens, have flared intermittently since December. But this past week was the first time the protests turned large numbers of Hindus and Muslims violently against one another.

Texto completo: Atari. Magnavox. Intellivision.
Each evokes memories of the golden age of video games, which brought the first wave of consoles you could connect to your home television.
But there's an oft-forgotten person from that era whose contributions to the industry still resonate today: a black engineer named Jerry Lawson.
Lawson oversaw the creation of the Channel F, the first video game console with interchangeable game cartridges – something the first Atari and Magnavox Odyssey systems did not use.
Those initial consoles had a selection of games hardwired into the console itself. (The Magnavox Odyssey, released in 1972, also used game "cards," that were printed circuit boards, but did not contain game data as the subsequent cartridges did. )
But Lawson, an engineer and designer at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp. , led a team at the Silicon Valley semiconductor maker charged with creating a game system using Fairchild's F8 microprocessor and storing games on cartridges.
Black History Month essay: I searched a continent a world away, hoping to find 'home'
Women's suffrage: These 19 black women fought for voting rights
"A lot of people in the industry swore that a microprocessor couldn’t be used in video games and I knew better," Lawson said during a speech at the 2005 Classic Gaming Expo in San Francisco posted on YouTube.
The Fairchild Video Entertainment System, later named the Channel F (for "Fun"), which began selling in 1976, had games such as hockey, tennis, blackjack and a maze game that foreshadowed Pac-Man.
Before Atari, there was Channel F
The console beat the Atari 2600 to market by one year. But Atari's name recognition and marketing heft basically pushed the Channel F into video game history obscurity. The system would sell about 250,000 units while the Atari 2600, which would get hits such as "Space Invaders" and "Asteroids," would go on to sell about 30 million units.
Regardless, the Channel F established the concept of a console that could play an unlimited number of games, the foundation for today's global video game market, which is projected to surpass $160 billion in 2020, according to research firm Newzoo.
Lawson, who died in 2011 at the age of 70 due to complications of diabetes, "literally created an industry that is bigger than the movie industry," said John William Templeton, executive producer of curriculum and content for ReUNION: Education-Arts-Heritage, which creates programming for schools.
How Lawson got into games
A groundbreaker as one of the few African American engineers in the industry at the time, Lawson grew up in Queens, New York. He was a lifelong inventor who attended college but did not earn a college degree, according to his obituary in The New York Times. As a teen, he made money by repairing televisions.
After he moved to the Bay Area and was working at Fairchild, Lawson belonged to a home inventors club that included Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak; the pair would go on to found Apple. Lawson also built his own coin-operated arcade game called "Demolition Derby" in his garage, which led the company to ask him to focus on games, according to an interview in 2009 with Vintage Computing and Gaming.
When he left Fairchild, Lawson founded his own video game company, Videosoft, which created games for the Atari 2600 and made some of the first 3D games. But he closed the company during the video game crash of the mid-1980s.
Lawson got some recognition before he died. He was included in the 2009 documentary, "Freedom Riders of the Cutting Edge," produced by Templeton, who had served as editor of the San Jose Business Journal from 1987 to 1989.
Soon after that, Templeton mentioned Lawson to Joseph Saulter, chairman of the International Game Developers Association's diversity advisory board. "I just said to him, 'Well, you know the person who did the first video game console was black. ' He just literally stopped in his tracks," Templeton said. "I just interviewed him I can bring him over and have him speak to folks. "
As a result, Lawson was invited to a Blacks in Gaming gathering at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco in 2011. "The most important part of it was that there were maybe 70 or so black developers there listening to him," Templeton said. "It was just extremely emotional for them because for their entire lives, their professional lives, they had been feeling like outsiders and, then they (could say), 'Hey, wait a minute, somebody who looks like me started the whole thing'. "
Gordon Bellamy, who at the time was the IGDA's executive director, recalled how the event helped younger African Americans working in video games embrace "our reality, to learn and value and celebrate the very history of how our careers were built on (Lawson's legacy)," he said.
In the early '90s, Bellamy was one of the few African Americans working in video games and he rose to become a lead designer on Electronic Arts' John Madden Football franchise. "We are a continuation of a history," said Bellamy, who seven years later got an IGDA lifetime achievement award named after Lawson.
Meeting Lawson, he said, "was great and obviously for me resonant. I think for him it was his first time seeing his legacy live on not only in the recognition of his work but in all of us existing in the craft. "
"As I reflect on it, I was an engineer myself coming out of school," said Bellamy, who is currently a visiting scholar at the University of Southern California and president of Gay Gaming Professionals. "I am just so thankful for his contributions that afforded me my career. "
His place in video game history
An exhibit of Lawson's handiwork is on permanent display at The World Video Game Hall of Fame at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. There, you can see the Channel F game system and some of Videosoft's games. The museum has Lawson's papers in its archive, too. Lawson and the Channel F game system are also included in "A History of Video Games in 64 Objects," a book published by the museum in 2018.
Among the museum's missions: bringing to light the contributions of minorities and women in the video game industry. Lawson's contributions counter a lack of representation of black game developers in the industry, said Jeremy Saucier, an assistant vice president for interpretation and electronic games at the museum.
"The major figures often tend to be white men," Saucier said. "We really want to get the history right and tell a more inclusive history than the meta-narrative that we have stuck with in the past. "
It's not you, it's them: Google, Alexa and Siri may answer even if you haven't called
Move aside, Google Maps and Apple Maps: Why people still love their paper maps
The creation of the Channel F system by Lawsons's team at Fairchild was "an achievement (that) ends up completely changing what was at the time a really burgeoning video game industry," he said. "It laid that groundwork for the business model of the industry, the razor blade model, of (putting) a console in the hand of consumers for a low profit or loss and make much higher profits on all these individual games. "
Violence in today's video games
As he aged, Lawson became upset with how video games glorified violence. "Most of the games that are out now – I’m appalled by them," he told Vintage Computing and Gaming. "They’re all scenario games considered with shooting somebody and killing somebody. To me, a game should be something like a skill you should develop – if you play this game, you walk away with something of value. That’s what a game is to me. "
Lawson's story is told almost daily still. Templeton co-produced (with William Hammons II) another documentary, "A Great Day in Gaming: the Gerald Anderson Lawson Story" in 2011 and it is shown in schools that participate in the ReUNION network.
As he works with children in Brooklyn and Queens, Templeton says he often evokes Lawson's career, "as an example of how they can be creators and not just consumers. "

Texto completo: As fears spread throughout the world that the coronavirus will become a full-fledged pandemic, it was only a matter of time before shockwaves reached South Florida's mighty cruise industry.
On Tuesday, it happened.
The Miami-based MSC Meraviglia, sailing in the western Caribbean, was denied permission to disembark passengers for planned port calls in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands because of concerns that one of the ship's crew members could be infected.
MSC Cruise, in a statement, pointed out that those fears were unfounded.
MSC said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision not to allow the ship to disembark in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, which came after the ship was left in limbo for several hours while Jamaican authorities reviewed detailed medical records submitted ahead of the ship's arrival.
Authorities in Grand Cayman, the cruise line said, refused the ship's planned Wednesday morning debarkation at its Georgetown port "without even reviewing the ship's medical records." Those records, the statement continued, showed a single case of "common seasonal flu [type A influenza] affecting a crew member who had not traveled through territories affected by the coronavirus or subject to any international health restrictions.
"In both cases, the ship was effectively turned away simply based on fears," the statement said, adding that the crew member and all passengers on the ship passed mandatory health screenings in Miami before the cruise set sail on Sunday.
The crew member had traveled to Miami from Manila, in The Philippines, with a stop in Istanbul. He was isolated from other crew members and guests and given anti-viral treatment and medication. He is now free of fever and nearly recovered.
But Jamaica's Ministry of Health released a statement defending the decision, calling The Philippines "a country of interest" for the coronavirus and pointing out that the crew member "had a cough, fever and associated muscle pains."
The Cayman Islands' refusal was out of "an abundance of caution, in order to provide protection to the health and safety of the residents of the Cayman Islands," according to a statement by the islands' health minister published in a New York Times report.
After the refusals, the cruise line said in a statement that it was conferring with health officials at the ship's next scheduled port in Cozumel, Mexico "to ensure that their decision will be based on a factual review of the ship's medical records, as well as consideration for the pre-embarkation screening and onboard medical and deep sanitation protocols that are in place across MSC Cruises' entire fleet."
Late Wednesday afternoon, MSC Cruises announced it had received authorization to dock in Cozumel later in the evening.
The denials followed a pattern set by Holland America's MS Westerdam, which was turned away from five countries whose authorities feared that people onboard might have the coronavirus.
After the Westerdam was allowed to dock in Cambodia, a single passenger tested positive for the virus, but the Centers for Disease Control later said the diagnosis was "a false positive," according to the New York Times.
Concerns about catching the virus from cruise ship passengers and crew members were heightened as the world followed the sad plight of Princess Cruises' Japan-based Diamond Princess, which was quarantined after 10 passengers tested positive.
During the quarantine, the number of cases increased to at least 705, including 42 Americans. Four infected passengers have died.

WARREN'S DUBIOUS APPROACH TO EDUCATION THE MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR HAS MADE A MISGUIDED DEFENSE OF THE TEACHERS UNION MONOPOLY

Texto completo: ERIE, Pa.
Two women - one black and not affluent; one white, wealthy and famous - are contrasting faces of America's debate about equal educational opportunity in grades K-12.
Porschia Anderson, a mother with daughters in kindergarten, fourth and 10th grades here, and parents like her have an enormous stake in Pennsylvania expanding charter schools and supporting other avenues to educational choices. The aim of such measures is for parents of modest, or negligible, means to have alternatives that affluent parents take for granted.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren is ardent for equality as an abstraction but is even more ardent for the support of public school teachers unions. They are tenacious in defense of their semimonopoly in primary and secondary education: Less than 6% of the nation's pupils are in charter schools, and only 218,000 (0.39%) of the 56.6 million pupils received vouchers.
In Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, there is a wearying constant, a simmering conflict. On one side are parents seeking charter schools - public schools granted more administrative and instruction discretion than enjoyed by unionized public schools. These parents also seek tax credits for privately funded scholarships that low-income families can use to pay tuition at private schools. On the other side are teachers unions characterizing such programs as "attacks" on public education funding.
Some attacks: Nationwide per pupil public expenditure (in constant dollars) doubled between 1960 and 1980, and doubled again by 2016. Ms. Warren's and Sen. Bernie Sanders' jeremiads against "greed" exempt that of teachers unions.
The Commonwealth Foundation is a tireless advocate for more Pennsylvania charter schools and for tax credits for scholarships. This school year the foundation, prevailing against labor's big battalions, expanded scholarship access to 15,000 more children. Unfortunately, Gov. Tom Wolf, who attended a prestigious and pricey prep school, The Hill School, has issued executive actions to restrict enrollments in charter schools. And to cut funding for charters. And to force charters to pay the government to perform its duty of compelling reluctant school districts to obey the law: Pandering to teachers unions, some districts refuse to provide charters with legally required per pupil funding. Charter funds are distributed by school districts that often are running the underperforming schools that make parents desperate for the alternative of charter schools.
Last year, Philadelphia, where 34,000 students recently applied for 7,500 available charter spaces, refused all three applications for new charters. Demand does not elicit supply when monopolists use politics to restrict supply.
A 2019 Education Next poll showed African American majorities favoring public charters and private school vouchers for low-income families. Nevertheless, Ms. Warren pledges to "end federal funding for the expansion of charter schools" and "ban for-profit charter schools." She who preens about her granular mastery of policy details must know that her pledge would have a disparate impact on low-income and minority families. Mr. Sanders, too, vows to ban for-profit charters (about 12% of charters) and to freeze funding for new charters.
Before the Supreme Court's 1954 school desegregation decision, state and local governments could tell African Americans where they could not send their children. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren would have the federal government do that. George Wallace's ghost is smirking.
Last November, Ms. Warren spoke in Atlanta with some African Americans who had interrupted her speech to protest her opposition to school choice, and who accused her of sending her children to private schools. Ms. Warren replied, as a clever lawyer would, "No, my children went to public schools." This was technically true and (unless her son's schooling slipped her mind) tendentious. She has tweeted "#PublicSchoolProud" and her daughter attended public schools. So did her son, until he didn't. After fifth grade, he attended private schools in Austin and in Haverford, Pa. The public schools that Ms. Warren's children did attend probably did not resemble those from which parents seek relief when residing in, as is delicately said, challenging urban environments.
The following is pretty much what Porschia Anderson believes: "[T]he term 'voucher' has become a dirty word in many educational circles. . The fear is that partial-subsidy vouchers provide a boost so that better-off parents can opt out of a failing public school system, while other children are left behind. . [But] a taxpayer funded voucher that paid the entire cost of educating a child (not just a partial subsidy) would open a range of opportunities to all children."
Those are not, however, Ms. Anderson's words. They are from the 2003 iteration of Elizabeth Warren. She also has celebrated the "extraordinary results" of Massachusetts charters, some of which started with the sort of federal aid she now vows to abolish.

Texto completo: NATIONAL BRIEFS
NEW YORK - President Donald Trump escalated his war against the press by suing the New York Times Co., accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements claiming his 2016 election campaign had an agreement with Russia to exchange positive foreign policy for help defeating his rival, Hillary Clinton.
The suit, filed in New York state court Wednesday, alleges that the Times published a defamatory opinion piece in March 2019 that claimed the campaign had an "overarching deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin's oligarchy to swap assistance in the race against Ms. Clinton for relief from economic sanctions imposed by Barack Obama's administration.
The campaign says the piece refers to the meetings between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump officials in 2016, which it says ended in no agreement.
"The Times was well aware when it published these statements that they were not true," the campaign argues in the suit. "The Times' own previous reporting had confirmed the falsity of these statements."
NONPROFIT SAYS IT WILL OPEN INJECTION SITE
PHILADELPHIA - A Philadelphia nonprofit group detailed plans Wednesday to open next week what would be the nation's first medically supervised injection site to combat overdose deaths, despite outrage from neighbors and opposition from the local federal prosecutor.
The announcement came after a federal judge who oversaw months of litigation ruled Tuesday that the Safehouse plan wouldn't violate federal drug laws because it aims to reduce drug use, not encourage it.
The decision to open the first site in residential south Philadelphia, and not the Kensington neighborhood north of downtown that has become the epicenter of the city's opioid problem, took many by surprise. At a heated news conference Wednesday, neighbors complained that the site selected has a day care center in the building, and schools, stores and restaurants nearby.
"We will monitor this," said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Safehouse board member.
WHISTLEBLOWER IN MICHIGAN SEX ABUSE CASE TO SPEAK
ANN ARBOR, Mich. - An attorney announced Wednesday that his firm represents more than a dozen people in the University of Michigan sexual abuse case and will hold a news conference with the whistleblower and two other former wrestlers to share their allegations about the late Dr. Robert E. Anderson.
"On Thursday, different victims will be able to come forward and request that the University of Michigan accepts accountability for decades upon decades of these allegations," lawyer Parker Stinar with Denver-based Wahlberg, Woodruff, Nimmo&Sloane told The Associated Press.
Mr. Stinar said a former Wolverines wrestler from the 1970s will be among the speakers. The man, who Mr. Stinar didn't identify, will read parts of a letter he has kept that detail his previous complaints about Anderson and correspondence he received from the university, Mr. Stinar said.
Also scheduled to speak at the news conference are the whistleblower, who hasn't yet been identified, and former Olympic and Michigan wrestler Andy Hrovat, the first athlete to publicly say Anderson touched him inappropriately.

MODERN COOKING VIETNAMESE: Vietnamese cuisine made easy: Chef Nicole Routhier, part of team behind Le Colonial in Atlanta, shares some recipes.

Texto completo: Nicole Routhier may not be a very familiar name in current culinary circles. But the French Vietnamesechef, cookbookauthor, and teacher has long been considered an authority on Vietnamese cuisine.And since 1993, Routhier has had a hand in developing menus for multiple Le Colonial restaurants, including the new location at the Shops Buckhead Atlanta.
Routhier grew up in Saigon, where her mother was a cook, and studied in Belgium and France, before moving to New York City, and then Houston, where she lives now. When I met her during the opening of Le Colonial in Atlanta last year, she noted that Vietnamese food wasn't well known in the U.S. when she wrote her first cookbook.
"I was way ahead of the curve, 30 years ago,"Routhier said. "That was at the time when there were barely any cookbooks on Vietnamese cuisine. There was nobody teaching people how to cook Vietnamese food at home. I said, 'I'm going to be the one,' because I was so passionate about it, and this is a cuisine that people should know about. So I just wrote what I knew, the food I grew up with, and I just happened to make a career out of cooking."
Routhier graduated from the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, New York, in 1985. And shortly before that, then-New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne wrote an effusive story about Routhier's cooking, with the headline "The flavors of Vietnam re-created in America."
Routhier's "The Foods of Vietnam" was published in 1989, and won the Julia Child Award for Best American Cookbook from the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Two more acclaimed cookbooks followed: 1994's "Cooking Under Wraps" and 1996's "Nicole Routhier's Fruit Cookbook."
Recently, I asked Routhier if she would consider sharing some of her recipes for home cooks. She not only said yes, but traveled to Atlanta, whereshepreparedseveral dishes in the Le Colonial kitchen.
Then we sat down in the dining room to taste and talk about each one, including a Spicy and Sour Shrimp Soup with Pineapple, Salmon Braised in Ginger Caramel Sauce served with pickled vegetables, and a favorite Banana Tapioca Pudding.
"I don't really create anything from scratch, because I prefer to work from heirloom and classic dishes,"Routhier said. "The Spicy and Sour Shrimp Soup is not something that I invented, but the flavors are to my taste. This dish is from South Vietnam, where they have pineapple plantations, and they are so sweet. And I chose to use okra because I know people in Georgia love it, and we love okra in Vietnam, too."
Speaking about the salmon dish, Routhier said, "Braised fish is very old and classic. It's something that my mother made almost every other day. It's a go-to dish for most homecooks, becauseyoucanmake a large amount and reheat it. I prefer fish, but my mother would cut pieces of chicken or pork or sometimes pork ribs. The marinade is very unique. You make a caramel with brown sugar and then you add fish sauce to it. The sauce is sweet and salty, so you need to balance it with something sour or acidic like pickled vegetables."
Banana Tapioca Pudding is another dish from Routhier's childhood memories, but she put her own spin on it when she developed the recipe.
"As a child, this was my favorite dessert," she said. "We have street vendors, and each one of them specializes in one specific dish. In the afternoon, after I came back from school, it was our tea time, and I would eagerly await the chants of the vendors with the banana pudding. Mine is very basic. It's tapioca, coconut milk, sugar and bananas cooked up together. But what goes after makes it special. We serve it with toasted sesame seeds, for a little crunch, and I elevated it a little bit by caramelizing the bananas."
Routhierhasbeenteachingcookingclassesforyears, andknowsthat tackling Vietnamese cuisine can be intimidating for many people.
"My job is to make it less intimidating," she said. "But I insist on having hands-on classes, because that's the only way that people can learn how the textures work, how fresh the ingredients are, and how things taste together. My first job is to help them understand the ingredients, where to find them, and give them options when they can't find certain ingredients. Vietnamese cuisine made easy for the home cook is how I approach it."

Texto completo: Rose, known for representing high-profile players such as Carmelo Anthony, is expected to assume the new role on March 1 in a bid to revitalize a struggling franchise.

Leon Rose, a prominent player agent, will take over as the Knicks' team president on Sunday, according to two people familiar with the timetable.
Rose verbally agreed to take the job in early February and spent the rest of the month detaching himself from the various players he represents for Creative Artists Agency, according to the people, who spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.
The Knicks have not yet formally announced Rose's hiring and may not do so until next week since Rose's first day -- March 1 -- falls on a weekend. Steve Mills, Rose's predecessor, was reassigned to a new role within the Madison Square Garden Company on Feb. 4, two days before the N.B.A.'s annual trade deadline.
Leaguewide reaction to Rose's appointment has been measured, thanks in part to the widespread expectation that James L. Dolan, the Knicks' owner, was finally going to pursue a highly experienced lead voice for the front office, such as the Toronto Raptors' Masai Ujiri.
Rose is a respected and well-connected figure in the game after representing some top players in more than two decades as an agent, including Allen Iverson, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and, more recently, Chris Paul, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker and Karl-Anthony Towns. But he has no front-office experience and joins an organization with only six playoff appearances since losing to the San Antonio Spurs in the N.B.A. finals in 1999.
Rose faces a busy first few months in the job, with the Knicks headed for their seventh successive losing season and without a permanent head coach.
The Knicks were 17-40 entering their game on Wednesday night at Charlotte, 13-22 under their interim coach, Mike Miller, which represents a notable improvement on the 4-18 start that led to David Fizdale's firing on Dec. 6. Rose is nonetheless expected to hire an experienced replacement for Miller at season's end, with Tom Thibodeau, the former Chicago and Minnesota coach, often mentioned in league coaching circles as a likely target.
Of course, if the Knicks hire Thibodeau, a longtime C.A.A. client, it will only amplify the perception that the franchise has punctuated years of ceding considerable influence to Rose's former agency by turning to him to run their basketball operations.
Rival teams and agents have long questioned the Knicks for allowing C.A.A. to hold significant sway over team decisions, dating to Anthony's arrival from Denver by a trade in February 2011.
It is not yet clear if General Manager Scott Perry, who ran the team's dealings at the trade deadline after Mills was moved out, will retain a role under Rose.
The Knicks also recently hired the longtime music executive Steve Stoute as a branding consultant. On Feb. 11, after Stoute said during an ESPN television appearance that he would have "a loud voice" in the Knicks' future and made a coaching change sound imminent, team officials issued a statement saying he "does not speak on behalf of New York Knicks personnel and basketball operations."
The Knicks are surely hoping that Rose can find success on the team side as quickly as have two fellow former agents, Bob Myers (Warriors) and Rob Pelinka (Lakers).
In neither case, though, has the team flourished by signing the executives' former clients. There are also recent examples of prominent agents, most notably Lon Babby in Phoenix and Arn Tellem in Detroit, whose arrivals made no tangible impact on their new teams.
When news of Rose's pending hire broke on Feb. 6 -- trade deadline day -- Dolan issued a statement saying: "I am not selling, but I am determined to find the right leader for the Knicks who will ensure the long-term success of the team."

Barr Calls News Media 'Monolithic In Viewpoint'

Texto completo: The attorney general, speaking at a religious broadcasters convention, said Christian news organizations were a vital check on a mainstream press that had become too powerful.
WASHINGTON -- In a wide-ranging speech on the importance of Christianity in public life, Attorney General William P. Barr said on Wednesday that religious news publications and broadcasters were essential checks on a mainstream media that has consolidated far too much power.
Mr. Barr, speaking at the National Religious Broadcasters annual convention in Nashville, called the mainstream press "remarkably monolithic in viewpoint" and said that "an increasing number of journalists see themselves less as objective reporters of the facts and more as agents of change."
"We live at a time when religion -- long an essential pillar of our society -- is being driven from the public square," said Mr. Barr, a devoted Catholic. "Thank God we have the National Religious Broadcasters to counter that effort."
Mr. Barr's criticism came on the same day that President Trump sued The New York Times for libel over an opinion piece that asserted that his campaign "had an overarching deal" with Russia during the 2016 election.
His speech also echoed other robust defenses of Christianity in politics and education that he has delivered during his first year as attorney general. In October, he said that "the forces of secularism" had unleashed "immense suffering, wreckage and misery" as they sought to destroy religious life in America.
Under his leadership, the Justice Department supported parents in Maine who sued in an effort to force the state to include religious schools in its tuition-funding program. And the department applauded a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the Trump administration's ability to deprive clinics that provide abortion referrals of federal funds.
Former Justice Department officials and lawyers have publicly criticized Mr. Barr's remarks about the role of religion in America, and current department employees have quietly grumbled about them. But his unapologetic calls for more faith in public life have made him a hero of the religious right, which has long hoped that the federal government would steer the country away from cultural changes like secularism and greater acceptance of L.G.B.T. people.
The ardent criticism and praise that Mr. Barr has garnered also makes him indicative of the deep divide between those who see religion as a core American value and the heart of the country's democracy and those who believe that placing religion at the center of law enforcement, policymaking and politics violates the nation's tenet to separate church from state.
"Moral values must be based on authority independent of man's will. In other words, they must flow from a transcendent Supreme Being," Mr. Barr said on Wednesday. "Men are far likelier to obey rules that come from God than to abide by the abstract outcome of an ad hoc utilitarian calculus."
Mr. Barr said that Christian news organizations had shown that the press could serve higher ends, including "the safeguarding of faith as well as the cultivation of the classical virtues of the mind and heart" -- values that he said were essential to preventing American democracy from unraveling.
By contrast, Mr. Barr said that the mainstream news media now had an "unprecedented ability to mobilize a broad segment of the public on a national scale," a power that he said jeopardized the press's ability to be a check on "the tyranny of the majority."
Mr. Barr also argued that the separation of church and state did not require the wholesale repudiation of religion from the public square, and he denounced the creation of a national "culture of disbelief."
He reiterated past assertions that progressive institutions were trying to undermine organized religion, and said that the nation's move away from the church had made politics more polarized.
Mr. Barr did not discuss the support that Mr. Trump has among evangelical Christian groups, who have made his re-election a top priority.
While many Christian groups have backed the president, the magazine Christianity Today created an uproar among Christians when it published an op-ed article that supported his impeachment and removal from office. Evangelical leaders attacked the magazine for expressing that opinion.
He also did not discuss the extreme, politically polarizing positions that some Christian groups have taken on issues such as abortion, which have led to public altercations with women seeking abortions and sometimes lethal attacks on the doctors who provide them.

Caucus Mistakes and Inconsistencies, This Time in Nevada

Texto completo: The final results of the Nevada Democratic caucuses were released on Monday, and the data appears to contain errors and inconsistencies similar to those that plagued the contests in Iowa a few weeks ago.
An analysis by The New York Times found flaws in the results of at least 9 percent of precincts, including some instances in which delegates appeared to have been given to the wrong candidates.
Like Iowa, the state party in Nevada released raw vote totals for its more than 2,000 precincts for the first time this year, allowing the public to check the math that determines which candidates get the delegates they need to win the Democratic nomination.
Shortly after the final caucus results were released, the Nevada State Democratic Party chairman, William McCurdy, said in a statement that the state should consider abandoning caucuses.
"I believe we need to start having a serious conversation ahead of next cycle about the limitations of the caucus process and the rules around it," Mr. McCurdy said. "It's time for our state party and elected leaders to look at shifting to a primary process moving forward."
Here are some examples of the errors uncovered in the analysis.
Vote counts are inconsistent:
120 precincts The Nevada caucuses took place over two rounds of voting, and candidates had to meet a certain threshold of votes to reach viability and win delegates.
A common error was an increase in the vote totals in the second round of voting. In most cases, this was an increase of only a handful of votes, but some precincts recorded a large jump.
The vote totals matter for calculating viability. In the precinct above, total attendance recorded for the first alignment was 91, which would mean a viability threshold of 14. But the total attendance for the second alignment was recorded as 149, which would make the viability threshold 23. It's hard to say which of the two counts is correct.
Nevada allowed early voting for the first time this year, and the volunteers who ran the caucuses were told to count early voters in each precinct as if they were present. This error could be the result of confusion about how to record the preferences of the early voters, or it could be a simple data entry mistake.
Candidates without enough supporters won delegates: 21 precincts Candidates had to meet the viability threshold again in the final round of voting to win delegates. But in some cases, nonviable candidates ended up winning delegates.
In this example, from a precinct in Washoe County, the minimum votes required for viability was 14. There were only 13 supporters in the group for the billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, but he still received two delegates.
Caucusgoers who chose Mr. Steyer should have had to make another choice, or to persuade members of other nonviable groups to join them. But since they did not, it's impossible to know which candidate they might have chosen or how those choices would have changed the results.
Delegates calculated improperly:
At least 43 precincts The share of votes a candidate wins determines how many delegates they get. Caucus rules instruct volunteers to round up or down to the nearest whole number if necessary when awarding delegates. The process becomes more complicated if the rounding does not work out cleanly, and at many precincts, volunteers appear to have been tripped up by the rounding rules. But some fumbled even the most straightforward delegate math.
This precinct in Nye County had 10 delegates to award. Senator Amy Klobuchar got 20 percent of the votes, which means she should have received two delegates. Instead, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was awarded two more delegates than he should have been, and Ms. Klobuchar received none.
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont declared victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday with a sizable lead, and it does not appear that the errors in the results were large enough to have changed that outcome. Mr. Buttigieg, who trailed Mr. Biden in third place, called on the party to review inconsistencies in 200 precincts.
Methodology: The Times analyzed the most recent caucus results released by the Nevada State Democratic Party on Feb. 24. Nevada has a total of 2,097 precincts, and 1,736 precincts had registered Democrats ahead of Caucus Day, according to the state party. The error rate was calculated using the total precinct count.
The analysis checked for precincts that awarded delegates to candidates who were not viable, those that inaccurately calculated delegate math, those that awarded fewer delegates than they were allotted and those that had more votes in the final round than in the first.
The Times used the party's caucus guide and training materials for guidance on caucus rules. We did not examine caucuses with only one county delegate to award because those contests follow different rules.
The number of votes needed for viability for each precinct was calculated based on total votes in the first round.
The part of our analysis looking at delegate math was conducted on a subset of precincts in which it was possible to make the calculations. That analysis did not include situations in which a tiebreaker may have been necessary to award delegates.

Trump Team Plans Centers For Courting Black Voters

Texto completo: The centers will register voters, sell campaign merchandise and promote policies that have benefited African-Americans, the campaign said.
WASHINGTON -- In its latest attempt to win over African-American voters, President Trump's 2020 campaign said Wednesday it would lease 15 retail properties in predominantly black neighborhoods across swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania, where it will build welcoming "community centers" that sell merchandise, register voters and spread the word about Trump policies that have helped black communities.
On Wednesday afternoon, senior Trump campaign officials offered reporters a tour through a mock-up storefront it built inside its campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va.
Hoodies bearing the slogan "WOKE" were on display for sale in the mock community center. A large television screen played a stream of testimonials from black voters talking about why they supported Mr. Trump. Posters featuring smiling African-American supporters highlighted the administration's work overhauling the criminal justice system, its funding of historically black colleges and universities, and the country's unemployment rate, the lowest in 50 years.
Colorful pamphlets advertised Mr. Trump as "a builder of communities and the American Dream," and a rendering showed a possible exterior design for a center inside of what looked like a mall.
The centers, which will be about the size of a small storefront, are planned for Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami, Fla.; Atlanta, Ga.; Detroit, Mich.; Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pa.; Charlotte, Raleigh and Greensboro, N.C.; and Milwaukee, Wis.
"It's a woke concept," said Katrina Pierson, a senior campaign adviser. "For decades you have had a community that has been controlled by the Democratic Party. Republicans haven't even gone in to deliver their message."
Mr. Trump won just 8 percent of African-American voters in the 2016 election. Senior campaign officials said they are spending millions of dollars on the new retail spaces in order to increase his support among black voters. Trump advisers say they do not need to increase his support significantly to make a difference in a handful of critical battleground states in November.
The plan is the latest outreach from the Trump campaign to court African-Americans. Trump advisers often point to unemployment data as his main selling point.
But even some Trump advisers concede that the president's team has tactics but not a strategy when it comes to appealing to black voters, many of whom have recoiled from his rhetoric and some of his policies, such as cuts to social safety net programs.
"He clearly is very desperate for black support," said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a progressive group. "This is not something we've ever seen before, in terms of opening offices in black communities. There is a reality that we know that some black voters are going to vote for Trump."
The outreach is not guaranteed to help the president. Ms. Shropshire said that a recent internal poll conducted by her organization showed that about one-third of respondents had been contacted in some way by the Trump campaign. But, she said, "the majority of folks in our survey said the contact made them less likely to vote for Trump."
Part of the disconnect, she said, was that the message about a surging economy and low unemployment rate was at odds with many people's lived experience of holding multiple jobs but still struggling to be financially stable.
And then there's the elephant in the room when it comes to Mr. Trump and black support. "A number of our polls and other national polls show that black voters simply think he's a racist," Ms. Shropshire said. "You can show up, but most people believe you're a racist and that you fundamentally don't have the interests of black people at heart."
Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, however, said all of the outreach has already increased support.
"At a minimum, we're double where we were in 2016," he said on Wednesday.
Later, the Republican National Committee said it was funding the outreach centers, which officials said would help Republicans up and down the ballot. Senior campaign officials said they were also considering opening Latinos for Trump offices down the line.

Texto completo: The state still has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, but it has set in motion preparations and funding to deal with an expected influx of cases.
ALBANY, N.Y. -- Reacting to concerns about the quickening spread of coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that the state would set aside some $ 40 million to fight the virus, as well as plan for possible quarantines at homes, hotels and hospitals.
In a briefing in the Capitol, the governor and his health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, stressed that New York still had no confirmed cases of the virus, but warned that its spread to the state was inevitable.
The scope of the virus's spread and the importance of New York as a center of global commerce and transportation led Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, to ask for additional funding for fighting the disease.
"It is highly probable that we will have people in New York State who test positive," said Mr. Cuomo, noting that New York City is "the front door internationally" for many travelers. "No one should be surprised when we have positive cases."
In addition to the $ 40 million from the Legislature, Mr. Cuomo said he would ask federal authorities permission to test patient samples in a laboratory in New York, rather than waiting several days for results from the C.D.C. in Atlanta.
The virus has killed more than 2,000 people in China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The total number of cases globally has now reached 80,980 and nearly 3,000 have died.
The state's actions came a day after federal health officials asserted that the virus, which causes respiratory problems in patients, was likely to spread in the United States, where a few dozen cases have been confirmed so far, including more than 40 from a cruise ship.
State officials have already been taking precautions against the disease, asking some 700 recent visitors to China to voluntarily quarantine themselves, even as Customs and Border Protection agents continue to screen passengers at area airports. Individuals who have visited mainland China are judged to be of "medium risk," according to the State Health Department, though it said none of those self-isolating individuals had exhibited symptoms of coronavirus.
In New York City, where officials say seven potential patients have been tested and cleared, Mayor Bill de Blasio has expressed confidence that the city is prepared, citing previous scares involving even more deadly diseases like Ebola in 2014.
"We are in a state of high vigilance, high readiness, all elements of the city government, to address this crisis," he said at a news conference on Wednesday. "We have the greatest public health capacity of anywhere in this country."
The city has made 1,200 hospital beds available for anyone suspected of having coronavirus and has distributed 1.5 million face masks to health care workers.
But the mayor warned that the city needed help from the federal government in obtaining more protective gear -- at least 300,000 more masks, he said -- and stressed the importance of giving local health departments the ability to test for the virus on their own.
Other major cities were also taking precautions, including San Francisco, which declared a local state of emergency on Tuesday, despite no confirmed cases, saying "the global picture is changing rapidly."
Confirmed cases have now been reported in more than 40 countries.
On Wednesday, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said they were working with state and federal health officials to assess potential contingency plans.
Those measures could include limiting or staggering public transit ridership, according to a document prepared by City Hall and the New York City's Emergency Management Department in 2014 that focused on how the city might respond to a flu pandemic.
"We take this issue very seriously, and are following the C.D.C.'s lead while we further monitor the situation," said Patrick Warren, chief safety officer at the M.T.A. "In the meantime, we encourage everyone to take the standard precautions they would during any flu season."
Speaking at a news conference, Patrick J. Foye, chairman of the M.T.A., said the authority had increased its own supply of masks and other materials in preparation for an outbreak but did not offer details on the contingency plans being discussed.
The authority has also posted thousands of signs on subways and buses encouraging riders to wash their hands and avoid close contact with sick people.
Similarly, state health officials were regularly consulting with the C.D.C. as well as county officials, and studying federal recommendations for mitigation in case of a large outbreak, including basic precautions such as covering one's face when sneezing or coughing, to more expansive measures such as school closures and cancellation of public events.
"If you prepare correctly, you'll have less of an issue when a situation develops into something that is more problematic," Mr. Cuomo said. "The threat you don't take seriously is the one that becomes serious."

Texto completo: Can drinks, community events and the occasional wedding subsidize small-town journalism?
MARFA, Texas -- When Landrie Moore was looking for a venue for her destination wedding, she knew she wanted a space that really reflected life in this small, remote desert town.
Her guests would be coming from as far as Ecuador and England, and Ms. Moore, 35, who works for a boutique hotel firm, hoped to provide a memorable and authentic experience for those travelers. When you visit a new place, she said in a phone interview, "you want to feel like a local."
Which is why she decided to get married mere feet from the office of The Big Bend Sentinel, the region's oldest newspaper (where I worked as a reporter in 2014 and 2015).
Ms. Moore's wedding, in June, was the first of five held last year in the Sentinel, a cafe and cocktail bar in the newspaper's newly renovated office building. The space is perhaps the most visible sign that The Big Bend Sentinel is under new ownership: Maisie Crow and Max Kabat, who moved to Marfa from New York City in 2016, took over last year from Robert and Rosario Halpern, the paper's publishers of 25 years.
"We kind of saw us in a way," Mr. Halpern said of the couple.
"Buy a newspaper?" Mr. Kabat, 37, recalled thinking when the Halperns first approached him and Ms. Crow about a potential sale. "What are we, idiots?" Their background is in consulting and documentary filmmaking. (The New York Times is a producer of a forthcoming film by Ms. Crow.)
Since 2004, nearly 20 percent of local papers in the United States have folded or merged, according to a 2018 study by the Hussman School of Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina. In many cases, publishers have been replaced by a narrow network of large investment groups that have acquired hundreds of failing newspapers.
But Marfa is no ordinary town, and its newsweekly has been a pillar of the community for nearly a century -- long before Marfa became cool. The Big Bend Sentinel's pages are pasted up with major issues of the day (the death of Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court justice, on a nearby luxury ranch, for example, and the possibility of a border wall just 60 miles away) alongside valedictorian announcements, photo spreads of homecoming events and advance coverage of the town's many festivals.
Before Mr. Kabat and Ms. Crow (who is originally from Corpus Christi, Tex.) took over, the paper ran solely on ad sales and subscriptions. "It was able to sustain itself on a shoestring, but we wanted to expand the potential," Ms. Crow, 38, said. They hoped to bring locals closer, physically, to the institution covering their hometown.
So they bought the building previously occupied by Padre's, a dive bar that went out of business in 2016, and before that, a funeral home, and began renovations.
"We had to sage the whole place," said Callie Jenschke, whom the couple hired to handle interior design.
She recognized that there was a familiar Marfa aesthetic that tourists had come to want and expect -- "a nomadic austerity mixed with the warmth of the desert," in her words -- and married that with Scandinavian influences, including concrete floors and Hans Wegner chairs, while preserving the original adobe brick and plaster walled facade.
All the furniture had to be movable and multifunctional, Ms. Jenschke said, "because they didn't really know how it was going to be used." It could be a co-working space, Mr. Kabat and Ms. Crow thought initially, then decided a subscription model would go against their goal of inclusivity.
Instead, they landed on a cafe/bar where locals could work and tourists could recharge. They would rent the kitchen space to local cooks to serve food throughout the day. And though they wouldn't make money off the food itself, they could turn a profit on drinks. Eventually, there would be requests to rent the space for private events.
On a visit in the fall, the morning crowd lined up for coffee, served in hand-thrown clay mugs and with the option of organic oat milk. By early afternoon, the bar offered watermelon ranch waters for happy hour. Newspapers were scattered on the surfaces of the space.
Next door, the Big Bend Sentinel's staff squeezed into a dimly lit room just a fraction of the Sentinel's size. Now and then, the two full-time reporters dropped into the cafe to refill their mugs.
A relic of the old office remains: a neon sign spelling out "newspaper." In the evenings, when the light is turned on, the office glows red from within.
Sometimes the reporters work out of the Sentinel, which functions as a kind of public square. "It's a great way to keep my finger on the pulse and get new leads and find stories," said Abbie Perrault, 27, the managing editor.
For legal reasons, Ms. Crow and Mr. Kabat have decided to keep the businesses separate on paper. In Texas, any business with a Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission license for serving alcohol is subject to warrantless searches by law enforcement, and they didn't want to take that risk with the newsroom.
Still, the couple sees the Sentinel as a natural extension of the paper. During editorial meetings, the staff discusses greenlighting private events. When a political candidate asked to rent the space to host a meet-and-greet, they declined, concerned it might violate the ethics of the newspaper.
Since Ms. Crow and Mr. Kabat took over, they have expanded the newspaper's digital platform, which has seen a 7 percent increase in traffic, Mr. Kabat said, and broadened its photographic coverage. At the newspaper's sister publication, The International, which the couple also owns and which serves the largely Spanish-speaking neighboring border town of Presidio, every article is now translated into Spanish. They added a crossword puzzle and Sudoku to both papers, too.
The newspapers still sell ads, which account for the majority of revenue. But with additional income from private events and day-to-day drink sales, the publishers have been able to keep yearly subscription costs steady: $ 50 for area residents and $ 60 for anyone outside.
"If people come in and buy a coffee and buy something from our shop, rent the space, buy a cocktail, whatever it is, their dollar isn't just going to that," Ms. Crow said. "Their dollar is going to support something larger."

If Virus Strikes Tokyo, What Are the Options?

Texto completo: The I.O.C. and the organizers in Tokyo have alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer in Japan. They just aren't very appealing.
In his two decades as a consultant to organizations vying to host the Olympic Games, Terrence Burns helped write and review official bids and plans from dozens of potential candidate cities.
In all those bids, he said, discussions of potential disruptions to the event were fairly narrow in scope: mostly natural disasters, like earthquakes or fires, and, more recently, terrorist attacks.
"I've never seen an Olympic organizing committee asked, 'Are you prepared for a global pandemic?"' Burns said this week.
Now, with just under five months to go before the scheduled opening of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo on July 24, organizers in Japan and at the International Olympic Committee headquarters in Switzerland are grappling with the coronavirus outbreak, which is threatening to derail the world's largest sporting event.
In preparing for the Olympics, Japan's public health planning until now had focused on the prevention of measles and rubella, sexually transmitted diseases and food poisoning. A new disease, like the coronavirus, was not central to their calculations.
Still, as the virus has begun to spread through the country, officials in Japan have played down suggestions that plans for the Games could be altered or even canceled. At a news briefing on Wednesday, the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said that preparations for the Games were proceeding "as planned," adding that the Olympic torch would begin its journey to Japan in March according to schedule.
The I.O.C. has also declined to entertain the possibility that the Games might not take place exactly as planned.
But sporting events in Japan and elsewhere are already being canceled, as governments try to discourage large gatherings in major cities.
Many who have procured tickets and made travel plans are now wondering whether they will have to scrap them.
"We've had our first guests calling to ask questions about canceling," Anbritt Stengele, the president of Sports Traveler, a travel agency specializing in packages to international sporting events, said this week. "Everyone in the industry is monitoring it and concerned."
People across the Olympic world have begun to ponder, then, what might happen if the coronavirus has not been brought under control before the summer.
"I'm sure somewhere within the walls of the I.O.C. headquarters there's a big board with various scenarios on it where people are thinking about, 'OK, what do we do in a worst-case situation?" said Dick Pound, a longtime I.O.C. member.
There are options, of course, according to people like Burns who have worked with the Olympics for decades. None are very appealing.
Moving the Games
One theoretical solution involves moving the Olympics to a different locale -- perhaps a city that has recently hosted the Games, like London, or one that might be gearing up to, like Los Angeles.
It has happened with other major sports events. The 2003 Women's World Cup was relocated from China to the United States during the outbreak of SARS.
But the Women's World Cup, particularly back then, was a considerably smaller event in scope than the Olympics, with far fewer traveling fans, athletes, sponsors and media members. And in general, stadiums that can accommodate soccer, the world's most popular sport, are easy to find. Venues that can host surfing, sailing, equestrian dressage and track cycling? Less so.
Olympic host cities block out rooms in countless hotels. They reserve high-profile venues, generate public safety and transportation plans, and deal with a host of other logistical and legal issues years in advance, in anticipation of tens of thousands of visitors.
"Who could put on an event the size and scope of the Olympic Games even beginning today, five months out?" Pound said. "Nobody, realistically."
There is also the question of whether it would even make sense amid a viral epidemic to have thousands of people from around the world congregate in another city and then return to their homes.
Yasuyuki Kato, professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare in Narita, Japan, noted that the Games could act as "a hub to disseminate the virus to other countries."
Canceling the Games
The Olympics have been canceled outright three times -- in 1916, 1940 and 1944 -- during the world wars.
The prospect of a cancellation now, when so many parties have invested billions of dollars and years of labor -- and have legal contracts -- seems almost unthinkable.
Broadcasters have carved out huge programming blocks, and marketers have built campaigns meant to culminate in Tokyo. Athletes have trained for years to appear on that stage.
"I'll tell you who definitely doesn't want to cancel is NBC," said Jules Boykoff, a professor of politics and an expert on Olympic history at Pacific University in Oregon. "They have put billions into the rights to these Olympics. There will be serious disgruntlement from those who have power. They will insist that the Games go on."
A spokesman for NBC said, "The safety of our employees is always our top priority, but there is no impact on our preparations at this time."
The spread of viruses can be suppressed in warmer months, and Melissa Nolan, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of South Carolina, said "most predictions estimate we'll see a major decline by July."
But Pound said he believed any decision to cancel or modify the Games would have to be initiated by late May.
Asked about Pound's comments, Suga, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said they were "not the official view of the I.O.C." And the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, responding to questions from The New York Times, said that it was "not considering canceling."
Postponing the Games
In 2001, days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, organizers of the Ryder Cup, a team golf competition between the United States and Europe that was historically staged in odd-numbered years, decided to postpone the event for 12 months after top golfers like Tiger Woods expressed concern about flying. To accommodate the change, the Presidents Cup, a team golf competition that had been staged in even-numbered years, was also pushed back a year, to 2003.
A similar but more complicated sort of rejiggering would be required if the Olympics were to be postponed by a few months or a full year.
Pushing the Games to the summer of 2021 would put them in direct conflict with world championship events in several sports, which would most likely have to be moved as well.
Holding the Games just a few months later would put them in direct competition with a host of other professional sports competitions that would not move to accommodate them. For example, while N.B.A. basketball players are available in July, they are not available in October.
In addition, NBC is busy with football in the fall, while its summer programming is largely dedicated to the Olympics. "Olympic parties don't want to host Olympic Games in the middle of the N.F.L. football season for obvious financial reasons," Burns said.
Athletes Only
With few good options, organizers could be forced to get creative.
One way to satisfy broadcasters could be to hold the events behind closed doors, a nod to the reality that most fans watch the Games on television. But it's unclear whether public safety concerns would be addressed if thousands of athletes, coaches and staff members from around the world were still congregating in competition venues.
Or could the Olympics go on in Tokyo as planned -- with, perhaps, travel from certain countries barred, screening zones in every venue and public space, and plenty of hand sanitizer and masks on hand?
At some point, though, such an event might not feel like the Olympics, which is supposed to be a peaceful celebration of people from more than 200 countries. Can the Olympics be the Olympics without majestic opening and closing ceremonies in packed stadiums, or if events are spread out across multiple cities?
The questions may grow louder as the virus spreads further.
"It's unusual, it's unprecedented, it's a complex issue," Burns said, "and if something indeed happens, it will have a complex solution."

Re "Making Gender Pronouns Stick on Campus" (news article, Feb. 20):
As a professor, I am surprised that another professor "finds it strange that [students] would want to announce their gender during the first class of the semester, before telling him anything else about themselves."
"Why is this the first thing we know?" he asks.
Isn't the answer obvious? To address students properly, professors need to know right away what to call them.
But I question the suggestion that professors "introduce themselves by their pronouns on the first day of class, as a kind of bonding exercise." I use students' preferred pronouns as a matter of respect, but I'm not trying to bond with students. I'm trying to teach them philosophy and critical thinking!

Texto completo: In 1979 his firm came up with the New York City subway map that is the basis for the one still used.
Michael Hertz, whose design firm produced one of the most consulted maps in human history, the curvy-lined chart that New York City subway riders peer at over one another's shoulders to figure out which stop they want, died on Feb. 18 in East Meadow, N.Y. He was 87.
His son Eugene announced the death, at Nassau University Medical Center, but did not give a cause. Mr. Hertz also lived in East Meadow, on Long Island.
In the mid-1970s the Metropolitan Transportation Authority gave Mr. Hertz's firm, Michael Hertz Associates, the task of coming up with a map of the New York City subway system that would help riders make sense of that many-tentacled beast.
There was already a system map (or "diagram," as some preferred to call it), a colorful Modernist thing created by the Italian designer Massimo Vignelli and introduced in 1972. It was fun to look at -- the Museum of Modern Art in New York has that version in its collection -- but few users loved it, in part because the Vignelli map didn't relate the underground to the aboveground.
"It was the 1970s," Arline L. Bronzaft, a psychologist who worked on Mr. Hertz's replacement map, told Newsday in 2004. "People were fearful of going on the subways. We wanted people to use the map to see the sights of New York."
The map that Mr. Hertz's firm came up with included streets, neighborhoods and other surface reference points. And it depicted the city and its signature elements like Central Park and the waterways in a fashion more reflective of reality -- the park wasn't square, as on the earlier map, and the water wasn't beige.
The new map was a group effort. An M.T.A. committee led by John Tauranac studied various designs and gathered input. A Japanese painter and designer working for Mr. Hertz, Nobuyuki Siraisi, rode every subway line with his eyes closed so that he could better feel the curves in the routes. (One of the complaints about the Vignelli diagram was that it was done entirely in straight lines.)
There has been some sniping over the years as to who deserves credit for the 1979 map, with Mr. Hertz taking exception whenever Mr. Tauranac was identified as "chief designer" or given some similar title.
"We've had parallel careers," Mr. Hertz told The New York Times in 2012. "I design subway maps, and he claims to design subway maps."
In 2004, the Long Island newspaper Newsday asked Tom Kelly, then the spokesman for the M.T.A., about who did what.
"The best thing I could probably tell you is to quote my sainted mother: 'Success has many fathers,"' Mr. Kelly said. "That's not to disparage any work that anybody else put into the map. But, in all honesty, it's Mike Hertz that did all the basic design and implementation of it. In all fairness, the father of this map, as far as we're concerned, is Mike Hertz."
One thing is certain: The map he and his team came up with had staying power. It has been tweaked, updated and amended over the years. A substantial redesign was done by Mr. Hertz in 1998. But the core concept developed in 1979 remains.
"In transit map circles, Mike was a giant," Charles Gordanier, the M.T.A. official who oversees the map today, said by email. "All New Yorkers carry some image of Mike's subway map in their heads."
Michael Edward Hertz was born on Aug. 1, 1932, in Brooklyn to Abraham and Jean (Gittleman) Hertz. He grew up in Brooklyn and Queens and earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from Queens College in 1954, then spent two years in the Army.
He worked for the Walt Disney Company as art director for movie advertising for a decade before starting his own firm in the late 1960s. He worked on transit maps for Houston and Washington, maps of New York City's various neighborhoods, airport maps and directories, and more.
In addition to his son Eugene, Mr. Hertz is survived by his wife, Carole Ann (Ruden) Hertz, whom he married in 1954; two other sons, David and Joseph; a daughter, Leslie B. Kawaler; and eight grandchildren.
For the M.T.A. map, he told the news website Gothamist in 2007, the team started out handcuffed.
"Perhaps the biggest constraint was that it had to fit into the existing map frames in every subway car," Mr. Hertz said. Since the city is taller and narrower than Vignelli had made it, he added, the team had to "knead, bend and squeeze the map to fit in the already existing frame."
A breakthrough, he said, was the idea that a bit of distortion could be introduced.
"We realized that we could nip and tuck smaller areas of the city to give more space to congested areas like Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn without major damage to the overall sense of the city's geography," he said.
The team tested preliminary designs on actual subway users. The result, Mr. Hertz believed, did the job nicely. "It continues to be the right balance between information and graphic clarity," he told The Times in 2010.
He especially wanted the map to be understandable to tourists and other first-time users.
He told The Times in 2004, "I still get a pleasure in a subway station when I see somebody in lederhosen looking at the map."

Texto completo: "Please don't surrender the tradition of daily editorials by the editorial board," a reader writes.
To the Editor:
I was not happy to find a giant hole in my newspaper on Wednesday. Please don't surrender the tradition of daily editorials by the editorial board.
If the editorial board is overworked, lacks ideas or needs more time to report on issues, give it the resources it needs. Maybe you can lighten its load by adding more people to the board.
I was put off by the editors' note (print edition, editorial page, Feb. 26) explaining the changes. It's absurd to think that readers want to hear from the board only on "matters of great significance." Yikes! That makes the board sound so special.
I thought that the board was made up of talented journalists who worked hard and earned a coveted spot at the newspaper. I value the collective opinion of the editorial board. I want to hear from the editorial board every day on all manner of topics.

Texto completo: As the world grapples with the coronavirus outbreak, these works remind us that humans have faced deadly plagues for millenniums.
If you're looking for context, history or scientific information about the spread of disease, these books are a good place to start.
AIDS
'And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic,' by Randy Shilts
As Shilts writes in the prologue of his award-winning 1987 book: "The story of these first five years of AIDS in America is a drama of national failure, played out against a backdrop of needless death." He called out local and federal governments, scientists, the news media, politicians and leaders in the gay community, adding: "It is a tale that bears telling, so that it will never happen again, to any people, anywhere."
CHOLERA
'The Ghost Map: The Story of London's Most Terrifying Epidemic -- and How It Changed Science, Cities, and the Modern World,' by Steven Johnson
In August 1854, many poor Londoners "suddenly took sick and began dying. Their symptoms included upset stomach, vomiting, gut cramps, diarrhea and racking thirst. Whatever the cause, it was fast -- fast to kill (sometimes within 12 hours of onset) and fast in spreading to new victims," David Quammen wrote in his review of this fascinating and detailed account of the city's worst cholera epidemic. "Seventy fatalities occurred in a 24-hour period, most within five square blocks, and hundreds more people were in danger."
EBOLA
'The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus,' by Richard Preston
"The scenes in 'The Hot Zone,' a riveting new nonfiction thriller by Richard Preston, will remind you of things you've seen in the movies," Michiko Kakutani wrote in her 1994 review. "The scary part is that these scenes aren't the invention of an imaginative screenwriter or novelist. They're the product of months of reporting by the New Yorker contributor Richard Preston, who set out to tell the story of the deadly new viruses that appear to be emerging from Africa's rain forests, and the men and women who are trying to contain them before they can spread, like AIDS, into the human population at large."
INFLUENZA
'Flu: The Story Of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It,' by Gina Kolata
"In the autumn of 1918, when the war in Europe was almost over, a terrible plague came upon the earth. People called it the Spanish flu, but its innocuous name did not stop it killing twice as many as the Great War itself," David Papineau wrote in his review of this book by Kolata, a medical reporter at The Times. "In the United States alone, half a million perished that winter, gasping for breath as the infection squeezed life from their lungs." Could such a deadly influenza return in this day and age? "Flu" is about the scientists who worry about such a possibility, and as Kolata explains, they "remain very nervous indeed."
MALARIA
'The Fever: How Malaria Has Ruled Humankind for 500,000 Years,' by Sonia Shah
"Sonia Shah's tour-de-force history of malaria will convince you that the real soundtrack to our collective fate ... is the syncopated whine-slap, whine-slap of man and mosquito duking it out over the eons," Abigail Zuger wrote in The Times.
THE PLAGUE
'A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century,' by Barbara Tuchman
In her award-winning 1978 narrative, Tuchman argued that many of the disruptive forces at work in the 14th century -- war, religious schisms, the plague -- played out again during the 20th century (hence the book's title).
SMALLPOX
'Pox Americana: The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82,' by Elizabeth A. Fenn
"The American Revolution coincided with a smallpox plague that swept across North America, decimating the population and determining the course of history," the paper's reviewer, Janet Maslin, wrote. "From the nature of the many references on which Ms. Fenn's lively research draws, it's clear that the epidemic has generally been regarded as a footnote to the full story of the Revolutionary War. ... Not this time: Ms. Fenn's entire focus is on the disease, how it spread and where its larger importance lies."

Microsoft Adds Its Warning To Rising Alarm Over Virus

Texto completo: The tech giant said the virus was causing issues with its supply chain, about a week after Apple said it was facing similar problems.
SEATTLE -- Microsoft on Wednesday said its sales in the current quarter would be lower than it had previously predicted because of coronavirus-related disruptions in Chinese manufacturing.
While its fast-growing cloud computing business is not affected, the company said its personal computing business, which includes Windows installations and its Surface laptops and tablets, would record lower sales than it told investors to expect last month.
"Although we see strong Windows demand in line with our expectations, the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated," the company said in a statement.
Roughly a week ago, Apple warned it was cutting sales projections because of the public health crisis from the coronavirus.
Apple said the factories that make its iPhones were slower to reopen after the Lunar New Year than it had expected, and the company experienced lower demand for its products from Chinese consumers. At the time, all of its stores in China were closed, though some have since begun to reopen.
The financial warnings from Microsoft and Apple -- two of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world -- underscore the vulnerability of technology supply chains in China, said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. Many tech companies in the United States rely on large factories in China, though some have started to shift to other countries like Vietnam.
"When bellwethers like Microsoft come out and talk about the supply chain and how it will negatively impact PC demand, it fans the flames of some of the worries out there for the broader supply chain," he said.
Microsoft's stock fell about 1 percent in after-market trading on Wednesday evening.
Personal computing, which includes hardware sales as well as Windows installed on computers that other companies produce and sell, accounts for roughly a third of Microsoft's revenue.
In January, the company said it expected to have between $ 10.75 billion and $ 11.15 billion in sales for the segment, a wider-than-normal range reflecting the uncertainty at the time. The company did not provide a new sales estimate.
Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not sell much in China, and the market accounts for less than 2 percent of the company's revenue. While its Windows and Office products are used in China, the software is often pirated.
Having two giants disclose that the coronavirus is squeezing their finances will put pressure on competitors to follow suit, said David Larcker, a professor of corporate governance at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

When companies make unusual financial disclosures, they need to juggle their duty to inform shareholders, their desire to get ahead of a big surprise and the need to keep some information secret from competitors, he said.
"It may be they are still trying to understand this," Mr. Larcker said. "It may not be a satisfying answer, but it's a truthful one."

Texto completo: Readers react to the raucous debate on Tuesday night.
To the Editor:
Re "Sanders Under Fire at Raucous Debate" (front page, Feb. 26):
As a lifelong Democrat, I have never been more disappointed and embarrassed for my party than I was on Tuesday night watching the fiasco that was the most recent Democratic presidential debate.
I believe that any one of the seven candidates would make a far better president than Donald Trump, but all I saw were seven little Trump copies acting like undisciplined and entitled children -- just like Mr. Trump.
To borrow a phrase from the civil rights movement, these candidates need to "keep their eyes on the prize." They all, along with all Democrats and patriotic Americans, need to commit to the prize, which is ridding our country of the most destructive and disastrous president we have ever known, Donald Trump. Failure in this is not an option.
Who won the Democratic debate? None of us.
Tom Garey
Santa Barbara, Calif.
To the Editor:
Re "The Democratic Party Devours Itself" (column, nytimes.com, Feb. 26):
To Frank Bruni's fear of divisiveness and rancor among the Democratic presidential candidates, I say, "Have at it!"
Soldiers don't train for war by playing patty-cake. Nor should we think that Donald Trump will play nice or be too dumb to use Bernie Sanders's words and record against him.
And most important, Democrats must never follow the Republican example of sacrificing morals, principles and reason to obey their leader.
I share the concerns Pete Buttigieg raised about Senator Sanders and applaud Mr. Buttigieg for voicing them. Humans aren't sheep. We can -- and should -- question, challenge and oppose any political leader who would take us in the wrong direction.
Bernie Sanders is no more a Democrat than Donald Trump is a Republican. Unlike the Republican Party establishment, Democrats should be unafraid to say so.
Jay Markowitz
Pound Ridge, N.Y.
To the Editor:
In Tuesday night's debate, the candidates, with the possible exceptions of Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden, conducted themselves poorly, interrupting, not answering direct questions, speaking longer than the time they were allowed and even refusing to stop when prompted by the moderators.
Sadly, in recent years, this behavior seems to have become the norm in political debates, frequently making it difficult for the TV audience to understand what is being said.
Perhaps if the moderators had mute buttons enabling them to put a muzzle on the offenders, it would make for a less chaotic event.
Joan Berglund
Orient, N.Y.
To the Editor:
On Tuesday night, Pete Buttigieg said Bernie Sanders has "nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s." What's wrong with that?
The 1960s saw the adoption of Medicare, the Voting Rights Act and laws intended to help achieve equality among the races. It also saw an increase in the standard of living for millions of Americans.
Maybe another social revolution is exactly what we need to put the United States back on the right track.

Texto completo: The Los Angeles police said that intruders took some things from the home, but that some usual signs of a robbery were absent. There have been no arrests.
The rapper Pop Smoke had been out that night, returning late to the four-bedroom Spanish-style house where he was staying in the Hollywood Hills. Around 4 a.m., soon after he came home, the police said, four men in hoodies broke in and shot him twice. A bullet to the torso left the promising 20-year-old musician dead.
A week after his death, the Los Angeles Police Department is trying to untangle whether Pop Smoke, whose real name was Bashar Jackson, was the victim of a random robbery or if he was targeted, perhaps because of what he was posting on social media. There have been no arrests.
In the weeks before his death, Pop Smoke had posted pictures on Instagram showing him next to or holding large stacks of cash. One such picture was posted the day before he died. He also posted about a gift bag he had received, in which the address of the Hollywood Hills home was clearly visible.
"It's an angle we're looking at," Capt. Jonathan L. Tippet said of Pop Smoke's Instagram posts. "It also extends the pool of people that would have known where he was at and could have targeted him for a variety of reasons."
While there were other people in the house, Captain Tippet said that Pop Smoke was alone in one part of the home when the intruders found him. He was the only person who was shot at.
Some items were taken, Captain Tippet said, but there were also standard signs of a robbery that were absent, particularly ransacking. The intruders would have had to travel through some portion of the house before they found him, but they did not pull the place apart looking for valuables along the way.
"There were a couple of items that were taken, but some of the things you would think would be taken weren't even really looked for," Captain Tippet said. "So that's why we're not really saying that it was a robbery or that he was the intended target."
Pop Smoke was from Brooklyn, and Captain Tippet said that the L.A.P.D. had been informed by their East Coast counterparts that he had gang associations. (He also was facing federal charges of transporting a stolen Rolls-Royce across state lines, and for a time wore an ankle monitor because of a weapons charge.) But Captain Tippet said there was no indication at this point that a rival gang from the East Coast had come to Los Angeles to target him.
Captain Tippet said the police department was examining leads, and because the neighborhood of expensive homes was blanketed in cameras, they were also poring over large batches of video.
With a deep, gravelly voice and rugged style, Pop Smoke released his first album, "Meet the Woo," last July, featuring the hits "Welcome to the Party" and "Dior." He quickly went on to collaborate with big names like Nicki Minaj and Travis Scott. His second album was released this month, debuting at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart. Before he was killed, he had just returned from a publicity trip to London and was preparing for a concert tour in March.

Trump Campaign Pursues Libel Suit Against Times

Texto completo: The lawsuit concerns an essay published a year ago and headlined "The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo."
President Trump's re-election campaign sued The New York Times for libel on Wednesday, alleging that an Op-Ed article published by the newspaper falsely asserted a "quid pro quo" between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.
Mr. Trump often threatens to sue media organizations but rarely follows through. The lawsuit, filed in New York State court in Manhattan, is the first time his political operation has taken legal action against an American news outlet since he took office.
The lawsuit concerns an essay published by the Opinion section of The Times in March 2019. The article, headlined "The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo," was written by Max Frankel, who served as executive editor of The Times from 1986 to 1994. (The Opinion section of The Times operates separately from its newsroom.)
In the essay, Mr. Frankel wrote about communications between Mr. Trump's inner circle and Russian emissaries in the lead-up to the 2016 election. He concluded that, rather than any "detailed electoral collusion," the Trump campaign and Russian officials "had an overarching deal": "the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy."
The Trump lawsuit argues that this conclusion "is false" and that The Times published the essay "knowing it would misinform and mislead its own readers." The suit also accuses The Times, without evidence, of harboring "extreme bias against and animosity toward" Mr. Trump's re-election campaign.
The Times responded on Wednesday that it would fight the suit.
"The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable," Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said in a statement.
"Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance," Ms. Murphy added. "We look forward to vindicating that right in this case."
Mr. Trump, whose vilification of the news media has little precedent among past presidents, has ratcheted up his attacks on the press over the past year. He has accused The Times of "treason," tweeted the term "fake news" hundreds of times and threatened to pull broadcast licenses.
Asked about the lawsuit at a news conference at the White House on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump doubled down on his criticism of The Times. "It's beyond an opinion," he said of Mr. Frankel's Op-Ed article. "That's not an opinion. That's something much more than an opinion."
"They did a bad thing," the president added, "and there'll be more coming."
Earlier Wednesday, several media law experts reacted with skepticism about the Trump campaign's chances of succeeding in the suit.
"A publisher cannot be held liable for commentary based on public facts," said Brian Hauss, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union.
Frederick Schauer, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said public figures who sue for libel must show that a publisher either "knew it was false before publishing, or had actual suspicion of falsity and went ahead anyway." Proving that in court, he said, "is virtually impossible."
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Trump campaign by Charles J. Harder, a lawyer with a reputation for waging aggressive legal battles against prominent news organizations.
Mr. Harder is best known for representing Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, in a lawsuit against Gawker Media that was secretly underwritten by the tech investor Peter Thiel. The suit, which concerned the publication of a sex video, resulted in a $ 140 million decision that led to Gawker Media's bankruptcy and forced the site's sale.
Mr. Harder also represented Melania Trump, Mr. Trump's wife, when she sued The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, in 2016 over what she said were "false and defamatory statements," including that a modeling agency she worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The Daily Mail ultimately apologized, retracted the article and paid damages in a settlement.
This is not Mr. Trump's first time going to court against a journalist. In 2006, he sued Timothy L. O'Brien for libel after the publication of Mr. O'Brien's biography, "TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald." The case was dismissed three years later. (Mr. O'Brien, who previously worked as a reporter and editor at The Times, is a senior adviser to Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign.)
The Times is also defending itself in a defamation suit brought by Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential nominee, over an editorial published in the Opinion pages that incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting that severely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona. Ms. Palin's case was dismissed by a Federal District Court, but an appellate court reinstated the suit last year.

Texto completo: A new series about a superpowered Pennsylvania teenager hits Netflix. And "Star Trek Beyond" airs on Syfy.
What's Streaming
I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS Stream on Netflix. "I do want you to at least attempt to have a normal high school experience," a school counselor tells Sydney (Sophia Lillis) in this new series. That's not likely to happen: Sydney, a teenage girl in Pennsylvania, has superpowers that allow her to destroy objects with her mind. Adapted from a graphic novel by Charles Forsman, the series follows Sydney as she discovers those powers, which she grapples with alongside family tragedy and the awkward slog of high school. Helping her are a best friend (played by Sofia Bryant) and an eccentric young neighbor (Wyatt Oleff). The series "is firmly within both the superhero and teen-angst traditions," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times, "and, fair warning, is not immune to the clichés of either. What distinguishes it, however, beyond a tart voice and a pair of engaging performances, is that it commits as fully to its YA half as to its biff-pow-blam half."
UPGRADE (2018) Stream on HBO platforms. The filmmaker Leigh Whannell is behind the adaptation of H.G. Wells's "The Invisible Man" that hits theaters this weekend. While many may be most likely to know Whannell as a screenwriter ("Saw" and "Insidious"), he has directed a couple of other movies. The most recent of those, "Upgrade," is an action-horror romp that stars Logan Marshall-Green as Grey Trace, a man of the near future who has a technology implant that gives him superhuman abilities. He uses them to avenge his wife's killing. "'Upgrade' is an energetic, superficially slick, latter-day B-movie of the 'but dumb' category," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. "That is, it's kind of like 'RoboCop,' but dumb, and also like 'Ex Machina,' but dumb. In this respect the movie manages to be pretty funny."
BLUEBIRD (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Bluebird Cafe, the landmark Nashville venue known as a haven for songwriters, is shown off in this documentary. The movie captures Taylor Swift, Garth Brooks, Maren Morris, Kacey Musgraves, Jason Isbell, Steve Earle and other musicians praising the cafe.
What's on TV
STAR TREK BEYOND (2016) 6:30 p.m. on Syfy. After directing "Star Trek" (2009) and "Star Trek Into Darkness" (2013), J.J. Abrams jumped ship to helm "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." So directing duties for this third entry in the most recent "Star Trek" movie series went to Justin Lin, known for several of the "Fast and the Furious" movies. But "Beyond" brings back the series's key onscreen players, including James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Uhura (Zoe Saldana) and Sulu (John Cho). The villain this time is a warlord played by Idris Elba. "It should have been called 'Star Trek Within,"' A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "in honor of its determination to color inside the lines, obeying the ironclad conventions of brand and genre."

'Separation' Not 'Arrest,' Biden Camp Says Firmly

Texto completo: Joe Biden's claim of being arrested trying to see Nelson Mandela drew skepticism. His campaign called it a "separation."
CHARLESTON, S.C. -- At least three times this month, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has asserted that he was arrested as he sought to visit the anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela in prison, even saying that Mr. Mandela later thanked him for going to such an effort.
And for a week, Mr. Biden's campaign declined to answer questions seeking comment and clarification on those remarks, which were rebutted by a former United States ambassador to the United Nations in an article in The New York Times. Mr. Biden did not mention the episode in his memoir, had not spoken of it prominently on the campaign trail, and a review of available news accounts by The Times did not turn up any mention of an arrest.
But on Tuesday, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager, said Mr. Biden was referring to an episode in which he was separated from black colleagues in Johannesburg while on a congressional delegation trip to South Africa in the 1970s. It was the campaign's first explanation to date -- but one that still left many questions unanswered and did not square with Mr. Biden's most recent remarks.
"He was separated from his party at the airport," Ms. Bedingfield said when pressed by reporters following Tuesday's presidential debate here.
When a reporter noted that being separated did not constitute an arrest, she repeated: "It was a separation. They, he was not allowed to go through the same door that the -- the rest of the party he was with. Obviously, it was apartheid South Africa. There was a white door, there was a black door. He did not want to go through the white door and have the rest of the party go through the black door. He was separated. This was during a trip while they were there in Johannesburg."
Ms. Bedingfield's account echoes comments Mr. Biden has made in the past, including in his 2013 statement marking Mr. Mandela's death -- but that is not what he has relayed most recently as he campaigned in Nevada and South Carolina, two diverse states.
"I had the great honor of meeting him," he said of Mr. Mandela, speaking in South Carolina earlier this month. "I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him" on Robben Island, where Mr. Mandela was imprisoned. Soweto is more than 700 miles away from Robben Island.
Andrew Young, who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, told The Times that he had traveled with Mr. Biden to South Africa but had never been arrested there, and he cast doubt on the idea that members of Congress were arrested in the country.
"No, I was never arrested and I don't think he was, either," Mr. Young said in a telephone interview last week.
Mr. Biden also said recently that when Mr. Mandela was released, the civil rights leader thanked Mr. Biden during a trip to Washington.
"After he got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office," Mr. Biden said of Mr. Mandela while speaking in Las Vegas. "He threw his arms around me and said, 'I want to say thank you.' I said, 'What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?' He said, 'You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me."'
Ms. Bedingfield said that "it was a reference to Mandela coming to D.C. after he was released from prison, he met with Senator Biden, thanked him for his work, his anti-apartheid work."
She went on to cite Mr. Biden's "long record fighting apartheid" and said he was "one of the leading voices in the United States Senate in the '80s" on the issue.
Although Mr. Biden has previously said that Mr. Mandela thanked him for his support of anti-apartheid sanctions -- that was not his emphasis as he campaigned this month and spoke three times of being arrested.

Texto completo: With defense lawyers and prosecutors giving widely differing accounts of the night in question, a jury will weigh the evidence over the killing of a paramilitary officer in Rome by a pair of teenagers.
ROME -- The lives of two American teenagers and two Italian law enforcement officers crossed paths for less than a minute in the early hours of July 26, 2019.
Yet the consequences of that brief encounter began to be played out on Wednesday when the two Americans -- Finnegan Elder, now 20, and Gabriel Natale Hjorth, now 19 -- went on trial for the murder of Deputy Brig. Mario Cerciello Rega of the Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police force.
The case made front page news for days in Italy, and so many journalists packed the courtroom on Wednesday that Marina Finiti, the presiding judge, mulled moving future hearings to a much larger courthouse normally used for terrorism and mafia trials.
Camera shutters clicked wildly when Mr. Elder and Mr. Natale Hjorth entered the courtroom and took their seats next to their lawyers, avoiding eye contact with the crowd. Mr. Elder's parents and Mr. Natale Hjorth's uncle sat in the back row. Mr. Cerciello Rega's widow and his brother sat two rows ahead.
The circumstances that led to the 32-second aggression, the time estimated by court documents, remain unclear, though the two teenagers were arrested at a four-star hotel room and jailed just hours after the fact, the murder weapon found in their possession.
Ultimately the jury will be asked to deliberate whether the two Americans were aware that Brigadier Cerciello Rega, who was 35 when he died, and his partner, Carabinieri Officer Andrea Varriale, were plainclothes officers.
Prosecutors say the teenagers attacked the officers to avoid arrest, while the teenagers say they acted in self-defense, believing the two plainclothes officers to be ill-intentioned thugs.
"We have diametrically opposed hypotheses of the dynamics of that night," said Fabio Alonzi, a lawyer for Mr. Natale Hjorth. "The question is to see which hypothesis has more supporting evidence."
The public outpouring of grief for Brigadier Cerciello Rega was immediate, if stoked by nationalist lawmakers fueling the perception -- often not borne out by facts -- of a country at the mercy of drug dealers, petty criminals and lawless immigrants. His funeral, broadcast on national television, became a state affair attended by government officials and other authorities.
For investigators -- the Nucleo Investigativo Carabinieri of Rome, officers who are part of the same paramilitary corps as the victim -- it was a clear-cut case.
The killing of Brigadier Cerciello Rega, they say, was the culmination of a series of fateful events that unfolded that muggy summer night after the two teenagers set off to buy drugs in Rome's trendy Trastevere area, and the deal went bad.
Shortly after midnight, four off-duty carabinieri singled them out in Piazza Trilussa. In text messages to each other, they described them as "polli," or chickens, which in Italian refers to someone who is easily duped.
The teenagers found a middleman, Sergio Brugiatelli, a habitué of the Trastevere night life, who offered to hook them up with a dealer. The off-duty carabinieri tailed them as they walked to Piazza Mastai, about 10 minutes away.
Mr. Natale Hjorth handed over 80 euros, about $ 87, to the dealer and the off-duty officers interrupted the deal, identifying themselves as carabinieri, and the boys ran, according to the investigators' report.
The teenagers said they were skeptical that the men who had identified themselves as carabinieri were really law-enforcement officers.
"What cops just take your money and then let you run?" Mr. Elder told Craig Peters, a San Francisco-based lawyer assisting the Elder family, according to a transcript of a wiretapped prison conversation seen by The New York Times that prosecutors have presented as evidence.
Last week, several Italian newspapers published parts of the transcript, revealing that the translations used by the carabinieri to bolster their case were misleading, while some passages that favored the defense case had been omitted. Mr. Alonzi said the investigators had "made some glaring errors."
As they fled from Trastevere, Mr. Natale Hjorth and Mr. Elder took Mr. Brugiatelli's backpack, which he had left on a bench.
In the transcript, Mr. Elder said they had taken the backpack because they were angry that they had been duped.
But Mr. Brugiatelli had left his phone in his backpack, which allowed for negotiations to begin for its return.
Defense lawyers for Mr. Natale Hjorth say that the teenagers merely wanted to get their €80 back and were willing to exchange the backpack for it.
Several conversations ensued. The defense lawyers say that at one point the Americans had decided to call it quits, but Mr. Brugiatelli insisted that they meet. Carabinieri officials asked Brigadier Cerciello Rega and Officer Varriale to assist Mr. Brugiatelli with the retrieval. That night, the two men were on duty in plain clothes.
Officer Varriale testified that he and his partner had told the two Americans that they were carabinieri, showing their badges. The two teenagers say the officers did not. Officer Varriale said he had heard his partner shout, "Stop! We are carabinieri." The teenagers say he did not.
In the investigators' account, the teenagers "put up lightning-fast resistance." Officer Varriale was "kicked and punched" by Mr. Natale Hjorth, who managed to get away, while Brigadier Cerciello Rega was repeatedly stabbed by Mr. Elder, it says.
At 3:16 a.m., while his colleague lay stricken, Officer Varriale called for help. Brigadier Cerciello Rega died shortly after at Rome's Santo Spirito hospital.
Officer Varriale initially told investigators that he had his gun with him and identified the two assailants as North Africans.
It later emerged that neither officer had a gun or handcuffs, and that Brigadier Cerciello Rega did not have his badge with him. It remains unclear whether Officer Varriale had his, as an inventory of his possessions at the time has not been given to the court.
"We are absolutely certain that the two boys -- especially Finn, who doesn't speak a word of Italian -- had no idea that they were policemen," said Renato Borzone, another Italian lawyer for Mr. Elder.
Mr. Alonzi pointed out that the two Americans had expected to meet up with Mr. Brugiatelli but instead found "two guys, a little older" than themselves. "It was natural to be taken off guard," he said.
Defense lawyers for both have criticized the carabinieri's behavior that night as sloppy and unprofessional.
"It's hard to believe that such a longstanding police force doesn't have processes and procedures, but the Carabinieri in this case appeared not to have followed many," said Mr. Peters.
Leah Elder, Mr. Elder's mother, who arrived in Rome this week for the trial, said: "This tragedy never should have happened."
Court papers show that the two officers left their radio in the car, making it harder for them to be tracked down once Brigadier Cerciello Rega was wounded. They did not alert headquarters as to their whereabouts in order to prepare a backup car.
"It's all without sense -- we have to understand why this happened," Mr. Borzone said.
If the Americans are found guilty, they risk spending their life behind bars.
Wednesday's hearing dealt with procedural matters, including the admission of civil parties seeking damages.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers also haggled over witnesses and admissible evidence.
Mr. Natale Hjorth's defense asked for the admission of a video that was recently circulated by Italian media showing their client sitting handcuffed and blindfolded in the police station shortly after his arrest, answering questions without a lawyer present. The prosecution objected, saying what occurred after the murder was irrelevant.
The trial resumes on March 9.

Texto completo: "We can lie": A detective pretended to have evidence linking a 13-year-old to the stabbing of Ms. Majors.
The grainy video shows a hesitant 13-year-old leaning over a table in a windowless interrogation room. Two detectives are questioning him about the fatal stabbing of Tessa Majors in Morningside Park.
The boy's voice quivers: "I don't know about the stabbing. I don't know about the stabbing."
Then Detective Wilfredo Acevedo leans over and says the police have video footage and other evidence that puts the boy and two middle school friends at the park when Ms. Majors was killed.
"I'm going to be asking questions," Detective Acevedo says. "I already know the answers."
Over the next few minutes, the boy described in chilling detail the last moments of Ms. Majors's life as a video camera recorded his remarks at the 26th Precinct station house a day after the killing.
Ms. Majors, a Barnard College freshman, was walking through the park near 116th Street in Manhattan on Dec. 11 when three teenagers tried to mug her, prosecutors say. One teenager prevented her from running away and a second stabbed her after she refused to hand over her cellphone.
The detective's tactics during the interrogation were the focus of a hearing in Family Court for the youngest of three teenagers charged in Ms. Majors's murder. Judge Carol Goldstein must decide if the video can be used as evidence at the boy's trial next month.
Public defenders representing the 13-year-old argued the interrogation should be thrown out because Detective Acevedo had used intimidation and deception to get the confession, falsely suggesting he had seen evidence placing the boy in the park.
"When you said that, it is your understanding that that is not actually true?" Hannah Kaplan of the Legal Aid Society asked the detective.
"That's correct," Detective Acevedo responded. "I just wanted him to tell me what occurred in the park. That's all. We can lie, yes."
Bluffing is a common tactic to elicit information from people arrested during an interrogation, police officials said.
The teenager has been charged with second-degree felony murder as a juvenile. He is not accused of taking part in the stabbing, but in the robbery that preceded it, the authorities said.
During the questioning, he identified his two 14-year-old accomplices, who were initially questioned and released after they refused to answer questions on the advice of their lawyers.
Two months later, the Manhattan district attorney charged the other two boys, Rashaun Weaver and Luchiano Lewis, with second-degree murder and robbery. Mr. Weaver is accused of stabbing Ms. Majors and Mr. Lewis of holding her when she tried to flee, the authorities said. They are being tried as adults.
Ms. Majors's murder rattled the city and evoked comparisons to the 1989 April attack on a jogger in Central Park. In that case, the police and prosecutors relied on tough interrogation techniques to obtain confessions from five teenagers, who were convicted in the brutal assault and rape of the jogger. The confessions were later proven to be false and the convictions were overturned.
The authorities say they took extra steps in Ms. Majors's case to ensure that the teenagers were questioned in the presence of a lawyer or a legal guardian. The 13-year-old boy's uncle was present when he was questioned.
But on Wednesday, Ms. Kaplan, a public defender, argued that the uncle, Roosevelt Davis, was no substitute for an attorney. Ms. Kaplan said that Mr. Davis did not possess the training to know Detective Acevedo could lie during the interview. Neither was Mr. Davis aware he could have stopped the questioning at any time.
Detective Acevedo told the judge that Mr. Davis told him, "I don't have any issues talking with you guys" about his nephew's arrest.
During one portion of the video shown during Wednesday's hearing, the teenager described part of the attack on Ms. Majors, an aspiring musician and journalist who had come from Virginia to study at Barnard.
The teenager said Mr. Weaver and Mr. Lewis became irate when Ms. Majors refused to hand over her cellphone on a set of stairs in the park.
"So they got mad. And then, and then, she was probably refusing to give it to them," the boy said on the video. "And they got mad. They probably took it from her."
The 13-year-old, wearing a black jacket, dark blue sweatpants and Nike sneakers, bit his lip nervously as parts of his interview were played in the courtroom. His aunt, Shaquoya Carr, sat in a row behind him taking notes quietly.
Ms. Kaplan has also sought to undermine Detective Acevedo's credibility, pointing out he been accused of misconduct in lawsuits and other complaints, including false arrest, making false accusations and withholding evidence helpful to a defendant.
The police department said in a statement that Detective Acevedo had never been found by a judge or by the city's Civilian Complaint Review Board to have made a single false statement or false arrest.
"The calculated, personal attacks against a member of the investigative team working to solve the murder of Tessa Majors is an obvious and unethical effort to make prejudicial statements outside the courtroom to affect a jury pool," the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said in an earlier statement.
At an earlier hearing in Criminal Court, prosecutors had said they had a recording in which Mr. Weaver implicated himself in the murder, saying he had attacked Ms. Majors because "she was hanging on to her phone." A witness also told police Ms. Majors was heard yelling "Help me! I'm being robbed!"
Moments later, she was stabbed four times, the blade piercing her heart once, court records show.
As he talked to the 13-year-old suspect, Detective Acevedo tried to earn the youngster's trust by telling him, "You're not a bad kid" and asking him whether his uncle taught him right from wrong.
"I'm telling you there's video inside the whole park," Detective Acevedo told the boy. "The reason I'm talking to you is because I know you were there."
"If you are lying," he added, "you would get in a lot, a lot of trouble."
Eventually the teenager turned to his uncle, Mr. Davis, said that he and his friends had gone to the park looking for someone to rob and began to describe what happened, the detective said. "His response was to his uncle, not to me," Detective Acevedo said. "I felt it was more forthcoming, more truthful."

Not all it's cracked up to be Streaming TV's boom is a mixed blessing for some Hollywood writers

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - It seemed like a good deal. At first.
Last April, Netflix offered Kay Reindl and her longtime writing partner a substantial sum - in the mid-six figures, Reindl said - to oversee 10 episodes of a new sci-fi series, "Sentient." It sounded like a lot of money for what they figured would be less than a year of work.
Reindl and her writing partner, who have worked steadily as TV writers since the 1990s, would be executive producers, instead of staff writers on someone else's show. That would mean a lot more responsibility and much longer hours, but it seemed worth it. They found office space and hired a few writers.
Then came a surprise: They learned that "Sentient" would actually take 18 months from start to finish. When Reindl did the math, she realized that, under the new timetable, she would be making roughly the same weekly pay as the writers she was overseeing.
"It was a very bad day," Reindl said.
Netflix declined to comment.
The rise of streaming has been a blessing and a curse for working writers like Reindl, who said she and her partner had ultimately left "Sentient" because of creative differences unrelated to the length of the series. On-demand digital video has ushered in the era of Peak TV, meaning there are more shows and more writing jobs than ever. But many of the jobs are not what they used to be in the days before streaming.
"All this opportunity is great, but how to navigate it and keep yourself consistently working and making your living has been the challenging part," said Stu Zicherman, a writer and showrunner whose credits include "The Americans" on FX and HBO's "Divorce."
When Reindl got her start, network series had 24 episodes or more a season. The typical TV writer's schedule looked something like this: Get hired by May or June, write furiously for most of the year and then take a six-week hiatus before the process started again.
The seasonal rhythms that had been in place for TV writers since the days of "I Love Lucy" started to change more than two decades ago, when cable outlets put out 13-episode seasons of shows like HBO's "The Sopranos" and, later, AMC's "Mad Men."
Streaming platforms have revised that model further: eight-episode seasons of Netflix's "Stranger Things" and Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian"; six-episode seasons of Amazon Prime Video's "Fleabag"; three- and six-episode batches of Netflix's "Black Mirror." Cable has replied in kind, offering fewer than 12-episode runs of shows.
"I think they're experimenting with the shortest product they can still call a TV series," said Steve Conrad, president of Elephant Pictures, a production company in Chicago.
Complicating the issue is that streaming platforms have been known to take more time to make an episode than their network and cable counterparts. For many writers, that meant less money for more hours.
The Writers Guild of America has worked out some protections for its union members. Since 2018, studios are sometimes required to pay writers extra when filming runs longer than expected.
Streaming seasons that require a short time commitment - say, eight months - can also wreak havoc on a writer's schedule. "You're not being paid by the studio for five months of the year," said Conrad, "but that's not enough time to take on another show."
Caption: Rob Long, once a writer and an executive producer of "Cheers," has had to adjust to shorter seasons and unpredictable schedules.

Texto completo: On Monday's episode of "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon," fans watched as BTS, an ensemble of dancers and a marching band rocked out to the band's new single, “On,” in the middle of Grand Central Terminal.
But how was the hit South Korean group able to get one of New York City's busiest sites all to themselves?
Turns out, the five-minute spectacle took two months and a small army to organize, Metro-North Railroad officials told The New York Times in an article published Tuesday.
A crew of about 180 people arrived at the train station at 10 p. m. on Feb. 8, more than a week before the show aired. The dancers and marching band rehearsed in Vanderbilt Hall and the North West Balcony rooms while the crew set up their cameras and people left the busy transit hub, said Meredith Conti, Metro-North’s manager of special events.
BTS didn’t set foot on the terminal floor until it closed at 2 a. m. , so they could avoid being spotted, Conti said. They had about two hours to shoot the video before the terminal’s cleaning staff arrived to wash the floors.
Gavin Purcell, the show’s interim showrunner, wrote on Twitter that the episode was “our love letter to this city. ”

In California: Drain the reservoir, feds say, and all the latest on coronavirus

Texto completo: The feds want a reservoir near San Jose drained by Oct. 1 over earthquake fears. The court tells Kern County one permit cannot cover 72,000 new oil wells. Plus, Vice President Mike Pence takes the reins on coronavirus in the U. S. as agencies across the state declare local emergencies.

Feds want Bay Area reservoir drained ASAP
Federal regulators are ordering a large reservoir south of San Jose be drained because of concerns that its dam may collapse in an earthquake, leading to a massive release of water that could flood much of Silicon Valley.
The demand comes on the heels of a nonexistent rainy season. Drought, anyone?
Local authorities agree the 240-foot-high earthen Anderson Dam is a risk but say emptying it threatens wildlife, habitat and residents downstream. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wants the work to start no later than Oct. 1.
Anderson Reservoir, also known as Anderson Lake, holds close to 90,000 acre-feet of water, accounting for more than half the district’s capacity of 170,000 acre-feet in all 10 of its reservoirs.

72,000 oil wells cannot be approved under one permit, court rules
It used to be one approval cleared the way for 72,000 new oil wells in Kern County. Now, following a California appellate court ruling on Tuesday, each project will have to be looked at for its specific impact on air quality, drinking water, wildlife and other factors.
The Fifth District Court of Appeals, based in Fresno, ruled Kern County's ordinance ignored threats to public health from particulate soot, and impacts to drinking and agricultural water supplies, along with other deficiencies.
“This is a huge victory for our health and climate,” said Hollin Kretzmann, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, part of a coalition of groups that challenged the policy. She said the blanket approval was basically a "rubber-stamping" of all the oil well applications and related equipment.
Kern County officials and oil representatives did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Coronavirus: Everything to know about the virus on the verge of a pandemic
The spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed thousands of people and infected tens of thousands more across dozens of countries, may have started with something simple – a person buying food for dinner at an outdoor market.
Researchers theorize someone bought contaminated meat at a Wuhan market, ate it, got sick and infected others, creating a ripple effect around the world.
Health officials in the U. S. warned this week that the virus has met two of the three criteria of a pandemic: The coronavirus has caused sickness and death and sustained person-to-person transmission.
Since Jan. 20, cases of Covid-19 worldwide have surged to 81,280 across 41 countries, according to Johns Hopkins. The death toll stands at 2,770 as of Wednesday. All but 55 of the deaths have been in mainland China.
There were 57 cases of the coronavirus in the U. S. as of last count.

Texto completo: Trump says we're ready
President Donald Trump said the nation is prepared for the coronavirus during a Wednesday press conference where he announced that Vice President Mike Pence would lead the administration's response.
"We're very, very ready for this," Trump said. "The risk to the American people remains very low. "
Trump said he trusted the advice from his top health officials, but he also at times appeared to contradict him. The president repeatedly said he didn’t believe it was inevitable that the virus would spread in the United States but acknowledged that it “probably” would.

Texto completo: ABC News suspended one of its veteran correspondents late Tuesday for unguarded remarks he made in a video by operatives of Project Veritas, the conservative group that records 'undercover' footage of mainstream journalists to bolster its accusations of media bias.
The network disciplined David Wright, who reports for ABC's signature news programs, including 'World News Tonight,' 'Good Morning America' and 'Nightline,' several people confirmed late Tuesday.
The choppy, poorly shot video, released Wednesday morning by Project Veritas, captured Wright on what appeared to be a hidden camera, seeming to complain in general terms about political coverage.
'I don't think we're terribly interested in voters,' he said, echoing gripes about the superficiality of some aspects of White House and campaign coverage that have been raised by journalists for decades. Also: 'Commercial imperative is incompatible with news.'
At one point he says: 'We don't hold him to account. We also don't give him credit for what things he does do.' In subtitles, Project Veritas indicated that 'him' stood for President Trump.
But ABC probably was also alarmed at Wright's criticism of ABC News, which is owned by the Disney Co. At another point, he raises another longstanding critique of ABC News " that it blends news with promotion of Disney-owned movies and TV programs.
'Like now you can't watch 'Good Morning America' without there being a Disney princess or a Marvel Avenger appearing,' he says. 'It's all self-promotional.'
In a statement Wednesday, ABC News said, 'Any action that damages our reputation for fairness and impartiality or gives the appearance of compromising it harms ABC News and the individuals involved. David Wright has been suspended, and to avoid any possible appearance of bias, he will be reassigned away from political coverage when he returns.'
In the video, which the group said was taken while Wright covered the New Hampshire primary, a voice asks the reporter if he considers himself 'a Democratic socialist,' and Wright seems to reply, 'more than that, I consider myself a socialist.'
Wright didn't respond to several requests for comment Tuesday.
Project Veritas's founder, James O'Keefe, teased the release of the video on Twitter on Tuesday with the hashtag #ExposeABC. He tweeted that his group 'will expose ABC News' agenda to mislead voters and push their own narratives' and said in response to the upcoming release that ABC News had suspended 'the correspondent involved.' He didn't identify Wright or provide details.
Wright, 56, is one of ABC's most seasoned and versatile correspondents, having joined the network nearly 20 years ago. He has covered the White House and was 'Nightline's' lead political reporter during the 2016 presidential campaign. He has also periodically reported from the Middle East and Europe, including covering the Notre Dame Cathedral fire in Paris last year. He shared a 2004 Emmy Award for his reporting from Iraq and shared a Peabody Award for reporting in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
Project Veritas conducts undercover 'stings' of journalists and others it considers allied with liberal causes or organizations. Its operatives often befriend the organization's targets using aliases and lull them into casual conversations in bars or restaurants that are then surreptitiously recorded. The videos are edited and released publicly in an effort to show what O'Keefe calls liberal bias or allegedly corrupt practices.
Although O'Keefe has defended the organization's methods as journalistically sound, mainstream news organizations have largely abandoned the practice of infiltrating businesses or organizations to record video without a subject's knowledge or consent. News organizations generally consider the practice deceptive, and doing so can subject them to criminal trespass penalties.
O'Keefe's group has targeted media organizations such as CNN, NPR and the New York Times, as well as Democratic political operatives.
The Washington Post was the target of a Project Veritas sting in 2017 when a woman, later identified as Jaime Phillips, approached a Post reporter with allegedly damaging information about Roy Moore, then a Senate candidate in Alabama. The Post discovered the woman's apparent affiliation with Project Veritas and that her story was a hoax. The Post recorded video as she attempted to plant the false story.
ABC, coincidentally, was involved in perhaps the most famous case involving undercover video. The Food Lion supermarket chain sued ABC in 1996 after it aired a segment about unsanitary practices at the stores on 'PrimeTime Live.' To get footage for the story, two ABC News producers obtained jobs at Food Lion stores using false references and altered work histories. An appeals court eventually rejected Food Lion's fraud claims but upheld a jury's $2 award for breach of loyalty and trespass.

Trump Campaign Sues New York Times Over Opinion Piece; A Times spokeswoman says 'the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump's campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements in an opinion piece on the 2016 election and Russia.
The piece, headlined "The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo," was published in March 2019 and was written by Max Frankel, who was executive editor of the Times from 1986 to 1994.
Mr. Frankel wrote, "There was no need for detailed electoral collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's oligarchy because they had an overarching deal: the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration's burdensome economic sanctions. The Trumpites knew about the quid and held out the prospect of the quo."
The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages and was filed Wednesday with the New York State Supreme Court, states the piece doesn't cite proof for claims of a quid pro quo or a deal between the campaign and Russia.
"The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable," a spokeswoman for the newspaper said in a statement. "Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance."
Asked at a press conference whether it was appropriate to sue a news organization that had published an unfavorable opinion of him, the president said the newspaper had gotten "the opinion totally wrong."
"It's beyond an opinion," he said, adding, "there will be more coming."
The suit states the "falsity of the story" was confirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Mr. Mueller's report detailed a series of contacts between Russians and Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., but didn't establish a conspiracy between the campaign and the Russian government to interfere in the election.
While the Times published Mr. Frankel's piece before the Mueller report was made public, the lawsuit contends that the Times had already reported details about the meetings that, the suit said, indicated there was no deal or quid pro quo.
Mr. Trump Jr. testified before Congress in September 2017 that he agreed to meet a Russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump's 2016 rival, because he believed the meeting could shed light on the "fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate."
Among the examples the suit cites is a statement from the president's son saying the meeting "provided no meaningful information."
He also said, "I did not collude with any foreign government and do not know of anyone who did."
The suit was filed on behalf of the campaign by lawyer Charles Harder, who in the same capacity in October 2019 sent a letter to CNN threatening to sue the network over its coverage. CNN dismissed it as a "PR stunt." Mr. Harder had previously taken successful action on behalf of Hulk Hogan against Gawker.com, which ultimately led to the site folding.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Clive Cussler, the million-selling adventure writer and real-life thrill-seeker who wove personal details and spectacular fantasies into his page-turning novels about underwater explorer Dirk Pitt, has died, his publisher said Wednesday.
Cussler died Monday at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, said Alexis Welby, spokeswoman for publisher Penguin Random House. He was 88. The cause was not disclosed.
Cussler dispatched Pitt and pal Al Giordino on exotic missions highlighted by shipwrecks, treachery, espionage and beautiful women, in popular works including "Cyclops," "Night Probe!" and his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!"
Cussler
Cussler was an Illinois native who was raised in Southern California and lived in Arizona for most of his final years, but he sent Pitt around the globe in plots that ranged from the bold to the incredible. "The Treasure" features an aspiring Aztec despot who murders an American envoy, the hijacking of a plane carrying the United Nations secretary-general and soldiers from ancient Rome looting the Library of Alexandria. In "Iceberg," the presidents of French Guiana and the Dominican Republic are the ones in danger, during a visit to Disneyland. In "Sahara," a race across the desert somehow leads to new information about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
"Again and again, Dirk Pitt, working for the fictional National Underwater and Marine Agency, must find a sunken vessel and retrieve some artifact," Mark Schone, summarizing Cussler's novels, wrote in The New York Times in 2004. "Evil forces, be they Commies or Blofeldian madmen, try to stop him. Along the way Pitt saves himself, the world and the damsel of the moment."
Cussler has a new novel, "Journey of the Pharaohs," set to be released March 10, with several more awaiting posthumous publication.
In real life, Cussler founded his own National Underwater and Marine Agency and participated in dozens of searches for old ships, including one that turned up a steamship belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt. He also had a long history of questionable claims -- some admitted, some denied.
"He can definitely spin the tall tales and is a master of fiction. But that doesn't mean I buy into his alleged discovery claims," Dr. E. Lee Spence wrote on his blog in 2011. Spence, a prominent underwater archaeologist feuded with Cussler over which of them recovered a Confederate submarine.
Born an only child in 1931 in Aurora, Illinois, and raised in Alhambra, California, Cussler's name and writing persona have the air of a pseudonym, but he was born with his moniker, named for the British actor Clive Brook. He studied for two years at Pasadena City College before enlisting in the Air Force and serving as a mechanic and flight engineer during the Korean War.
In 1955, he married Barbara Knight, with whom he had three children. Through much of the 1960s, he worked in advertising, as a copywriter and creative director. Among the better known slogans he helped coin -- "It's stronger than dirt," for an Ajax laundry detergent campaign.
In his free time, he was writing fiction and moonlighting at a skin-diving equipment shop, where his wife suggested he work to help gather material for his novels.
"When creating advertising, I had always looked at the competition and wondered what I could conceive that was totally different," Cussler said in an interview included in "Dirk Pitt Revealed," a nonfiction book released in 1998. "(James) Bond was becoming incredibly popular through the movies, and I knew I couldn't match Ian Fleming's style and prose. So I was determined not to write about a detective, secret agent or undercover investigator or deal in murder mysteries. My hero's adventures would be based on and under water."
Cussler finished manuscripts for "Mediterranean Caper" and "Iceberg," but had no literary agent: so he created one. He purchased a thousand sheets of blank letter paper, got a friend in advertising to design a logo for "The Charles Winthrop Agency" and sent his first inquiry to Peter Lampack of the William Morris Agency. Lampack agreed to take on Cussler and remained with him long after the author confessed his charade.
"I told him the story of Charlie Winthrop with great trepidation," Cussler explained to the Arizona Republic. "I sat there waiting for the result, and he sat there blank for a minute, and then he laughed himself under the table. And he said, 'Oh my God. I always thought Charlie Winthrop was some guy I met while I was drunk at a cocktail party.'"
"Mediterranean Caper" came out in 1973, followed by "Iceberg" two years later and "Raise the Titanic!" in 1976. He would turn out more than 20 Dirk Pitt novels and expand into children's books and such adventure series as "The Oregon Files" and "The Numa Files."
Cussler had claimed his worldwide sales topped 100 million copies, but in a legal battle with Crusader Entertainment, which alleged he had misrepresented his popularity, it was determined the number was closer to 40 million. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded Crusader $5 million but also ordered that Cussler receive $8.5 million because the film company only adapted one ("Sahara") of the two books it had agreed to produce.
The film version of "Sahara" came out in 2005 and starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz. An adaptation of "Raise the Titanic!" -- its title the same except for dropping the exclamation point, came out in 1980 and featured Jason Robards and Alec Guinness.
In recent years, Cussler began working with co-authors and collaborated with his son on "Poseidon's Arrow," "Crescent Dawn" and "Arctic Drift." Cussler's son is Dirk Cussler. Pitt himself had a son, called, of course, Dirk Pitt Jr.
In addition to Dirk Cussler, the author is survived by his second wife, Janet, daughters Teri and Dayna, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

In Our View: It takes a village to combat child sexual abuse

Texto completo: The issue of child sex abuse on the internet is effectively summed up by Dr. Kathie Mathis.
“One of the biggest obstacles I face when I'm out doing training is the response, ‘Those are other countries,' ” said Mathis, a psychologist who is training director for Vancouver-based National Women's Coalition Against Violence and Exploitation. “Trafficking and child sex abuse is huge in America. It's happening in every state, every county, and it's in your community. We can't and don't want to comprehend something like child sex abuse, but we need to mature as a society if we're all going to be part of a solution.”
Indeed, it is happening everywhere, as detailed in an extensive article by Columbian reporter Jerzy Shedlock. The sexual exploitation of minors is happening in our community, in the shadows where it is difficult for law enforcement to shine a light.
Technology companies last year reported 69.1 million files of images and videos to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse that works with law enforcement agencies. That was an increase of about 50 percent from the previous year. Meanwhile, the Clark County Prosecutor's Office has filed at least 22 cases each of the past three years, after prosecuting as few as four in 2010.
An investigation by the New York Times surmised for a series of articles in September: “Twenty years ago, the images were a problem; 10 years ago, an epidemic. Now, the crisis is at a breaking point.”
“It's hard to see the numbers continue to go up,” Clark County Prosecutor Tony Golik told The Columbian. “As a prosecutor, when we see a troubling trend, we'll try to move in on it, try to solve it, but this issue seems to be getting worse. There are more and more of these depictions on the internet, and law enforcement seems to be dealing with a never-ending amount of work on these cases.”
With the internet being increasingly accessible to the point where most people carry it on their phones, and with abusers better able to communicate and share videos, law enforcement is perpetually a step or two behind in dealing with the issue. In one recent case, a 62-year-old Vancouver man was sentenced to four years in prison after coercing a 13-year-old girl to send him nude photos. Officers recovered files that stored nearly 3,000 images and 77 videos.
Shockingly, that is a relatively pedestrian example of the child sexual abuse available on the internet. Images, experts say, often depict instances of incest and often involve very young children.
A 2008 federal law presaged much of the issue, but the New York Times investigation found that the federal government has not followed through with many provisions. The Justice Department has produced just two of the six reports required by the law, and a lack of funding has hampered efforts. Francey Hakes, formerly the national coordinator for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction, said nobody “felt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.”
Locally, Clark County has developed a robust response to the sexual exploitation of children, with a team of investigators and prosecutors addressing the issue. But this is a global problem. When abuse is recorded in, say, Tulsa, it does not remain there; images are readily available to pedophiles in Vancouver.
While the Clark County Prosecutor's Office is doing what it can to combat the issue at the local level, a concerted nat

Steve Bannon’s Use of Private Jet Linked to Chinese Businessman Could Violate Campaign Finance Law

Former Donald Trump campaign CEO and chief strategist Steve Bannon used a private jet apparently owned by a wealthy Chinese businessman to fly to events to promote Republican congressional candidates in 2018.
The previously unreported flights could run afoul of a campaign finance law that bars foreign money from U.S. elections, according to campaign finance experts, though it depends on several factors that are not known. One of the unknowns is whether Bannon paid Guo Wengui — the Chinese businessman, who is a vocal critic of the Chinese regime, and with whom he has other reported financial ties — for the use of the jet.
Bannon flew on the jet, a Bombardier Global Express that can seat up to 13 people, to 2018 events supporting Republican candidates in New Mexico and Arizona. He also flew on it to Mexico City and New York, and possibly to other cities. The flights were confirmed by footage taken for “The Brink,” a 2019 documentary about Bannon, and by videos of Guo on the plane, interviews and FAA flight records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
“The foreign-national prohibition is the broadest prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act,” said Brett Kappel, a government affairs partner at the Akerman law firm, speaking generally. “It prohibits foreign nationals from making any contribution or donation in connection with any election in the United States. It also precludes foreign nationals from making in-kind contributions, such as paying for campaign-related travel.”
The same law also prohibits receiving such a donation. Bannon’s one-way trip from New York to New Mexico alone would be worth around $35,000, according to public jet charter rates.
Lawyers for Bannon and Guo (who is also known as Miles Kwok) did not dispute that Bannon used the Chinese businessman’s plane for trips. But Cleta Mitchell, an attorney representing Bannon’s nonprofit, Citizens of the American Republic, wrote in an email, “The meetings and rallies hosted by COAR in 2018 were to promote the film, Trump@War, and to encourage Trump supporters to vote in 2018. These were not candidate or campaign rallies.” Guo’s attorney said in a statement that “Mr. Guo has not participated in or supported, directly or indirectly, any political activity or party in the United States or elsewhere. To the contrary, Mr. Guo has consistently emphasized that he has no desire to participate in politics anywhere.”
Nothing about the trips appears to have been disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, either by Bannon or the congressional candidates he traveled to support.
Guo told Vice in 2017 that he owns two private jets. Han Lianchao, a Guo associate, told ProPublica, “I know he allowed Steve to use his private jet from time to time.” Han said he did not know the specifics of their arrangement. A Bannon aide also told Alison Klayman, the filmmaker who made “The Brink” and flew on the jet, that it belonged to Guo, Klayman told ProPublica.
In one scene in the film, Bannon is shown on the plane praising Guo’s analysis of Chinese politics while on a flight from New York to Dallas in October 2018.
A still from "The Brink," top, shows Bannon on a jet that closely resembles one in which Guo is seen on his YouTube channel, bottom.
Official records don’t identify the ultimate owner of the jet, which bears the tail number T7-GQM. The jet is registered in the tiny Republic of San Marino to Whitecroft Shore Limited. That, in turn, is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, an offshore dominion known for secrecy. There are multiple videos online of Guo that appear to be taken on the plane that match independent photos of the interior and exterior of the jet with the same tail number. Other articles link the jet to Guo.
Bannon left the Trump White House in the summer of 2017 and has spent the past couple of years jetting around the country and the globe to promote right-wing causes, candidates and his own brand. It is a continuing mystery who is supporting his efforts. His use of the Guo plane helps fill out the picture.
The unlikely relationship between Bannon and Guo is one of the defining features of Bannon’s post-White House career. It continues through the present, with Bannon and Guo frequently appearing together on Bannon’s podcast and Guo’s news site commenting on Trump, China and the coronavirus, among other topics.
Guo, who has described himself as a successful real estate developer and investor, left China for the U.S. in 2015 and is reportedly seeking asylum. He is a critic of Chinese leaders, churning out a stream of online videos commenting on the news of the day, from the coronavirus to his “crusade against communism.” The Chinese government has, in turn, sought Guo’s arrest on corruption allegations, which he has denied. Guo frequently appears in videos with Bannon, who has predicted a war between the U.S. and China and says he is currently producing a “takedown” film about Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The New York Times recently reported that Bannon’s relationship with Guo began with a $150,000 loan to Bannon shortly after his 2017 departure from the Trump administration. Axios reported that a company linked to Guo had contracted with Bannon for at least $1 million for “strategic consulting services,” beginning in August 2018. (A Guo spokesman told Axios that the contract was for media investment and other consulting, and that Guo “had no involvement in [Bannon] being retained.”)

In fall 2018, Bannon and his dark money organization, Citizens of the American Republic, were pushing to keep Republican control of Congress during the midterm elections. A Bannon aide told ABC at the time that the group had an election war room focused on “explaining that a vote for any House Republican is a vote to stop the Democrats.”
Bannon made the trips to promote GOP candidates on the Bombardier jet in October 2018, under the aegis of Citizens of the American Republic. (The organization raised a total of $4.5 million in 2018 from a handful of donors, according to its filing with the IRS. But as a “social welfare” nonprofit organized under section 501(c)4 of the Internal Revenue Code, it is not required to reveal its donors.)
One of the trips was to Arizona in support of congressional candidate Wendy Rogers. Bannon told the Arizona Daily Star at the time: “If she can beat [Rep. Tom] O’Halleran, we’ll hold the House. We’ll hold the House by one or two seats. And that’s why it’s so important, and that’s why I wanted to come down here.”
Rogers, who ultimately lost the race, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
The trip to Roswell, New Mexico, featured U.S. Senate candidate Mick Rich and a screening of Bannon’s film “Trump@War.” According to video from the Roswell event viewed by ProPublica, Bannon and Rich strategized about the campaign before Bannon’s public remarks. “Tell me about this race,” Bannon said in the video. “How are we going to win this thing? I’ll come back here as many times as — ” Rich interjected: “Getting you out here is number one.” Rich also asked if Bannon could get President Trump to tweet about the race, and Bannon said he would try.
During the public event, Rich introduced Bannon, who in turn praised the Senate candidate as a “real populist.” Bannon urged the audience members to vote for pro-Trump candidates.
Rich lost the 2018 race and is running again this year. A spokesman told ProPublica in a statement that “Mick and his campaign had no knowledge of Bannon’s transportation to or from the event. Mick and his campaign had no coordination of any kind with Steve Bannon or any Steve Bannon group before, during, or after this event.”

Trump's 'bigotry' appears to consist of confronting social ills instead of ignoring them

Texto completo: In his latest piece, the formerly insightful New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall asks, in earnest, “Can Democrats diminish the bigotry that Donald Trump has unleashed in this country?”
Edsall doesn’t list any examples of the “bigotry” that Trump has “unleashed in this country,” but he does say that “efforts on the left challenge the long history of Republican success in exploiting race and a host of ancillary issues — crime, welfare, social disorder, family breakdown, [and] homelessness.”
So there’s your indicator of what it means to “unleash” bigotry: to address any issue at all that would make life better for everyone — particularly for racial and ethnic minorities, who are disproportionately victims of crime, family breakdown, and social disorder.
Nobody blames minorities for crime, welfare, social disorder, family breakdown, or homelessness. But if those issues tend to afflict minority populations at a much higher rate, then that’s not a reason to stop addressing these problems — to write them off as unfortunate, permanent ills that are never to be confronted.
Talk about “the soft bigotry of low expectations.”
Liberals, who have increasingly become a mob governed by the sick ideology of social justice, only ever have one answer to any societal problem in America, and it’s to dump more money into lost causes. Dump more money into the broken public school system. (We spend more money per student than almost any other advanced country.) Dump more money into food stamps and Section 8 housing. Dump more money into accommodating anyone who wants to cross our southern border illegally.
None of that is meant to "fix" the problems. Fixing them is racist. This is all meant to accommodate these problems.
It’s like in 2018, when the Council of the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize Metro transit system fare evasion. Rather than having police apprehend freeloading riders for breaking the law, miscreants were simply handed a ticket that no one bothered to check if it was paid. This was the result of a liberal “civil rights group” study that found 91% of court summons for fare evasion were issued to black people — in a city that is predominantly black.
Do we need Andrew Yang here to “talk about math”?
At the time he voted for decriminalization, Councilman Robert White Jr., a Democrat, said, “I’m sad that’s Metro’s losing money, but I’m more sad about what’s happening to black people.”
This is the only attitude liberals accept as caring and kind. The only option is to accommodate suffering, failure, and bad behavior. Don't set any standards for people. That wouldn't be fair.
And of course, Trump is a “bigot” for talking about these issues. Edsall is an idiot if he buys into a worldview that claims any problem in America that remotely touches on race can’t be addressed.

Texto completo: President Trump's reelection campaign Wednesday filed suit against the New York Times, accusing the paper of libel for an article it published related to Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The suit, filed in the New York State Supreme Court, marks a new escalation in Trump's various fights with the media. The purpose of the litigation, the campaign said in a statement, was to "hold the news organization accountable for intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump's campaign."
The lawsuit claims the newspaper "knowingly published false and defamatory statements" in a story about the Trump campaign published March 27, 2019, alleging "an overarching deal" with "Vladimir Putin's oligarchy" against rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election — an arrangement that would deliver “a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration’s burdensome economic sanctions.”
The paper published the claims in a bid to knowingly "misinform and mislead" readers and influence the upcoming general election, the suit claims.
A spokesperson for the New York Times shared the following statement:
"The Trump Campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable. Fortunately, the law protects the rights of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance. We look forward to vindicating that right in this case."
The article was written by Max Frankel, the executive editor of the New York Times from 1986 to 1994.
The president is highly sensitive to claims that his victory in 2016 was aided by Russian interference and to suggestions that the Kremlin plans to boost his incumbent campaign ahead of November.
Trump's fraught relationship with the media, and with the New York Times in particular, has been on display since the longtime New York City property developer and media personality first entered the race.
In 2016, he threatened similar action, demanding that the paper retract a story about two women who said they were sexually harassed by the then-Republican nominee.
In 2017, after the New York Times ran a story that predicted press secretary Sean Spicer's firing, a Trump insider told the Washington Examiner that the president had written the paper off.
"Fuck the New York Times," Trump is reported to have said at the time. "They're not our friends. We're never going to win them over."
Spicer was not fired at the time but did resign two months after the piece was published.

Texto completo: As Bernie Sanders tries to cement his lead in the Democratic primaries, a small but vocal group of traditionalist Catholics have thrown their support behind the socialist's presidential bid.
"I will almost certainly vote for Bernie in the general if he's the nominee," Maryland resident John-Paul Teti told the Washington Examiner, "and I will vote for Trump if it's any other Democrat."
Teti is among a group of young, Latin Mass-going Catholics who have veered from their peers' more commonly conservative political opinions by supporting Sanders. In their view, the Vermont senator promotes the most cogent vision of the "common good" available to Catholic voters through policies such as Medicare for All, support for unions, and wealth taxes.
When their critics suggest Christianity and socialism don’t mix, these Catholics often deploy the words Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI wrote in a 2006 essay for the Christian journal First Things: "Democratic socialism was and is close to Catholic social doctrine and has, in any case, made a remarkable contribution to the formation of a social consciousness."
But, even as some Catholic Church leaders may look kindly on socialism, the Church condemns abortion rights, gay marriage, and transgender rights, all of which are nonnegotiable positions for Sanders, and, in recent months, Sanders has become increasingly vocal in his support for abortion, tweeting in January, during the March for Life, "Abortion is healthcare."
Teti carried a sign at the March for Life, reading, "Medicare for all, abortion for none," drawing the ire of the free market group the Acton Institute.
Tweet
Teti said that Sanders’s support for abortion is disappointing and that he would "do anything" to see Sanders become anti-abortion while maintaining his economic positions. That sentiment draws on the thoughts of several Catholic pundits, prominently Elizabeth Bruenig, who has argued since 2014 that anti-abortion positions and socialism are well suited to each other because both ideologies see life as "so significant, so inherently valuable, so irreplaceable that it should be the central subject of political concern." Bruenig, a columnist at the New York Times, is pro-Sanders.
In a defense of Sanders in the National Catholic Reporter, Arab American Institute President James Zogby argued that, even with his flaws, a President Sanders would "help to create a more compassionate government that sees healthcare and education as human rights."
Zogby told the Washington Examiner that, while he is a "pro-life Democrat" and disagrees with Sanders vehemently on abortion, he finds much good in a "broad array" of Sanders’s other proposals.
"Bernie is the most principled, most honest, and most compassionate candidate," he said. "As a Catholic, when I hear him speak, I hear the Sermon on the Mount."
Zogby expressed concern that abortion has become too much of a political weapon for both Republicans and Democrats. Both the anti-abortion and pro-abortion movements, Zogby said, have presented visions that are "too narrow" of why the issue matters.
"We're not going to solve this issue in this election or any election coming up soon," he said. "I am hopeful that we will continue to grow a broader understanding of what a pro-life movement should be."
Kevin Gallagher, a Catholic Sanders supporter from New York City, argued that the Democratic front-runner's position on abortion is a nonissue as far as electoral politics are concerned. For him, Sanders represents the most pragmatic choice among a field of candidates whose positions do not line up with Catholic teaching.
Neither Sanders nor Trump, Gallagher said, greatly affect policy on abortion, except on the "margins."
These margins include measures such as the Hyde Amendment, an anti-abortion policy barring federally funded abortions, along with a series of other policies that would restrict abortion access. Sanders called for repealing the Hyde Amendment in 2016, adding that the Democratic Party must also "resist attempts by states to erect roadblocks to abortion."
But, no matter who wins in 2020, Gallagher told the Washington Examiner, abortion will still be legal and likely still funded by the federal government, state governments, or taxpayers. As long as that's the case, Gallagher said it doesn't matter much to him where that funding comes from.
"There's this 'dad' argument, which is, like, 'I don’t want my taxpayer money funding this stuff. It's bad enough that it happens. I don’t want my taxpayer money funding it,'" he said. "Whether or not that argument is legitimate, my taxpayer money is already funding this stuff."
And, although he wishes abortion were illegal, Gallagher said he’s comfortable "rolling the dice" in believing that the choice between Trump and Sanders does not necessarily mean a choice between a country with or without abortion. In doing so, he said he prevents himself from becoming a single-issue voter simply because Republicans tend more toward anti-abortion positions than Democrats.
"We're not really talking about a different type of abortion regime," he said. "We're talking about one where slightly different funding sources are available in different places."
"The difference between Trump and Bernie on the abortion rate would turn out to be very small, if there at all," Teti said, adding that he believes that most Republicans are just as deaf to the anti-abortion cause as the majority of Democrats.
Catholic support for Sanders represents the latest manifestation of a historic diversity among Catholic voters. The majority support former Vice President Joe Biden in 2020, with Sanders coming in second, according to a survey conducted in February by RealClearResearch and the Catholic television network EWTN. The same poll found that Catholics are also divided on key issues, with a slim majority saying that abortion should be legal and sizable majorities saying that abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide are not "intrinsically evil."
Although internally divided, as a group, Catholics have voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election since 1972. In 2016, Trump received 52% of the vote to Clinton’s 45%, according to the Pew Research Center. Trump derives the majority of his support from devout Catholics, almost 60% of whom say they will vote for him in 2020, RealClearResearch and EWTN found.
Among the remainder of those who aren’t completely behind Trump, their reasons are often more complicated than simply outright support for any particular Democratic candidate. Zac Mabry, a star of the 1994 Little Rascals movie, told the Washington Examiner that he will vote for Sanders on Super Tuesday but that the senator’s "unacceptable" support for abortion will make it impossible to support him in a general election if he wins the nomination.
Still, Mabry said, as a Catholic, he believes Sanders’s vision of the "common good" expressed through Medicare for All is a good direction for the Democratic Party to be led.
"He doesn't care about people who are unborn, but he does care about the well-being of average, everyday people once they've been born, and that's a huge departure from what we've been getting in terms of politicians, as of late," Mabry said.

'Can't let other people take away your power or your voice': Katie Hill to publish memoir

Texto completo: Former Democratic Rep. Katie Hill is set to release a memoir following last year's controversy with leaked nude photographs and a House Ethics Committee investigation that ended her career in Congress.
She Will Rise will be part memoir, part gender-equity battle plan, according to a report by the New York Times. It is scheduled to be published by Grand Central Publishing on Aug. 18, 2020, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.
Hill resigned from Congress on Oct. 27, 2019, after stories circulated revealing alleged affairs with both a female and male aide. She admitted to a "throuple" relationship between her, her husband at the time, and the female aide, but denied any relationship with a male staffer.
In her farewell speech on the House floor, the 32-year-old California Democrat blamed her now ex-husband, Kenny Heslep, and Republican operatives for the release of the nude photographs without her consent. She also assigned blame to "gutter politics" and a "double standard" for women in explaining why she was resigning.
This message will reportedly be echoed in the memoir. Hill wants to "be part of the fight to create the change" young girls need, as she wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times.
Hill has not shied away from politics in her time out of office. She recently started HER Time, an organization with a mission to empower and elect women and young people into office.
Tweet
Anna Sproul-Latimer, Hill's literary agent and representative of several other women who have spoken out about gender discrimination and sexual harassment, said she hopes to empower writers whose voices are not often heard.
"My clients all share a sense that they really want to change the story of the world in some way," she said.
"It would be much easier for me to just disappear, but I'm not, and this is an act of defiance, staying in the forefront," Hill said. "You can't let other people take away your power or your voice, even when it's hard."

What the Boston Globe’s Warren endorsement gets woefully wrong

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign isn’t going how she would have hoped. The Massachusetts Democrat has underwhelmed in the first three primary contests, and she isn’t expected to do well in South Carolina this Saturday, either. Her campaign is in do-or-die mode, so her supporters are going all-out.
Now, the Boston Globe, New England’s most influential newspaper, is throwing its weight behind Warren in an attempt to keep her candidacy alive. The only problem? The paper’s editorial board makes a terribly flimsy argument for Warren in its endorsement and overlooks several of the candidate’s biggest flaws.
The Boston Globe says it would prefer any of the Democratic candidates to President Trump, but that “one candidate stands out as a leader with the qualifications, the track record, and the tenacity to defend the principles of democracy, bring fairness to an economy that is excluding too many Americans, and advance a progressive agenda. She would fight the corruption and corporate influence that distort our politics, lift up working families, and combat gun violence and climate change. That candidate is Elizabeth Warren.”
Why does it back Warren over her competitors? Well, the paper cites her promise that she would “make battling corruption her signature legislative initiative before tackling any other” and argues this is “a worthy cause — a root evil worth going to the mat for — in an era of historic dysfunction in Congress.”
So, too, the Boston Globe peddles the narrative that Warren is an ultrawonk with serious plans suited to the challenges of the presidency. “She consistently advocates for policies that have a firm backbone of empirical research and financial analysis,” the paper argues. “[Her plans] are grounded in the documented success of policies here in Massachusetts.”
It paints a fantasy image of policy wonk Warren, the anti-corruption crusader, fighting to get money out of Washington and full of detailed plans to implement in office.
In fact, Warren has no credibility when it comes to fighting corruption or money in politics. Her signature plan, to put a tax on lobbying, is blatantly unconstitutional and would restrict an explicit First Amendment right. How can a candidate be an effective anti-corruption wonk when her biggest proposal to address the issue (much like her proposed wealth tax) is both unconstitutional and unlikely ever to become law?
And Warren’s got a serious hypocrisy problem when it comes to money in politics, too.
The socialist-lite senator slammed her fellow competitor Pete Buttigieg and insisted that she doesn’t take big-money donations or host fundraisers with wealthy donors. That may be mostly true for Warren’s presidential candidacy, but she did that very same thing for years as a senator, raising much of the same money she has now transferred and used to fund her 2020 campaign.
Even the New York Times has called out Warren’s hypocrisy, publishing a piece titled “How Elizabeth Warren Raised Big Money Before She Denounced Big Money.” It reported that “Ms. Warren wooed wealthy donors for years, stockpiling money from fund-raisers, and has used $10.4 million from her 2018 Senate race to underwrite her 2020 bid.”
To top it off, Warren just last week flip-flopped on her long-standing pledge not to take super PAC money. She railed against super PACs and promised not to take “a dime of PAC money in this campaign” — until that became inconvenient, apparently.
Does the Boston Globe really think a total hypocrite like Warren can lead the way to fight money in politics?
So, too, the notion that she’s some sort of policy expert is just liberal media spin. Warren, in reality, is a fake wonk who has put out plan after plan — she’s got a plan for that! — but almost none of these plans are very well thought out. From healthcare to foreign policy to trade to taxation, Warren’s supposedly serious plans crumble when given even mildly critical examination.
Oh, and the newspaper overlooks and entirely omits mention of Warren’s biggest flaw in its glowing endorsement: her rank dishonesty. Over the course of her political career, Warren has pushed falsehoods about Bernie Sanders’s supposed sexism, lied about her father being a janitor, falsely claimed Native American heritage for years, lied about not planning on running for president, lied about her children's education, lied about taxes, and more.
Disingenuous favorable coverage from the liberal media has propped up Warren's entire candidacy. This Boston Globe endorsement is no exception.

'Dystopian future': Entire client list stolen from facial-recognition startup Clearview AI

Texto completo: A controversial company that was recently criticized for compiling billions of images downloaded from Facebook, YouTube, and Venmo said its entire client list was stolen during a security failure.
Clearview AI, a facial-recognition startup that has faced scrutiny from privacy advocates, notified customers on Wednesday that an intruder “gained unauthorized access” to its list of customers and private data associated with the number of accounts set up by users and searches within the Clearview database. The company told users the intruder was unable to compromise Clearview’s systems or network.
“If you’re a law-enforcement agency, it’s a big deal, because you depend on Clearview as a service provider to have good security, and it seems like they don’t,” Aspen Cybersecurity Group Managing Director David Forscey told the Daily Beast.
Founder Hoan Ton-That, an Australian computer whiz who once considered a modeling career after multiple startup failures, started Clearview AI after a chance meeting at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute. He founded the company with the help of former New York Daily News editor Richard Schwartz and was provided funding from venture capitalist Peter Thiel.
Law enforcement agencies were the first to show interest in the software, which could fundamentally change the way authorities monitor the public.
The Indiana State Police reported solving a murder that had been recorded on video within 20 minutes of using the app. Chuck Cohen, a former Indiana State Police captain who used the software, confirmed the suspect had never appeared in any government database because he didn't have a license and had never committed a crime.
The massive image database has also provided authorities with a way to identify victims of sexual abuse, with one unnamed Canadian official calling it "the biggest breakthrough in the last decade" for investigating such crimes.
Privacy advocates have bristled at the alarming pace that facial-recognition databases are being built and the realization that police will utilize the tools as surveillance on the public in the future. But David Scalzo, an early investor in Clearview AI, said it's impossible to turn back the technological advancements currently being created and that privacy laws will have to adapt with the coming times.
“I’ve come to the conclusion that because information constantly increases, there’s never going to be privacy,” Scalzo told the New York Times. “Laws have to determine what’s legal, but you can’t ban technology. Sure, that might lead to a dystopian future or something, but you can’t ban it.”
Clearview AI's attorney Tor Ekeland said the company's servers were never accessed but that "unfortunately, data breaches are a part of life."

Texto completo: Why can’t the media get it straight when it comes to the question of when human life begins?
I don’t believe that reporters and editors at the largest media outlets botch their facts out of deliberate dishonesty. The two most likely explanations are: (A) They just don’t care to try and overcome their bias, or (B) they do try, but their bias and the bubble they live in are so strong that they fail.
Check out the coverage of Tuesday’s debate over two pro-life bills that the Democrats successfully filibustered.
Keep in mind that one of these pro-life bills was not an actual abortion restriction. The Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act merely requires doctors and hospitals to treat babies who survive abortions and are born alive as patients. CNN claims that the Senate was debating “two abortion restriction bills.” But it is not an “abortion restriction” to say that a child who is already born must be cared for.
Do CNN editors not know what the bill would do, or do they believe that letting a living, already born baby die counts as an abortion?
If that latter possibility sounds insane, consider how CNN describes such a baby. CNN says the bill “would require abortion providers to work to 'preserve the life and health' of a fetus that was born following an attempted abortion as they would for a newborn baby, or face up to five years in prison.”
“A fetus that was born,” as Alexandra DeSanctis points out, is also known as “a baby.”
Every single person you know is a “fetus that was born.” Caroline Kelly, the CNN reporter who wrote this piece, is a “fetus that was born," just as every senator who refused to allow a vote on this measure is a fetus that was born.
What the bill would do is require a doctor to treat a person born after an attempted abortion the same as it would treat a person born not after an attempted abortion.
The New York Times says the bill would “threaten some doctors who perform [abortions] with criminal penalties.” That’s literally true but entirely misleading. The only abortionists to face criminal penalties would be those who fail to terminate a baby in utero and then also refuse to provide or order care for the living baby born as a result.
The New York Times's “threaten … with criminal penalties” language is as sensible as saying malpractice laws “threaten some doctors who care for women with legal penalties.”
In another bit of misleading sleight of hand, the New York Times says “late-term abortions” are “exceedingly rare” because “abortions after 20 weeks accounted for 1.2% of abortions in 2016.”
Considering that 623,471 abortions were reported, 1.2% is more than 7,400 late-term abortions. Is that exceedingly rare? That’s 140 every week. There are twice as many late-term abortions in the United States as there are children or teens killed or injured by firearms in the U.S. The New York Times does not call it “exceedingly rare” for children or teens to be shot in the U.S.

If you administered truth serum, probably 90% of the accredited press in the U.S. would say they want abortion legal in most or all cases. If you looked through the sources and contacts and wedding guests of most reporters and editors at major publications, you would find tons of Planned Parenthood, SKD Knickerbocker, and EMILY's List names among them. The average reporter lives in the same ecosystem as the average abortion lobbyist and Planned Parenthood flack.
The result is very slanted coverage of abortion that misleads readers about the facts but informs the knowledgeable readers about media bias.

Texto completo: An Arizona newspaper announced it would no longer endorse candidates for public office.
The Arizona Republic on Monday explained its decision, which it said was under consideration for several years. The newspaper said focus groups and online surveys revealed that "endorsements alienate [readers] and blur the way they view our news stories." Tweet
The Phoenix-based publication made headlines during the 2016 presidential election when for the first time in its 126 year history it recommended a Democratic presidential candidate.
The importance of disagreeing with others in "responsible ways" was another point brought up within the article.
"In the months and years to come, The Republic Opinions pages will fight to preserve the public space for responsible people to express their views," the organization said. "We will defend speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment and challenge those individuals and political movements that would deny them."
"This newspaper is stepping back from picking sides in candidate elections, but we won’t stand down from our important role of encouraging, inspiring and leading the important discussions essential to a free society and a better community."
This is the second news organization in the past 10 days to break from tradition. On Feb. 16, the Dallas Morning News announced that instead of making a presidential recommendation or choosing one candidate, it will "endorse ideas" and "offer a vision for the country."
Tweet
Meanwhile, the New York Times plans to be more "transparent" in their endorsement process this year. The paper made its candidate interview process public. The editorial board decided to endorse Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar, a rare instance of splitting its ticket on endorsements. Klobuchar also won the backing of several New England newspaper editorial boards.
Despite the significant endorsements, Klobuchar came in third behind fellow candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the New Hampshire primary.

Texto completo: 2020 Democrat Joe Biden's campaign is walking back the former vice president's claim that he was arrested while trying to see South African leader Nelson Mandela in prison.
Biden, 77, made the claim during campaign events earlier this month despite not mentioning it in his 2007 memoir, which included details about his trips to South Africa in the 1970s. The New York Times additionally couldn't find any reference to his arrest in the paper's archives.
His deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield attempted to clarify the story on Tuesday after the campaign declined to answer questions on the remarks, which were rebutted by former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young.
“He was separated from his party at the airport,” Bedingfield explained, referring to when the former vice president was separated from black colleagues in Johannesburg on a congressional trip to South Africa in the 1970s.
“It was a separation," she added. "They, he was not allowed to go through the same door that the — the rest of the party he was with. Obviously, it was apartheid South Africa. There was a white door, there was a black door. He did not want to go through the white door and have the rest of the party go through the black door. He was separated. This was during a trip while they were there in Johannesburg.”
Biden told a crowd during a campaign event in South Carolina earlier this week, “I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robben Island.”
The story echoed another one he recalled on the campaign trail last week.
“After he got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office,” Biden said of Mandela at a brunch in Las Vegas at the time. “He threw his arms around me and said, ‘I want to say thank you.’ I said, ‘What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?’ He said, ‘You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.’”

Acting intelligence chief Richard Grenell to keep official who infuriated Trump over Russia testimony

Texto completo: The intelligence community's top election security official will stay on despite angering President Trump by telling lawmakers that Russia was intervening in the 2020 election — in his favor.
The decision to keep election security coordinator Shelby Pierson is seen as an attempt to reassure intelligence officials, some of whom are concerned that newly acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell, a close Trump ally, will politicize intelligence. Grenell axed his deputy on his first day in the position, drawing concern that his efforts to "clean house" would shape a partisan intelligence service that would bend to the president's will.
Pierson said she had discussed election security with Grenell on several occasions since he was appointed.
"Ambassador Grenell has not asked me to leave," Pierson told the New York Times on Tuesday. Rather, Pierson said, Grenell "encouraged and affirmed his support for my position here in the organization. I have not asked to depart nor discussed resignation in any way."
Trump heard details of Pierson's Feb. 13 briefing to the House Intelligence Committee and was unhappy that he was again said to be favored by the Russian government. The Russia motif led to Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign, a "witch hunt" in the president's telling.
Trump challenged the claims of interference during a press conference in India on Monday, calling them "highly exaggerated."
According to the New York Times, some administration aides worried that the official responsible for the classified meeting would be fired. In a matter of days, Trump broached the issue with then-acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire before replacing him with political ally Grenell, who was at the time the U.S. ambassador to Germany.
But Grenell has stood by the official, whose hearing was supposed to reinforce the administration's assertion that American election systems are secure in spite of foreign influence campaigns on social media targeting voters. A February op-ed signed by senior administration officials Attorney General William Barr, FBI chief Christopher Wray, and others made a similar point, detailing the steps that agencies and states were taking to protect the election and calling on voters to stay informed.

'There will be more coming': Trump signals additional libel lawsuits after suing New York Times

Texto completo: There could be other lawsuits coming against newsrooms from the White House.
During a press conference on Wednesday night, President Trump was asked about his libel lawsuit against the New York Times over an opinion piece published on March 27 that accused him of working with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump doubled down on his support for filing a libel lawsuit over opinion pieces and claimed he may file more in the future.
“Well, when they get their opinion totally wrong, as the New York Times did, and, frankly, they've got a lot wrong over the last number of years, so we’ll let that work its way through the courts,” Trump said.
He added, “If you read it, you’ll see it’s beyond an opinion. That’s not an opinion. That’s something much more than an opinion. They did a bad thing, and there will be more coming.”
The president's lawsuit said the New York Times "knowingly published false and defamatory statements" about him, including unsubstantiated accusations that the White House had "an overarching deal" with "Vladimir Putin's oligarchy" to start “a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration’s burdensome economic sanctions.”
A representative from the New York Times said, "The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable. Fortunately, the law protects the rights of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance. We look forward to vindicating that right in this case."

Clive Cussler, million-selling adventure writer, dies at 88

Texto completo: New York • Clive Cussler, the million-selling adventure writer and real-life thrill-seeker who wove personal details and spectacular fantasies into his page-turning novels about underwater explorer Dirk Pitt, has died, his publisher said Wednesday.
Cussler died Monday at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, said Alexis Welby, spokeswoman for publisher Penguin Random House. He was 88. The cause was not disclosed.
Cussler dispatched Pitt and pal Al Giordino on exotic missions highlighted by shipwrecks, treachery, espionage and beautiful women, in popular works including "Cyclops,'' “Night Probe!” and his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!"
Cussler was an Illinois native who was raised in Southern California and lived in Arizona for most of his final years, but he sent Pitt around the globe in plots that ranged from the bold to the incredible. "The Treasure" features an aspiring Aztec despot who murders an American envoy, the hijacking of a plane carrying the United Nations secretary-general and soldiers from ancient Rome looting the Library of Alexandria. In "Iceberg," the presidents of French Guiana and the Dominican Republic are the ones in danger, during a visit to Disneyland. In "Sahara," a race across the desert somehow leads to new information about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
"Again and again, Dirk Pitt, working for the fictional National Underwater and Marine Agency, must find a sunken vessel and retrieve some artifact," Mark Schone, summarizing Cussler's novels, wrote in The New York Times in 2004. “Evil forces, be they Commies or Blofeldian madmen, try to stop him. Along the way Pitt saves himself, the world and the damsel of the moment."
Cussler has a new novel, “Journey of the Pharaohs," set to be released March 10, with several more awaiting posthumous publication.
In real life, Cussler founded his own National Underwater and Marine Agency and participated in dozens of searches for old ships, including one that turned up a steamship belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt. He also had a long history of questionable claims — some admitted, some denied.
"He can definitely spin the tall tales and is a master of fiction. But that doesn't mean I buy into his alleged discovery claims," Dr. E. Lee Spence wrote on his blog in 2011. Spence, a prominent underwater archaeologist feuded with Cussler over which of them recovered a Confederate submarine.
Born an only child in 1931 in Aurora, Illinois, and raised in Alhambra, California, Cussler's name and writing persona have the air of a pseudonym, but he was born with his moniker, named for the British actor Clive Brook. He studied for two years at Pasadena City College before enlisting in the Air Force and serving as a mechanic and flight engineer during the Korean War.
In 1955, he married Barbara Knight, with whom he had three children. Through much of the 1960s, he worked in advertising, as a copywriter and creative director. Among the better known slogans he helped coin — "It's stronger than dirt," for an Ajax laundry detergent campaign.
In his free time, he was writing fiction and moonlighting at a skin-diving equipment shop, where his wife suggested he work to help gather material for his novels.
“When creating advertising, I had always looked at the competition and wondered what I could conceive that was totally different,” Cussler said in an interview included in "Dirk Pitt Revealed," a nonfiction book released in 1998. "(James) Bond was becoming incredibly popular through the movies, and I knew I couldn't match Ian Fleming's style and prose. So I was determined not to write about a detective, secret agent or undercover investigator or deal in murder mysteries. My hero's adventures would be based on and under water."
Cussler finished manuscripts for "Mediterranean Caper" and "Iceberg," but had no literary agent: so he created one. He purchased a thousand sheets of blank letter paper, got a friend in advertising to design a logo for "The Charles Winthrop Agency" and sent his first inquiry to Peter Lampack of the William Morris Agency. Lampack agreed to take on Cussler and remained with him long after the author confessed his charade.
"I told him the story of Charlie Winthrop with great trepidation," Cussler explained to the Arizona Republic. "I sat there waiting for the result, and he sat there blank for a minute, and then he laughed himself under the table. And he said, 'Oh my God. I always thought Charlie Winthrop was some guy I met while I was drunk at a cocktail party.'"
"Mediterranean Caper" came out in 1973, followed by "Iceberg" two years later and "Raise the Titanic!" in 1976. He would turn out more than 20 Dirk Pitt novels and expand into children's books and such adventure series as "The Oregon Files" and "The Numa Files."
Cussler had claimed his worldwide sales topped 100 million copies, but in a legal battle with Crusader Entertainment, which alleged he had misrepresented his popularity, it was determined the number was closer to 40 million. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded Crusader $5 million but also ordered that Cussler receive $8.5 million because the film company only adapted one ("Sahara") of the two books it had agreed to produce.
The film version of "Sahara" came out in 2005 and starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz. An adaptation of “Raise the Titanic!” — its title the same except for dropping the exclamation point, came out in 1980 and featured Jason Robards and Alec Guinness.
In recent years, Cussler began working with co-authors and collaborated with his son on "Poseidon's Arrow," "Crescent Dawn" and "Arctic Drift." Cussler's son is Dirk Cussler. Pitt himself had a son, called, of course, Dirk Pitt Jr.
In addition to Dirk Cussler, the author is survived by his second wife, Janet, daughters Teri and Dayna, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: With Bernie Sanders romping in Nevada, we come to it again. The insurgent candidate, armored against normal political forces and equipped with a passionate following, leads a field of more conventional party politicians. His early-state successes have given him a clear path to a plurality of pledged convention delegates. And his rivals are dividing the votes that might derail him while what remains of the party establishment day by day proves itself irrelevant.
As with Donald Trump in 2016, so with Sanders so far in 2020. The characters are different, but the same dynamics are in play.
The Democratic Party, no less than the Republican Party, looks like a derelict ship awaiting capture by a band of pirates. The center-left establishment, no less than its GOP counterpart, seems old, exhausted, promising to mildly reform a status quo that an intense and motivated portion of its base regards as too decadent to be worth preserving. And the party actors who don’t want to see Sanders nominated are finding, like NeverTrumpers before them, that it’s awfully hard to stop a candidate if you can’t agree on the alternative.
The repetition is far enough advanced that a replay of 2016 may be inevitable. But there’s still time for conservatives who opposed Trump to offer some advice to Democrats who want to nominate someone other than the Vermont socialist.
So here are three lessons for PleaseNotBernie from the wreckage that was NeverTrump:
You need candidates who aren’t actually winning primaries to drop out.
The fatal conceit of establishment politicians facing an insurgency is that because the insurgent has obvious weaknesses, they should hang around and hang around, piling up third-place finishes and minor delegate hauls, in the hopes of gaining ... something. What they are actually likely to gain is blame, irrelevance or both; just ask those noted influencers Jeb Bush and John Kasich.
So if you are, say, Amy Klobuchar, the fact that you have a solid case for your own electability is not a reason to stick around for Super Tuesday if you finish behind Pete Buttigieg in South Carolina as well as in Nevada. If you’re Buttigieg, your strong Iowan and New Hampshire performances aren’t a reason to stay in if it’s clear you can’t compete nationally with Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden. If you’re Biden, if you lose South Carolina you should drop out the next day. And so on.
None of this means that simply consolidating the field will stop Bernie; he might well win a head-to-head race, too. But giving him five or six opponents in every contest makes the solidity of his core support an insurmountable advantage. And if you can narrow the field, the second lesson comes into play.
Against an unconventional front-runner, unconventional measures are required.
In the case of Trump, the person most willing to think this way was Ted Cruz, who made a serious bid to induce Marco Rubio to join him in an anti-Trump unity ticket. Would this have ultimately worked? Quite possibly not, but it was a brighter idea than the path that Rubio ultimately took — passionately bemoaning Trump’s ascent but refusing to gamble boldly in response.
There isn’t an obvious unity ticket equivalent for the non-Sanders Democrats, but the dynamic between Bloomberg, Biden and Buttigieg is worth watching. They are all positioned as moderate alternatives to the Sanders revolution, and after South Carolina and Super Tuesday one of them may look a lot more viable than the others. In which case two of the B’s swiftly dropping out and just as swiftly campaigning and fundraising for (or simply funding, in Bloomberg’s case) the third might be the only chance at a not-Sanders consolidation. And that chance is worth taking because of the third lesson.
You probably can’t stop a plurality candidate at a contested convention.
And that’s especially true if he has a clear delegate lead. I spent the early months of 2016 arguing otherwise, but the party system I was defending is pretty obviously dead. There’s little stomach among party officialdom to work against a candidate who wins the most primary votes, and voters themselves are unlikely to sustain rival candidacies if they’re clearly just playing for a brokered convention.
I suspect that this is what doomed Cruz, in the end: Between his victory in Wisconsin and his campaign-ending defeat in Indiana, part of the anti-Trump coalition seemed to become exhausted by the idea of a convention fight that at best would end with Trump trying to split the party and voted strategically to end the race early instead.
The Democrats’ delegate apportionment rules do make a contested convention more likely, but Bernie is better-liked by most Democrats than Trump was by Republicans at this stage in ’16. So my bet is that history will repeat itself: A world where Sanders is on track to get a clear delegate plurality in late March is probably a world where he gets a majority by May.
Which means that the long game of delegate accumulation and superdelegate machination is probably irrelevant, and the only question is whether it’s possible to unite a not-Sanders vote across the first three Tuesdays in March.
To quote an ancient NeverTrump proverb: Good luck with that.

Texto completo: The Christian season of Lent, a time of repentance and reflection, is upon us. The weeks that begin with Ash Wednesday culminate in Holy Week, a commemoration of the Passover feast in roughly the year A.D. 33, during which Jesus triumphantly entered Jerusalem, was condemned and crucified by the Roman authorities, and — in the Christian understanding of the world — rose from the dead.
In the words of an Anglican prayer for the 40 days of Lent, believers implore the Lord to “come quickly to help us who are assaulted by many temptations; and, as you know the weaknesses of each of us, let each one find you mighty to save.”
Given the state of the nation two millenniums on, it is difficult to conceive of something more counterintuitive than the Christian ideal. For many Americans, especially non-Christians, the thought that Christian morality is a useful guide to much of anything these days is risible, particularly since so many evangelicals have thrown in their lot with a relentlessly solipsistic American president who bullies, boasts and sneers. The political hero of the Christian right of 2020 has used the National Prayer Breakfast to mock the New Testament injunction to love one’s enemies, and it’s clear that leading conservative Christian voices are putting the Supreme Court ahead of the Sermon on the Mount.
And yet history suggests that religiously inspired activism may hold the best hope for those in resistance to the prevailing Trumpian order.
I’ve come to this view in publishing a small book of reflections on the last sayings of Jesus from the cross — a devotional exercise, to be sure, but one that’s brought to mind the motive force of a Christian message based not on Fox News but on what those first-century words meant then and can mean now. “Father, forgive them”; “Assuredly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise”; “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit” — these remarks from the Gospel accounts of the Passion form a kind of final sermon from Jesus, one about forbearance, duty, love and mercy.
I am a Christian (a very poor one, but there we are), but I am also a historian, and contemplating the beginnings of the story of my ancestral faith has led me to think about the uses of Jesus down the eons. Yes, Christianity has been an instrument of repression, but in the living memory of Americans it has also been deployed as a means of liberation and progress — which feeds the hope that it can become a force for good once more.
The secular wish to banish religion from the public square is perennial but doomed; one might as well try to eliminate economic, geographic or partisan concerns. “All men,” Homer wrote, “have need of the gods,” and the more productive task is to manage and marshal the effects of religious feeling on the broader republic. “In ages of faith the final aim of life is placed beyond life,” Alexis de Tocqueville said in “Democracy in America,” written in the Age of Jackson. “The men of these ages,” he added, “learn by insensible degrees to repress a multitude of petty, passing desires.”
Don’t take my word for it. Take, instead, that of John Lewis and of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., men whose Christian belief brought America to account on the question of domestic apartheid just over a half century ago. Their words and actions can be traced directly from the words and actions of Jesus. King’s vision was grounded in both the Bible and in Gandhi. “It was the Sermon on the Mount, rather than a doctrine of passive resistance, that initially inspired the Negroes of Montgomery to dignified social action,” King recalled of the Montgomery bus boycott. “It was Jesus of Nazareth that stirred the Negroes to protest with the creative weapon of love.”
King had been deeply influenced by the theologian Walter Rauschenbusch and his 1907 book “Christianity and the Social Crisis,” which argued that Jesus called the world not simply to contemplate but to act. “The Gospel at its best deals with the whole man, not only his soul but his body, not only his spiritual well-being, but his material well-being,” King wrote in a Rauschenbusch-inspired passage. “Any religion that professes to be concerned about the souls of men and is not concerned about the slums that damn them, the economic conditions that strangle them and the social conditions that cripple them is a spiritually moribund religion awaiting burial.”
Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, was perhaps King’s most devoted disciple. Growing up in Pike County, Ala., he overcame a childhood stutter by preaching to the chickens on his parents’ tenant farm. Hearing King on the radio, Mr. Lewis was moved to action, and came to share the older minister’s philosophy of Christian nonviolence. Their inspiration came from the New Testament: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth”; “Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
As Mr. Lewis recalled, the struggle within time and space was about “Heaven and earth. This was the Social Gospel in action. This was love in action, what we came to call in our workshops soul force.” The goal? “The Beloved Community,” which was, he said, “nothing less than the Christian concept of the kingdom of God on earth.”
This was the vision that brought America to account in the mid-1960s — which was, historically speaking, the day before yesterday. It was a religious vision. One need not profess faith in traditional terms to share it, of course; no sect, no nation, has a monopoly on virtue. And as the fourth-century Roman writer Symmachus noted in arguing against Christians who wanted to remove an altar to the pagan deity Victory, “We cannot attain to so great a mystery by one way.”
I agree. But the American past unmistakably tells us that one way to a more perfect union, one way to a nation where equality before the law and before God is more universal, is the way of King and of Lewis. Which was is also the way of Jesus.
People of faith are called — again and again and again — to return to the foot of the cross. It’s a terrifying place to stand. But that is where the story Christians profess begins. It is a story about love, not loathing; generosity, not greed. In our time, the will to power has all too often overwhelmed the words of Jesus — and that is why we must hear and heed those words anew.

Ross Douthat: The coronavirus is more than a disease. It’s a test.

Texto completo: A truism of our times is that media hysteria quickly envelops every major story, with social media virality and cable-news imperatives combining to make any domestic controversy feel like Watergate, if not Fort Sumter, and any international incident feel like the assassination of Franz Ferdinand — until the next story rolls around and last week’s crisis is forgotten.
So it has been striking to watch media coverage of the coronavirus, which has now officially shaken free of its Chinese origins with outbreaks in Italy, South Korea and the Middle East, take a somewhat more muted tack these past few weeks. Of course there has been terrific reporting, much of it from my colleagues at The New York Times, on the surreal developments in the illness’s Wuhan epicenter.
But there has also been a strange lack of urgency in the arenas best known for their hysteria. Cable news has remained fixated on the presidential campaign, social media has been paranoid at the fringes but otherwise calm or even oblivious, our president (not typically one for threat de flation) expressed confidence that Chinese containment and spring warmth would suffice to halt the virus’s spread, and respectable opinion has circulated stern warnings about overreaction, xenophobia and panic.
The curious absence of hysteria probably reflects an interplay between polarization and ideological preconceptions. The political right would normally react to the menace of a viral outbreak in a major geopolitical rival with demands for quarantine and a zealous government response. But with a nationalist Republican president enjoying the benefits of a long economic expansion, there has been a strong partisan incentive to play down or ignore the seriousness of the virus’s threat to supply chains, the Dow, the country’s gross domestic product.
Liberals have partisan incentives that run the other way, toward emphasizing the White House’s unpreparedness in the face of a clear and present threat. But these incentives have so far been outweighed by liberalism’s ideological bias toward global openness, its anxiety about saying or doing anything that might give aid and comfort to anti-globalization forces, its fear of ever sounding too, well, Trump-y in the face of foreign threats. Thus the liberal instinct toward minimization: It’s not much worse than the flu, panicking makes things only worse, don’t spread conspiracy theories about its origins, racism toward Chinese people is the real danger here. …
As of this week, with the virus finally infecting the stock market, this bipartisan minimization looks like a serious mistake. The coronavirus is not a civilization-ender, not Stephen King’s Captain Trips come for us at last, but it’s increasingly obvious that we do have a lot to fear from it, both medically and economically — and the American response seems to lag substantially behind where we should want to be right now.
The reasonable medical fears center on what is unknown as much as what is known. Because this disease broke out in a totalitarian regime, under circumstances that even China’s government now admits are more uncertain than the pious certainty offered for weeks, our knowledge of infection rates and death rates has likely been corrupted from the beginning, by misinformation and ignorance alike.
We know enough to know that most people who get it will survive it, which is good news. But we don’t know how many people get infected, how long it incubates, whether spring or summer weather will actually impede its spread. We also don’t know how many people are carriers without knowing it, and thus how easily it might move along vectors that don’t require a chain of clearly sick people running back to its point of origin. (The outbreaks outside China, in Italy especially, suggest a longer incubation period and a lot more silent contagion than had been previously hoped.)
The extreme measures that have been taken to contain the disease inside China promise all kinds of global breakdowns if they endure there and spread around the world. The supply chains that now bind our world system have never been tested in a severe pandemic, and one can extrapolate forward from China’s developing economic slowdown, and from slow-building delays and shortages worldwide, to a scenario where the coronavirus finally brings the post-2008 expansion to a grinding, deglobalizing halt.
Perhaps the worst can be averted, but these scenarios have been obvious from early in the epidemic — and so has the possibility that underreaction could make things worse, that a bias toward stability and reassurance could lead to darker outcomes in the end. It wouldn’t be the first time: As Ari Schulman wrote in The New Atlantis in 2015, during the previous year’s Ebola outbreak, the CDC’s determination to reassure the public led to messaging “based on fragmentary evidence” that other evidence qualified or contradicted and left nurses caring for Ebola patients wearing only surgical masks instead of respirators; only after two nurses were infected were the guidelines changed. The World Health Organization’s response to the Ebola outbreak was delayed by fears that declaring an emergency “could anger the African countries involved, hurt their economies, or interfere with the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.”
From what we can tell, the coronavirus outbreak in China followed a similar pattern of “all is well” folly and insufficient first response. But in the United States, too, the “we have nothing to fear but fear itself” messaging seems inapt, given that America’s slow internal response, our apparent failure so far to expand testing beyond those who seem most obviously exposed, means that we have no way of knowing whether and how many cases are already circulating here. We may have an Italian scenario on our hands already, disguised as normal flu cases, normal flu deaths; given the still-limited scale of U.S. testing, there is no way to be sure, and if we escape a major outbreak, it will be more from luck than prudence.
So already, the virus has exposed a clear weak spot in what you might call the liberal-globalist imagination: an overzealous “remain calm” spirit in the face of the real risks of a hyper-connected world.
And behind that weakness lurks a structural danger for the globalist project. For the past few years there has been a lively policy debate about the wisdom of exporting so much of the American industrial base to Asia, but it’s mostly revolved around national-security questions — what would it mean in a war with China, etc. But it turns out that you don’t need a conflict in the Taiwan straits to make the entire China-U.S. economic arrangement look reckless or vulnerable or unwise; you could just need one significant mutation, of one novel flulike sickness.
But before populists crow their vindication, we need to see how our populist president handles any of this. If globalism’s weakness is technocratic naïveté, populism’s faults are ignorance, incompetence and paranoia. Nothing about President Donald Trump’s response so far instills confidence that he’s ready for the kind of crisis that Candidate Trump would have been quick to recognize and politically exploit. And the fact that Rush Limbaugh spent Monday declaring that the coronavirus is no worse than the common cold, and that it’s “being weaponized” by the press “to bring down Donald Trump” — well, that doesn’t instill confidence that pressure from the right will force Trump to take the outbreak seriously.
By coincidence I’m writing this column from an airport, about to embark (hand sanitizer in my pocket) on a small tour for a new book whose argument, in part, is that the Western world may be sustainably decadent — meaning that for all our gridlock, stagnation and decay, the cushion of our wealth, the weakness of our rivals and the tranquilizing effect of virtual entertainments make continued stagnation much more likely than true crisis or collapse.
I wasn’t expecting to have my thesis tested this directly while I’m literally out expounding on it. But make no mistake: The coronavirus is a test, targeted precisely to the globalized order’s points of fracture and the mix of misgovernment and mistrust associated with the populist-establishment stalemate in the West.
I believe in my own thesis enough to assume that we’ll muddle through, in the end, with (God willing) not too much damage, not too many deaths. But for better or worse we may know a lot more about the resilience of our world-system, the sustainability of our decadence, by the time the paperback comes out.

Texto completo: If this election turns out to be just between a self-proclaimed socialist and an undiagnosed sociopath, we will be in a terrible, terrible place as a country. How do we prevent that?
That’s all I am thinking about right now. My short answer is that the Democrats have to do something extraordinary — forge a national unity ticket the likes of which they have never forged before. And that’s true even if Democrats nominate someone other than Bernie Sanders.
What would this super ticket look like? Well, I suggest Sanders — and Michael Bloomberg, who seems to be his most viable long-term challenger — lay it out this way:
“I want people to know that if I am the Democratic nominee these will be my Cabinet choices — my team of rivals. I want Amy Klobuchar as my vice president. Her decency, experience and moderation will be greatly appreciated across America and particularly in the Midwest. I want Mike Bloomberg (or Bernie Sanders) as my secretary of the Treasury. Our plans for addressing income inequality are actually not that far apart, and if we can blend them together it will be great for the country and reassure markets. I want Joe Biden as my secretary of state. No one in our party knows the world better or has more credibility with our allies than Joe. I will ask Elizabeth Warren to serve as health and human services secretary. No one could bring more energy and intellect to the task of expanding health care for more Americans than Senator Warren.
“I want Kamala Harris for attorney general. She has the toughness and integrity needed to clean up the corrupt mess Donald Trump has created in our Justice Department. I would like Mayor Pete as homeland security secretary; his intelligence and military background would make him a quick study in that job. I would like Tom Steyer to head a new Cabinet position: secretary of national infrastructure. We’re going to rebuild America, not just build a wall on the border with Mexico. And I am asking Cory Booker, the former mayor of Newark, to become secretary of housing and urban development. Who would bring more passion to the task of revitalizing our inner cities than Cory?
“I am asking Mitt Romney to be my commerce secretary. He is the best person to promote American business and technology abroad — and it is vital that the public understands that my government will be representing all Americans , including Republicans. I would like Andrew Yang to be energy secretary, overseeing our nuclear stockpile and renewable energy innovation. He’d be awesome.
“I am asking Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to serve as our U.N. ambassador. Can you imagine how our international standing would improve with youth worldwide with her representing next-gen America? And I want Sen. Michael Bennet, the former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, to be my secretary of education. No one understands education reform better than he does. Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna would be an ideal secretary of labor, balancing robots and workers to create “new collar” jobs.
“Finally, I am asking William H. McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who commanded the U.S. Special Operations Command from 2011 to 2014 and oversaw the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden, to be my defense secretary. Admiral McRaven, more than any other retired military officer, has had the courage and integrity to speak out against the way President Trump has politicized our intelligence agencies.
Only last week, McRaven wrote an essay in The Washington Post decrying Trump’s firing of Joe Maguire as acting director of national intelligence — the nation’s top intelligence officer — for doing his job when he had an aide brief a bipartisan committee of Congress on Russia’s renewed efforts to tilt our election toward Trump.
“Edmund Burke,” wrote McRaven, “the Irish statesman and philosopher, once said: ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.’”
If Bernie or Bloomberg or whoever emerges to head the Democratic ticket brings together such a team of rivals, I am confident it will defeat Trump in a landslide. But if progressives think they can win without the moderates — or the moderates without the progressives — they are crazy. And they’d be taking a huge risk with the future of the country by trying.
And I mean a huge risk. Back in May 2018, the former House speaker John Boehner declared: “There is no Republican Party. There’s a Trump party. The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.”
It’s actually not napping anymore. It’s dead.
And I will tell you the day it died. It was just last week, when Trump sacked Maguire for advancing the truth and replaced him with a loyalist, an incompetent political hack, Richard Grenell. Grenell is the widely disliked U.S. ambassador to Germany, a post for which he is also unfit. Grenell is now purging the intelligence service of Trump critics. How are we going to get unvarnished, nonpolitical intelligence analysis when the message goes out that if your expert conclusions disagree with Trump’s wishes, you’re gone?
I don’t accept, but can vaguely understand, Republicans’ rallying around Trump on impeachment. But when Republicans, the self-proclaimed national security party — folks like Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Tom Cotton — don’t lift a finger to stop Trump’s politicization of our first line of defense — the national intelligence directorate set up after 9/11 — then the Republican Party is not asleep. It’s dead and buried.
And that is why a respected, nonpartisan military intelligence professional like Bill McRaven felt compelled to warn what happens when good people are silent in the face of evil. Our retired generals don’t go public like that very often. But he was practically screaming, “This is a four-alarm fire, a category 5 hurricane.” And the GOP response? Silence.
Veteran political analyst E.J. Dionne, in his valuable new book, “Code Red: How Progressives and Moderates Can Unite to Save Our Country,” got this exactly right: We have no responsible Republican Party anymore. It is a deformed Trump personality cult. If the country is going to be governed responsibly, that leadership can come only from Democrats and disaffected Republicans courageous enough to stand up to Trump. It is crucial, therefore, argues Dionne, that moderate and progressive Democrats find a way to build a governing coalition together.
Neither can defeat the other. Neither can win without the other. Neither can govern without the other.
If they don’t join together — if the Democrats opt for a circular firing squad — you can kiss the America you grew up in goodbye.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has sent a clear message to America's intelligence community: Providing an honest assessment of Russia's election meddling to Congress can end your career. Just ask Joseph Maguire, the former director of national intelligence, fired days after permitting a subordinate to provide just such an honest assessment. Maguire was replaced with unqualified Trump sycophant Richard Grenell, a former ambassador whose first order of business has been to fill the ranks with others like him: those willing to say only what Trump wants to hear.
As congressional Republicans made clear during the impeachment hearings, they're willing to rationalize almost any level of presidential misbehavior to avoid rebuking Trump. Then, it was the rule of law that was compromised. Now, it's the very security of the United States. And yet the GOP continues to shield Trump -- not just from accountability but from reality. Where does this end?
As The New York Times revealed, intelligence officials earlier this month warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaigns with an eye toward aiding Trump's reelection. Republicans in the room reportedly were furious -- not that America's top geopolitical foe is again trying to undermine U.S. elections, but at intelligence officials' conclusions that the meddling was designed to help Trump. Why would that be, they wanted to know, when Trump has been so tough on Russia? Only in their alternate universe can Trump be regarded as tough on Russia.
When he withheld military aid to Ukraine to advance his personal political interests, Trump served Russian military goals. Trump's impulsive (if short-lived) order to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria last year was exactly what Russia wanted. Trump's frequent tiffs with allies and open criticism of NATO seemed scripted from the Kremlin's wish list. Then there's Trump's consistent and chillingly strange refusal to ever directly confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin -- even when prompted to choose between Putin and U.S. intelligence.
All this, yet congressional Republicans say it makes no sense that Putin would want another four years of Trump in office? It makes perfect sense.
For a look at how responsible public officials handle these awkward situations, consider Bernie Sanders. The same intelligence has concluded Russia is meddling to help him secure the Democratic presidential nomination. Whether that's because Russia thinks Sanders would be a weak president, or beatable by Trump in November, Moscow's support isn't exactly flattering. Yet Sanders issued a strong statement condemning not the U.S. messengers, but the Kremlin -- something Trump has so far been unable to make himself do.
The president's defenders insist that Russian meddling isn't meant to help Trump but to generally sow chaos in America's political system. Have they considered that, even if that is the only goal, Trump's reelection would serve it well?

WILL WE REPEAT THE FALSE EQUIVALENCY NIGHTMARE OF 2016?

Texto completo: For those who suffer every day from Donald Trump's influence on our once recognizable nation, there is this solace.
Trump appears even more miserable than we are.
That was my central takeaway from the meticulous chronological account of his presidency by a pair of Pulitzer-winning Washington Post reporters. Carol Leonnig and Phil Rucker talked to more than 200 sources for their book, "A Very Stable Genius," playing off Trump's revealing self-description.
In their account, it seems Trump has spent hours most days as president watching Fox News and other television, fixated on how his personal brand fares at the moment. Rather than thoughtfully leading the country in perilous times, his obsession is to punish not only perceived enemies, from Nancy Pelosi to our top military and civilian leaders, but to mercilessly belittle his own people.
He comes across as more unhappy in the job than many Americans are that he has it, if that's possible.
One Trump subordinate after another lacks "the look" of defiant macho strength he covets in those who defend him. They are weak, ineffectual. Think Jeff Sessions, Trump's former attorney general.
Others are insufficiently deferential. Think Rex Tillerson, former secretary of state, or John Kelly, former chief of staff.
Fulminating about how everyone else fails to measure up to his awesomeness, Trump comes across as profoundly cruel, but also as lazy and ignorant.
The book described how Kelly would be picked up at his Virginia home by the Secret Service for the commute at 4 a.m. every morning, reading newspapers on the drive. Trump would saunter down from his White House quarters to start his day between 11 a.m. and noon.
And ignorant? On a stopover at Pearl Harbor, Trump was on a tour and seemed to know almost nothing about the 1941 attack by Japan that brought the United States into World War II.
Also described was how Trump told the prime minister of India: "It's not like you've got China on your border." Except that, well, he does. The prime minister's eyes bulged out, said a witness, and the authors noted the anecdote as one example of Trump's "stunning ignorance" of geography.
The book, which portrays Trump as more mob boss than president, concludes after his false claim of exoneration by the Mueller report and his call to Ukraine that drove the impeachment inquiry.
Trump is even more the mob boss now, as he punishes those who testified against him and shreds the judicial system.
As I powered off my Kindle after finishing the book and turned to news websites, the first headline I read was on this New York Times column: "Democrats, Don't Wish for Your Own Rogue." The subhead: "Bloomberg's record and misleading statements make him a dangerous choice."
Author Charles Blow has castigated Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, throughout the campaign and did so again.
"It is truly a devastating sight to watch liberals who have winced for years at Donald Trump's issues on wealth, race and women allow fear, propaganda and influence mercenaries to push them into supporting a man who has his own issues concerning wealth, women and race," he wrote. "It is jaw-dropping to see people who have long centered morality and conviction as their guiding light willfully say that they are willing to forgo all that."
Blow's column is one of many of this ilk; it just happened to be the first one I saw after the book.
Then I immediately thought of another New York Times headline, this one from last fall: "But her emails..."
It topped an editorial reacting to news that a three-year investigation found no criminal wrongdoing in Hillary Clinton's handling of her emails. Trump regularly lied about this late in the 2016 campaign, as in this quote: "Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure, knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk," he said to lock-her-up chants by supporters.
And mainstream reporters and pundits, for all of the chatter about liberal bias, played along and elevated her emails into a narrative that roughly equated with Trump's deep and awful record on women and business and so on. You know, to appear balanced.
Hey, so let's go do this whole false equivalency thing all over again.
That is precisely how Blow's and many other hyperventilating attack pieces strike me.
It's just that the future of the nation is in greater peril - facing the prospect of an even more authoritarian Trump in a second term - than at any time since at least the Civil War. If you think that's hyperbole, we'll agree to disagree.
Do I think Bloomberg is a perfect candidate? Of course not. His first debate performance was shaky. He came across as stiff and humorless and was mostly panned by pundits.
Bloomberg has clearly made mistakes, notable ones, but he has said he is willing to drop $1 billion of his personal fortune on Trump. Yes, it would be nice if we lived in a world before the Citizens United decision that has despoiled American politics with corporate money, but we don't.
All of the major candidates have flaws. None is Barack Obama.
Though Elizabeth Warren has slipped in the polls lately, she dominated the stage at Wednesday night's debate and might be best at welding together the party's warring moderate and progressive wings.
Then there is Bernie Sanders. A recent national Gallup poll said 90 percent of respondents could support a woman or someone who is Jewish, black, Hispanic or Catholic. Sixty percent said they'd support an atheist. Only forty-five percent said they would be willing to vote for a socialist. Sanders sees himself as a revolutionary. I see him as unelectable.
Anyway, my pivot from immersion in a book detailing the unprecedented daily horror of Trump as president to a column bloviating about the roughly equal awfulness of Bloomberg was too much for me not to comment upon.
Are we really going to do this again?

TRUMP'S BUDGET PLAN IS FULL OF ATROCITIES

Texto completo: Take a look at Donald Trump's budget plan for the country's next fiscal year and you'll know how lucky we are that Americans elected a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in 2018.
Thanks to that fact, Trump's budget proposal for the 2020-21 fiscal year shouldn't stand a chance of becoming law. And that's a good thing, because it would spell disaster for millions of Americans.
The bottom line is that Trump's proposal protects his rich man's tax cuts, spends yet more money on the military and, to help pay for it, cuts the safety net that has helped people avoid utter despair.
Some of the details include doing way with student loan help. As Trump proposed last year, it seeks to eliminate subsidized federal student loans and end the public service loan forgiveness program that has served as an incentive for teachers, police officers and government workers to free themselves of student debt after making payments for at least 10 years. The proposal died last year as it should again this year.
It makes major cuts to Medicaid by reducing funding for the health plan that covers the poor and the disabled, and proposes to do away with subsidies for the working poor who are on the Affordable Care Act. The cuts, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would cause some states to reverse their programs to expand Medicaid to those too poor to buy health insurance.
That, of course, would be right up Wisconsin's GOP legislators' alley. They, along with their former leader, Scott Walker, have refused to allow thousands of the state's poor to participate anyhow.
Then there's the plan to enact even deeper cuts in environmental initiatives. The EPA would experience a 26% cut in its funding, and 50 programs that have been developed to protect the air and water over the years would be eliminated.
Not surprisingly, the budget section covering the environment does not mention climate change. The New York Times pointed out that in Trump's budget document, the administration claims that air pollutant emissions dropped between 2016 and 2018, and insists the country has "some of the cleanest air and water in the world."
The president lies even in his budget proposals, for the reality is that air quality improved significantly in the decade before Trump came to power. Federal figures show that fine particulate pollution has increased the past two years.
Food assistance programs, including so-called food stamps, would be available to fewer people under Trump's plan. So would housing assistance, including programs that help pay for rental assistance for low-income people.
The Commerce Department would be cut by 37%, affecting programs that monitor the weather, promote exports and administer economic development efforts.
The national railroad system, Amtrak, would lose funds for its long-distance trains that serve hundreds of communities that have no other means of public transportation. Foreign aid would be cut by 8% and funds for the United Nations would be drastically reduced.
But, of course, the already bloated defense budget would see another increase, and the administration is working on plans to build new nuclear weapons in case we have to blow up the world someday.
Initiatives to crackdown on illegal immigration would get a big funding boost and, naturally, there's $2 billion more for the big, beautiful border wall with Mexico.
We're told not to fret, though. Most of Trump's budget atrocities will never make it through the House.
Isn't it amazing how he's making America great again?

Texto completo: The Pennsylvania Department of Education has released the average SAT scores at public schools across the state.
The averages come from students in the class of 2019 who took the standardized test - about 2.2 million students nationwide, according to College Board, the institution that administers the test.
The exam is often used as a tool for college admissions, and the tests are made up of three sections: a math section and reading section are both scored on scales of 200-800. An essay portion is scored is scored separately on a scale of 2-8.
Total scores range from 400-1600.
Across Pennsylvania, the average score for public schools was 1041. The report does not include private or religious schools.
The average composite score for public school in Allegheny County was 1046; in Westmoreland, it was 1079. The average for each school is dependent upon the number of students who took the test, meaning that schools with fewer students could see scores skewed one way or another.
Upper St. Clair topped the list in Western Pennsylvania and ranked ninth in the state with an average composite score of 1238.9. North Allegheny Senior High School ranked No. 10 at 1235.9.
Franklin Regional was the highest-ranked Westmoreland County school (47th) with an average composite score of 1166. Eleven schools from within the WPIAL ranked in the top 50.
SAT scores chart
The standardized tests have long come under criticism, including the recent "Varsity Blues" scandal that saw wealthy parents bribing test administrators, through a middle-man, to change test scores or let students cheat.
Most recently, the College Board in August backed off of a plan to add an "adversity score" to the test, according to the New York Times. The score was a number between 1 and 100 that critics said reduced an applicant's background - like school and neighborhood environments - to a single number.
The adversity score was set to be part of a larger data set provided to college admissions. Some of that data will still be available to colleges - and students - but it will not be a single number.
At the same time, more schools are foregoing the test requirements for admissions. PBS reported in October that one in four institutions no longer require SATs or ACTs for admissions.
The University of Chicago reported an increase in first-generation and lower-income students for the 2019-20 school year after making the tests optional for admissions, according to Inside Higher Ed. That, combined with a number of other initiatives at the school, increased the number of first-generation and law-income students by 20%.

Texto completo: No recibirá cadena perpetua, pero irá a prisión.
Este lunes, un tribunal de Nueva York declaró a Harvey Weinstein culpable de dos de los cinco cargos que enfrentaba tras ser acusado por varias mujeres de acoso, abuso sexual y violación.
El jurado -formado por siete hombres y cinco mujeres- condenó al otrora poderoso productor de Hollywood por violación en tercer grado y por cometer un acto sexual criminal en primer grado , pero lo exculpó de los dos cargos principales en su contra: agresión sexual depredadora y violación en primer grado.
Aunque las acusaciones mayores podrían haberlo llevado a una sentencia de cadena perpetua, los casos por los que fue encontrado culpable conllevan una pena de entre 5 y 25 años de prisión.

* La caída en desgracia de Harvey Weinstein, el poderoso productor de Hollywood acusado de acosar mujeres durante casi 30 años
Tras el anuncio de la sentencia, el juez ordenó que Weinstein , que se encontraba en libertad bajo fianza tras pagar US$1 millón en junio de 2018, volviera a la cárcel sin posibilidad de fianza.
Getty ImagesWeinstein acudió al juicio ayudado de un andador.
El exproductor, que todavía enfrenta cargos en Los Ángeles por violación y agresión sexual de dos mujeres en 2013, niega los cargos en su contra y asegura que se trataron de “relaciones consentidas”.
Más de 80 mujeres, incluidas actrices famosas, han acusado a Weinstein de conducta sexual inapropiada desde hace décadas.
Todo comenzó en octubre de 2017 cuando el periódico estadounidense The New York Times publicó un extenso reportaje en el que se detallaban acusaciones contra Weinstein que se remontaban a décadas atrás.
Las actrices Rose McGowan y Ashley Judd fueron dos de las mujeres que alzaron la voz contra el magnate desde el principio y muchas otras se unieron después.
El escándalo por las acusaciones contra Weinstein derivó en un movimiento global en el que miles de mujeres de todo el mundo denunciaron situaciones de abuso y acoso sexual bajo la etiqueta #MeToo (“Yo también”).

Texto completo: Más de tres años después de su llegada a la Casa Blanca, el presidente Donald Trump solamente ha construido unas 72 millas (177 km) de las 1,000 millas (1,609 kilómetros) del polémico muro que prometió erigir en la frontera con México, de acuerdo con cifras oficiales citadas por el diario The Washington Post.
No permita, sin embargo, que ese dato le lleve a sacar conclusiones erróneas.
Durante el actual gobierno ha habido una reducción significativa de la inmigración en Estados Unidos , aunque esta no ha sido conseguida gracias a la barrera fronteriza sino a lo que expertos y medios estadounidenses han bautizado como “el muro invisible de Trump”.
* Una nueva visa y una prueba de civismo: cuáles son los principales cambios que propone Trump para el sistema migratorio de EE.UU.
* Cómo el gobierno de Trump está limitando también la inmigración legal a Estados Unidos
¿A qué se refieren? Al incesante y cuidadoso cambio en las normas migratorias impulsado por el ejecutivo que ha hecho más cuesta arriba el camino que deben recorrer los extranjeros que desean establecerse siguiendo los cauces legales en Estados Unidos.
Así, esta nueva línea de defensa fronteriza afecta más a quienes aspiran a in migrar legalmente que a los llamados “sin papeles”.
Getty ImagesTrump no ha podido conseguir que el Congreso le apruebe los grandes montos requeridos para la construcción del muro.
Pero ¿cuánto realmente se ha reducido la inmigración legal?
De acuerdo con los expertos, una norma que significará una restricción importante a partir de ahora será la nueva regla final de “ Carga p ública “ , que entró en vigor este lunes y que prevé la posibilidad de negar la residencia permanente o una extensión de visado a aquellos extranjeros que las autoridades migratorias consideren que no son capaces de mantenerse por sí mismos y, por tanto, p ueden convertirse en una carga económica para el Estado .
Hasta la semana pasada, solamente aquellos inmigrantes que se encontraban muy próximos o por debajo de la línea oficial de pobreza o que habían requerido ayuda financiera sostenida durante largo plazo eran rechazados, lo que ocurría en menos del 1% de los casos.
A partir de ahora, los funcionarios de migración tomarán en cuenta no solo los ingresos sino también otro conjunto de elementos como la edad, la salud y la educación del solicitante.
Otro elemento fundamental es que la persona no haya usado beneficios sociales como subsidios a la vivienda o ayudas para la alimentación durante 12 de los últimos 36 meses.
Getty ImagesAunque legalmente les pueda corresponder, aceptar beneficios sociales como las ayudas para alimentos (food stamps) puede perjudicar a los inmigrantes que busquen la residencia permanente en Estados Unidos.
En agosto pasado, cuando la norma fue aprobada, el director en funciones del Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés), Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, defendió la nueva regla argumentando que servirá para garantizar que los inmigrantes que lleguen al país sean autosuficientes y no se conviertan en una carga para la sociedad.
* Por qué es tan caro ser pobre en Estados Unidos
“El presidente Trump sigue cumpliendo con su promesa con el pueblo estadounidense de aplicar las leyes migratorias de nuestra nación”, escribió Cuccinelli en un artículo aparecido en The Hill, a propósito de la entrada en vigor de la nueva regla sobre “Carga pública”.
El cambio, sin embargo, ha sido duramente cuestionado y muchos argumentan que no se trata de una simple reinterpretación de las normas existentes.
“Esta es una reescritura fundamental de nuestras leyes migratorias a través de las órdenes ejecutivas “, le dijo al diario The New York Times Kamal Essaheb, subdirector del Centro Nacional de Derecho de Inmigración (NILC, por sus siglas en inglés).
Por su parte, un análisis del Instituto de Políticas Migratorias (MPI, por sus siglas en inglés) estima que la nueva norma “tendrá un profundo efecto en el ingreso legal en EE.UU. y en el uso de beneficios públicos por parte de millones de extranjeros en situación legal y de los ciudadanos estadounidenses con quienes ellos viven”.
De acuerdo con cálculos de esa institución, la polémica regla puede llevar a que una parte significativa de los casi 23 millones de extranjeros y de estadounidenses que forman parte de familias inmigrantes decidan dejar de utilizar los beneficios públicos que les corresponden.

Texto completo: Más de tres años después de su llegada a la Casa Blanca, el presidente Donald Trump solamente ha construido unas 72 millas (177 km) de las 1,000 millas (1,609 kilómetros) del polémico muro que prometió erigir en la frontera con México, de acuerdo con cifras oficiales citadas por el diario The Washington Post.
No permita, sin embargo, que ese dato le lleve a sacar conclusiones erróneas.

Getty ImagesTrump no ha podido conseguir que el Congreso le apruebe los grandes montos requeridos para la construcción del muro.
Pero ¿cuánto realmente se ha reducido la inmigración legal?
De acuerdo con los expertos, una norma que significará una restricción importante a partir de ahora será la nueva regla final de “ Carga p ública “ , que entró en vigor este lunes y que prevé la posibilidad de negar la residencia permanente o una extensión de visado a aquellos extranjeros que las autoridades migratorias consideren que no son capaces de mantenerse por sí mismos y, por tanto, p ueden convertirse en una carga económica para el Estado .
Hasta la semana pasada, solamente aquellos inmigrantes que se encontraban muy próximos o por debajo de la línea oficial de pobreza o que habían requerido ayuda financiera sostenida durante largo plazo eran rechazados, lo que ocurría en menos del 1% de los casos.
A partir de ahora, los funcionarios de migración tomarán en cuenta no solo los ingresos sino también otro conjunto de elementos como la edad, la salud y la educación del solicitante.
Otro elemento fundamental es que la persona no haya usado beneficios sociales como subsidios a la vivienda o ayudas para la alimentación durante 12 de los últimos 36 meses.
Getty ImagesAunque legalmente les pueda corresponder, aceptar beneficios sociales como las ayudas para alimentos (food stamps) puede perjudicar a los inmigrantes que busquen la residencia permanente en Estados Unidos.
En agosto pasado, cuando la norma fue aprobada, el director en funciones del Servicio de Ciudadanía e Inmigración de Estados Unidos (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés), Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, defendió la nueva regla argumentando que servirá para garantizar que los inmigrantes que lleguen al país sean autosuficientes y no se conviertan en una carga para la sociedad.
* Por qué es tan caro ser pobre en Estados Unidos
“El presidente Trump sigue cumpliendo con su promesa con el pueblo estadounidense de aplicar las leyes migratorias de nuestra nación”, escribió Cuccinelli en un artículo aparecido en The Hill, a propósito de la entrada en vigor de la nueva regla sobre “Carga pública”.
El cambio, sin embargo, ha sido duramente cuestionado y muchos argumentan que no se trata de una simple reinterpretación de las normas existentes.
“Esta es una reescritura fundamental de nuestras leyes migratorias a través de las órdenes ejecutivas “, le dijo al diario The New York Times Kamal Essaheb, subdirector del Centro Nacional de Derecho de Inmigración (NILC, por sus siglas en inglés).
Por su parte, un análisis del Instituto de Políticas Migratorias (MPI, por sus siglas en inglés) estima que la nueva norma “tendrá un profundo efecto en el ingreso legal en EE.UU. y en el uso de beneficios públicos por parte de millones de extranjeros en situación legal y de los ciudadanos estadounidenses con quienes ellos viven”.
De acuerdo con cálculos de esa institución, la polémica regla puede llevar a que una parte significativa de los casi 23 millones de extranjeros y de estadounidenses que forman parte de familias inmigrantes decidan dejar de utilizar los beneficios públicos que les corresponden.

Texto completo: No recibirá cadena perpetua, pero irá a prisión.
Este lunes, un tribunal de Nueva York declaró a Harvey Weinstein culpable de dos de los cinco cargos que enfrentaba tras ser acusado por varias mujeres de acoso, abuso sexual y violación.
El jurado -formado por siete hombres y cinco mujeres- condenó al otrora poderoso productor de Hollywood por violación en tercer grado y por cometer un acto sexual criminal en primer grado , pero lo exculpó de los dos cargos principales en su contra: agresión sexual depredadora y violación en primer grado.
Aunque las acusaciones mayores podrían haberlo llevado a una sentencia de cadena perpetua, los casos por los que fue encontrado culpable conllevan una pena de entre 5 y 25 años de prisión.
* 5 claves del juicio por delitos sexuales al exproductor de Hollywood Harvey Weinstein
* La caída en desgracia de Harvey Weinstein, el poderoso productor de Hollywood acusado de acosar mujeres durante casi 30 años
Tras el anuncio de la sentencia, el juez ordenó que Weinstein , que se encontraba en libertad bajo fianza tras pagar US$1 millón en junio de 2018, volviera a la cárcel sin posibilidad de fianza.
Getty ImagesWeinstein acudió al juicio ayudado de un andador.
El exproductor, que todavía enfrenta cargos en Los Ángeles por violación y agresión sexual de dos mujeres en 2013, niega los cargos en su contra y asegura que se trataron de “relaciones consentidas”.
Más de 80 mujeres, incluidas actrices famosas, han acusado a Weinstein de conducta sexual inapropiada desde hace décadas.
Todo comenzó en octubre de 2017 cuando el periódico estadounidense The New York Times publicó un extenso reportaje en el que se detallaban acusaciones contra Weinstein que se remontaban a décadas atrás.
Las actrices Rose McGowan y Ashley Judd fueron dos de las mujeres que alzaron la voz contra el magnate desde el principio y muchas otras se unieron después.
El escándalo por las acusaciones contra Weinstein derivó en un movimiento global en el que miles de mujeres de todo el mundo denunciaron situaciones de abuso y acoso sexual bajo la etiqueta #MeToo (“Yo también”).

Texto completo: El 28 de septiembre del 2017, el gobernador de California Jerry Brown firmó la aprobación final de la Ley de Tiempo Primordial en las Elecciones Primarias (en inglés Prime Time Primary Act) propuesta por el senador estatal Ricardo Lara. De esta manera, ayudó a construir la que probablemente sea la mejor y más sólida estrategia política de los demócratas para ganar las elecciones presidenciales de noviembre.
El que California vote en un Súper Martes logrará consolidar al partido demócrata en torno a un fuerte candidato presidencial finalista. De tal manera, propiciará las condiciones políticas y electorales para hacerle frente a Donald Trump.
Ya en aquel momento con audacia sentenciaba Eric Bauman, presidente del partido demócrata de California, que: “era de sentido común asegurar que activistas de base, contribuyentes de campaña y votantes demócratas comunes del estado más grande y progresivo de la Unión, debían tener una participación mayor en la decisión de la nominación al candidato demócrata presidencial”.
California, agregó, “es el corazón palpitante de la resistencia a Trump y podría tener un papel crucial en seleccionar a un ganador progresista” en las elecciones presidenciales del 2020.
Hace más de un año, Shane Goldmacher y Jonathan Martin, conjeturaban acertadamente sobre las consecuencias políticas que tendría la estrategia de los demócratas —todos los impulsores de la ley, incluido el gobernador son demócratas— de adelantar y amalgamar las elecciones primarias de California con el famoso Súper Martes.
Estos reporteros del New York Times decían que California había sido por largo tiempo un estado secundario en las elecciones primarias. Sus elecciones se daban en junio, después de que el candidato presidencial demócrata ya estaba perfilado habiendo consolidado suficientes votos y delegados en casi todos los estados.
A partir de ahora, sin embargo, el papel de California, con sus 416 delegados a la Convención Demócrata, será decisivo en la contienda presidencial, ya que se definirán en una etapa temprana de las primarias partidistas.
Para ganar la nominación presidencial se requiere el apoyo de al menos 2,376 de los 4,750 delegados en la Convención que tendrá lugar en agosto.
Desde el otoño de 2017, los expertos calculaban que el verdadero impacto de las elecciones adelantadas de California dependería en gran medida de los resultados que se obtuvieran en las elecciones tempranas de Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada y Carolina del Sur.
“Si un sólo candidato domina esos cuatro estados, California… podría catapultar a ese candidato aún más a la delantera con una gran victoria de delegados”, escribieron Goldmacher y Martin.
“Por contraste, estrategas políticos dicen que, aquellos candidatos que sufran en esos primeros estados y pierdan tracción, tendrán gran dificultad en darle vuelta a las cosas en California, sin importar cuánto tiempo y dinero inviertan en el estado”.
Hoy por hoy, el candidato socialdemócrata Bernie Sanders se ha colocado a la delantera en New Hampshire y Nevada; consolidó un empate técnico en Iowa y se perfila hacia otro en Carolina del Sur.
En las elecciones primarias presidenciales de 2016, contra Hillary Clinton, Sanders recibió el 46.04% de los votos en California.
No hay actualmente un contrincante de la talla de Hillary que se le oponga a Sanders. Las encuestas le dan, las más conservadoras 7% y las menos hasta 15 o 21 puntos porcentuales de ventaja contra quien le sigue, el ex vicepresidente Joe Biden.
Sanders es el único candidato que ha mantenido su ascenso constante hasta alcanzar hoy un 43% de probabilidades de ganar las elecciones primarias del partido demócrata.
Con esta trayectoria, no me resulta difícil augurar que Sanders saldrá triunfador como el candidato presidencial de California y muchos de los 14 estados participantes del Súper Martes electoral del 3 de marzo. Y a pesar de que probablemente no va a ganar en Carolina del Sur, se consolidará como el candidato demócrata más fuerte.
Con base en los datos históricos de las primarias demócratas del 2016 y las ya celebradas este año, es imperativo vislumbrar qué consecuencias tiene que un candidato que se posiciona en los límites del campo de acción del partido demócrata emerja como el aspirante presidencial de un partido famélico, debilitado y alineado más hacia el espectro conservador de los republicanos que al centro o la izquierda de lo que fue el mejor momento del partido de la democracia.
Sanders es una gruesa e incómoda astilla para el orden político establecido del partido demócrata. En la segunda década del siglo XXI, los demócratas están más alineados con los intereses del neoliberalismo, la banca financiera especuladora del capital en Wall Street y los intereses de la élite minoritaria que condensa la riqueza en sus manos que con los valores más genuinos de un partido demócrata de centro.
Pero Sanders no se propone desmantelar toda la estructura inequitativa y explotadora del neoliberalismo. A pesar de que muchos lo califiquen como radical socialista, no lo es. Él mismo aseveró en el debate del martes 25 de febrero transmitido por la cadena CBS que no es un político de ideas radicales. No tiene la intención de cambiar el sistema capitalista.
Sanders sólo quiere, con una agenda populista y asistencialista, aliviar un poco las brechas de la desigualdad y la pobreza atendiendo algunos cambios puntuales que beneficiarán la calidad de vida de millones de estadounidenses. Los cambios más cruciales se refieren a un seguro de salud universal, aumento de impuestos para los multimillonarios, redistribución mínima de la riqueza elevando el salario mínimo, aliviar el endeudamiento por costos de la educación superior, y mejor calidad de vida en general para los pobres y la clase media.
Es el candidato que más esperanza da a la mayoría de los latinos, los afroamericanos, las mujeres, las minorías y las clases más desaventajadas. A los pobres y los clasemedieros que han visto sus vidas degradadas enormemente ante el embate del neoliberalismo. A quienes sufren el acrecentamiento de la desigualdad económica, cultural y social bajo el mandato del actual presidente racista, clasista y depredador que tenemos, Donald Trump.
Sanders es la mejor alternativa que tenemos no sólo para enfrentar a Trump, sino para recuperar un cierto sentido de dignidad y humanidad, de que nuestro país recupere una mínima calidad moral y una ruta hacia la estabilización de un ambiente nacional más humano y comprometido con el momento histórico, político y ambiental que estamos viviendo. Sanders ayudará a recobrar la conciencia de ser un país rico, consumidor de grandes recursos y de la debacle ecológica y moral de la que somos responsables.
Es responsabilidad de todos los demócratas del orden político establecido en el partido y fuera del partido. Es responsabilidad de los demócratas, independientes y progresistas de a pie, en las calles, en las escuelas, en los trabajos, en las guarderías, en los hospitales, en cada hogar, unirse y apoyar a Sanders para derrotar a Donald Trump en las elecciones de noviembre del 2020. Las diferencias estratégicas sobre cómo conducir al país a nivel interno o internacional pueden ser resueltas a través del diálogo y la negociación con Sanders. Ya es sabido que con Trump, no hay diálogo posible ni cambio hacia el bienestar común.
California es clave en determinar no sólo al candidato presidencial, sino también la agenda política y las estrategias para gobernar el país entero. Salir a votar el 3 de marzo, en este estado y todo el país no es sólo un acto político. Es un acto humano que afectará a los estadounidenses y a miles de millones de personas cuyas vidas están cifradas en el destino de nuestro país.
Derrotar a Donald Trump es nuestra prioridad humana, política y ecológica . Debemos unirnos bajo ese imperativo todos los que nos consideramos progresistas. No importa cuán cerca o lejos estemos de la rayita del bien común. Unifiquemos fuerzas: Bernie Sanders es la esperanza más sólida para derrotar a Donald Trump.

Texto completo: No recibirá cadena perpetua, pero irá a prisión.
Este lunes, un tribunal de Nueva York declaró a Harvey Weinstein culpable de dos de los cinco cargos que enfrentaba tras ser acusado por varias mujeres de acoso, abuso sexual y violación.
El jurado -formado por siete hombres y cinco mujeres- condenó al otrora poderoso productor de Hollywood por violación en tercer grado y por cometer un acto sexual criminal en primer grado , pero lo exculpó de los dos cargos principales en su contra: agresión sexual depredadora y violación en primer grado.
Aunque las acusaciones mayores podrían haberlo llevado a una sentencia de cadena perpetua, los casos por los que fue encontrado culpable conllevan una pena de entre 5 y 25 años de prisión.

* La caída en desgracia de Harvey Weinstein, el poderoso productor de Hollywood acusado de acosar mujeres durante casi 30 años
Tras el anuncio de la sentencia, el juez ordenó que Weinstein , que se encontraba en libertad bajo fianza tras pagar US$1 millón en junio de 2018, volviera a la cárcel sin posibilidad de fianza.
Getty ImagesWeinstein acudió al juicio ayudado de un andador.
El exproductor, que todavía enfrenta cargos en Los Ángeles por violación y agresión sexual de dos mujeres en 2013, niega los cargos en su contra y asegura que se trataron de “relaciones consentidas”.
Más de 80 mujeres, incluidas actrices famosas, han acusado a Weinstein de conducta sexual inapropiada desde hace décadas.
Todo comenzó en octubre de 2017 cuando el periódico estadounidense The New York Times publicó un extenso reportaje en el que se detallaban acusaciones contra Weinstein que se remontaban a décadas atrás.
Las actrices Rose McGowan y Ashley Judd fueron dos de las mujeres que alzaron la voz contra el magnate desde el principio y muchas otras se unieron después.
El escándalo por las acusaciones contra Weinstein derivó en un movimiento global en el que miles de mujeres de todo el mundo denunciaron situaciones de abuso y acoso sexual bajo la etiqueta #MeToo (“Yo también”).

Leonhardt: Sanders ignores moderates at his own risk

Texto completo: The last four presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump — are four very different politicians. But they have one crucial similarity: They all tried to appeal to voters who weren’t obvious supporters.
Clinton promised a “third way,” distinct from traditional Democratic or Republican policies. Bush ran on compassionate conservatism. Obama said that red and blue America shared more in common than pundits claimed.
Even Trump, radical as he is, flouted Republican orthodoxy by sounding like a populist Democrat on Social Security, Medicare and trade. Polls showed that voters judged Trump to be more moderate than any Republican nominee since the 1970s.
The art of peeling off voters — those in the middle or those who aren’t ideological — may be the most important skill in politics. It doesn’t require a mushy centrist policy agenda, either. Trump has made that clear. So, in earlier eras, did Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
How? By understanding that politics is inescapably performative. Voters respond to signals. They respond to gestures of respect from politicians who are willing to say, in effect: We may not agree on everything, but I see you and understand what matters to you.
The newly energetic American left has largely rejected this approach, choosing instead to believe a comforting myth about swing voters being extinct and turnout being a cure-all. It’s a big mistake.
Before going further, I want to make clear that this is not a column urging Democrats to return to Clintonian centrism. I’m making a different case — that the left is hurting is own ability to win elections and enact sweeping change by insisting on an orthodox version of progressivism.
To put it another way: Can you think of one way that Bernie Sanders is signaling respect to voters outside of his base?
He has taken a nearly maximalist liberal position on every major issue. It’s especially striking from him, because he has shown over his career that he grasps the importance of building a coalition.
Sanders once won over blue-collar Vermonters with help from a moderate position on guns. “We need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country,” he said in 2015, “and I think I can play an important role in this.” He was also once an heir to organized labor’s skepticism of large-scale immigration. “At a time when the middle class is shrinking, the last thing we need is to bring over in a period of years, millions of people into this country who are prepared to lower wages for American workers,” he said in 2007.
Now, though, Sanders has evidently decided that progressives will no longer accept impurities — or even much tactical vagueness. He, along with Elizabeth Warren, has embraced policies that are popular on the left and nowhere else: a ban on fracking; the decriminalization of border crossings; the provision of federal health benefits to unauthorized immigrants; the elimination of private health insurance.
For many progressives, each of these issues has become a moral litmus test. Any restriction of immigration is considered a denial of human rights. Any compromise on guns or health care is an acceptance of preventable deaths.
And I understand the progressive arguments on these issues. But turning every compromise into an existential moral failing is not a smart way to practice politics. It comforts the persuaded while alienating the persuadable.
FDR and Reagan understood this, as did Abraham Lincoln and many great social reformers, including Frederick Douglass, Jane Addams, Martin Luther King Jr. and Cesar Chavez. Strong political movements can accept impurity on individual issues in the service of a larger goal: winning.
The impurities will still produce bitter complaints, of course. FDR and Reagan were both lambasted by their allies at times. But few of those allies abandoned them. Victory is an excellent balm.
Over the past few years, the progressive left has made impressive progress, elevating issues like the $15 minimum wage, expanded Medicare and free college. A central figure in the movement, Sanders, is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination.
But progressives are still a very long way from achieving the changes they seek. Republicans control the Senate, and a conservative majority runs the Supreme Court. Trump has an excellent chance to win reelection and usher in a dark era for American progressivism.
Faced with the potential of either large gains or historic losses, progressives would be wise to stop believing only what they want to believe. Don’t cherry-pick polls to claim that most Americans actually favor a ban on private insurance. Don’t imagine that millions of heretofore silent progressive supporters will materialize on Election Day. In the 2018 midterms, Sanders-style candidates lost swing districts, while candidates demonstrating respect to swing voters won again and again.
Beating Trump in November will be even harder. And uncomfortable compromises will make it more likely.
For Sanders, that may mean walking back his position on fracking, which threatens his chances in must-win Pennsylvania. It could also mean repeating some of his earlier arguments about the need for border security and immigration restrictions. Many working-class voters, including people of color, agree with that.
Sanders is not an ideal Democratic nominee. But he does have some big strengths. One of them is the passionate support he inspires, which gives him an opportunity to reach out to new voters while holding on to his base.

Trump Campaign Sues New York Times Over Opinion Piece; A Times spokeswoman says 'the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—President Trump's campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing it of knowingly publishing false and defamatory statements in an opinion piece on the 2016 election and Russia.
The piece, headlined "The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo," was published in March 2019 and was written by Max Frankel, who was executive editor of the Times from 1986 to 1994.
Mr. Frankel wrote, "There was no need for detailed electoral collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin's oligarchy because they had an overarching deal: the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration's burdensome economic sanctions. The Trumpites knew about the quid and held out the prospect of the quo."
The lawsuit, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages and was filed Wednesday with the New York State Supreme Court, states the piece doesn't cite proof for claims of a quid pro quo or a deal between the campaign and Russia.
"The Trump campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable," a spokeswoman for the newspaper said in a statement. "Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance."
The suit states the "falsity of the story" was confirmed by special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Mr. Mueller's report detailed a series of contacts between Russians and Trump campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., but didn't establish a conspiracy between the campaign and the Russian government to interfere in the election.
While the Times published Mr. Frankel's piece before the Mueller report was made public, the lawsuit contends that the Times had already reported details about the meetings that, the suit said, indicated there was no deal or quid pro quo.
Mr. Trump Jr. testified before Congress in September 2017 that he agreed to meet a Russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump's 2016 rival, because he believed the meeting could shed light on the "fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate."
Among the examples the suit cites is a statement from the president's son saying the meeting "provided no meaningful information."
He also said, "I did not collude with any foreign government and do not know of anyone who did."
The suit was filed on behalf of the campaign by lawyer Charles Harder, who in the same capacity in October 2019 sent a letter to CNN threatening to sue the network over its coverage. CNN dismissed it as a "PR stunt." Mr. Harder had previously taken successful action on behalf of Hulk Hogan against Gawker.com, which ultimately led to the site folding.

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) - Clive Cussler, the million-selling adventure writer and real-life thrill-seeker who wove personal details and spectacular fantasies into his page-turning novels about underwater explorer Dirk Pitt, has died, his publisher said Wednesday.
Cussler died Monday at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, said Alexis Welby, spokeswoman for publisher Penguin Random House. He was 88. The cause was not disclosed.
Cussler dispatched Pitt and pal Al Giordino on exotic missions highlighted by shipwrecks, treachery, espionage and beautiful women, in popular works including "Cyclops,'' “Night Probe!” and his commercial breakthrough, "Raise the Titanic!"
Cussler was an Illinois native who was raised in Southern California and lived in Arizona for most of his final years, but he sent Pitt around the globe in plots that ranged from the bold to the incredible. "The Treasure" features an aspiring Aztec despot who murders an American envoy, the hijacking of a plane carrying the United Nations secretary-general and soldiers from ancient Rome looting the Library of Alexandria. In "Iceberg," the presidents of French Guiana and the Dominican Republic are the ones in danger, during a visit to Disneyland. In "Sahara," a race across the desert somehow leads to new information about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
"Again and again, Dirk Pitt, working for the fictional National Underwater and Marine Agency, must find a sunken vessel and retrieve some artifact," Mark Schone, summarizing Cussler's novels, wrote in The New York Times in 2004. “Evil forces, be they Commies or Blofeldian madmen, try to stop him. Along the way Pitt saves himself, the world and the damsel of the moment."
Cussler has a new novel, “Journey of the Pharaohs," set to be released March 10, with several more awaiting posthumous publication.
In real life, Cussler founded his own National Underwater and Marine Agency and participated in dozens of searches for old ships, including one that turned up a steamship belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt. He also had a long history of questionable claims - some admitted, some denied.
"He can definitely spin the tall tales and is a master of fiction. But that doesn't mean I buy into his alleged discovery claims," Dr. E. Lee Spence wrote on his blog in 2011. Spence, a prominent underwater archaeologist feuded with Cussler over which of them recovered a Confederate submarine.
Born an only child in 1931 in Aurora, Illinois, and raised in Alhambra, California, Cussler's name and writing persona have the air of a pseudonym, but he was born with his moniker, named for the British actor Clive Brook. He studied for two years at Pasadena City College before enlisting in the Air Force and serving as a mechanic and flight engineer during the Korean War.
In 1955, he married Barbara Knight, with whom he had three children. Through much of the 1960s, he worked in advertising, as a copywriter and creative director. Among the better known slogans he helped coin - "It's stronger than dirt," for an Ajax laundry detergent campaign.
In his free time, he was writing fiction and moonlighting at a skin-diving equipment shop, where his wife suggested he work to help gather material for his novels.
“When creating advertising, I had always looked at the competition and wondered what I could conceive that was totally different,” Cussler said in an interview included in "Dirk Pitt Revealed," a nonfiction book released in 1998. "(James) Bond was becoming incredibly popular through the movies, and I knew I couldn't match Ian Fleming's style and prose. So I was determined not to write about a detective, secret agent or undercover investigator or deal in murder mysteries. My hero's adventures would be based on and under water."
Cussler finished manuscripts for "Mediterranean Caper" and "Iceberg," but had no literary agent: so he created one. He purchased a thousand sheets of blank letter paper, got a friend in advertising to design a logo for "The Charles Winthrop Agency" and sent his first inquiry to Peter Lampack of the William Morris Agency. Lampack agreed to take on Cussler and remained with him long after the author confessed his charade.
"I told him the story of Charlie Winthrop with great trepidation," Cussler explained to the Arizona Republic. "I sat there waiting for the result, and he sat there blank for a minute, and then he laughed himself under the table. And he said, 'Oh my God. I always thought Charlie Winthrop was some guy I met while I was drunk at a cocktail party.'"
"Mediterranean Caper" came out in 1973, followed by "Iceberg" two years later and "Raise the Titanic!" in 1976. He would turn out more than 20 Dirk Pitt novels and expand into children's books and such adventure series as "The Oregon Files" and "The Numa Files."
Cussler had claimed his worldwide sales topped 100 million copies, but in a legal battle with Crusader Entertainment, which alleged he had misrepresented his popularity, it was determined the number was closer to 40 million. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded Crusader $5 million but also ordered that Cussler receive $8.5 million because the film company only adapted one ("Sahara") of the two books it had agreed to produce.
The film version of "Sahara" came out in 2005 and starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz. An adaptation of “Raise the Titanic!” - its title the same except for dropping the exclamation point, came out in 1980 and featured Jason Robards and Alec Guinness.
In recent years, Cussler began working with co-authors and collaborated with his son on "Poseidon's Arrow," "Crescent Dawn" and "Arctic Drift." Cussler's son is Dirk Cussler. Pitt himself had a son, called, of course, Dirk Pitt Jr.
In addition to Dirk Cussler, the author is survived by his second wife, Janet, daughters Teri and Dayna, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Texto completo: Facial recognition software firm Clearview AI, which has been criticized for scraping together a database of as many as 3 billion online images, has been hit with a data breach.
The firm, based in New York, apparently saw its list of customers, which includes numerous law enforcement agencies, stolen, according to The Daily Beast, which first reported the incident.
The news site reported that it had obtained a notice sent to Clearview's customers that an intruder had “gained unauthorized access” to its customer list, the number of searches customers have conducted and other data.
Clearview said in the notice that the company’s servers were not breached and that there was “no compromise of Clearview’s systems or network. ”
Email still beats texting: Especially for hackers phishing for your data
Video game legacy: Kazuhisa Hashimoto, creator of the 'Konami Code' for video games, has died
However, Clearview's attorney, Tor Ekeland, said in a statement sent to USA TODAY, "Security is Clearview's top priority. Unfortunately, data breaches are part of life in the 21st century. Our servers were never accessed. We patched the flaw, and continue to work to strengthen our security. "
Facial recognition spurs privacy concerns
The issue of facial recognition technology and privacy has been controversial lately. Student uproar over the potential implementation of the face-scanning technology at the University of California Los Angeles led the school to drop the plan. An editorial in The Daily Bruin student newspaper described the plan as "a major breach of students’ privacy" that makes "students feel unsafe on a campus they are supposed to call home. "
Clearview attracted attention after The New York Times reported in January that the startup had built a database of more than 3 billion images gathered from social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, as well as payment site Venmo and other online destinations.
The company notes on its website that it searches the open web – not private social media accounts – and markets its investigative tool only to law enforcement agencies and "is NOT available to the public. " Federal and state law enforcement officials told The Times that they had used Clearview's app in solving cases from shoplifting to murder and child sexual exploitation cases.
Clearview was founded by Australian technologist Hoan Ton-That and Richard Schwartz, an aide to then-New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the Times reported, and counts Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel among its investors.
Clearview faces criticism
Since the report's publication, Google, Facebook, Twitter and Venmo have sent cease-and-desist letters to Clearview demanding the company stop using its platforms for gathering imagery.
“YouTube’s Terms of Service explicitly forbid collecting data that can be used to identify a person,” YouTube spokesman Alex Joseph said in a statement. “Clearview has publicly admitted to doing exactly that, and in response we sent them a cease and desist letter. ”
The New Jersey attorney general has banned police from using Clearview's app, The Times reported, and the company also faces class action lawsuits in Illinois and Virginia.
And Clearview is coming under scrutiny by some in the U. S. Congress. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N. C. , has called for House Financial Services Committee chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif. , to schedule a hearing on the company's data collection practices, Axios reported.
Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass. , who last month expressed concerns about Clearview's technology, strengthened his unease after Wednesday's report: "Clearview’s statement that security is its ‘top priority’ would be laughable if the company’s failure to safeguard its information wasn’t so disturbing and threatening to the public’s privacy,” he said in a statement.
While the company said it had not been hacked, the incident raises concerns, he says.
“If your password gets breached, you can change your password. If your credit card number gets breached, you can cancel your card. But you can’t change biometric information like your facial characteristics if a company like Clearview fails to keep that data secure," Markey said. "This is a company whose entire business model relies on collecting incredibly sensitive and personal information, and this breach is yet another sign that the potential benefits of Clearview’s technology do not outweigh the grave privacy risks it poses. ”

Trump campaign sues New York Times in libel lawsuit involving opinion piece on Russia

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's re-election campaign has filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times for publishing an opinion piece on the topic of Russian involvement in the 2016 election.
The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday, claims the newspaper intentionally published a false story in 2019 related to the investigation into Russia interference of the election.
A New York Times spokesperson told USA TODAY that, "The Trump Campaign has turned to the courts to try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable. "
"Fortunately, the law protects the right of Americans to express their judgments and conclusions, especially about events of public importance. We look forward to vindicating that right in this case," the statement continued.
The Trump campaign is seeking millions of dollars in damage, taking issue with an op-ed from last March written by Max Frankel, the former executive editor of the newspaper: "The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo. "
The op-ed argues that there was an agreement between Russia and Trump's campaign to assist him in getting elected. The opinions section of The Times operates separately from its newsgathering operation and exists specifically to allow people a platform for expressing their point of view.
“There was no need for detailed electoral collusion between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin’s oligarchy because they had an overarching deal," the op-ed reads. "[T]he quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration’s burdensome economic sanctions. The Trumpites knew about the quid and held out the prospect of the quo. "
A statement from the campaign states they wish "to hold the news organization accountable for intentionally publishing false statements" against Trump's campaign.
Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign, said, "The statements were and are 100 percent false and defamatory. The complaint alleges The Times was aware of the falsity at the time it published them, but did so for the intentional purpose of hurting the campaign, while misleading its own readers in the process. ”
The op-ed was published on March 27, 2019, before the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full 448-page report to the public in April. The op-ed was written three days after Attorney General William Barr sent a letter of his summary of Mueller's investigation to Congress.
Mueller spent two years investigating Russian interference in the presidential election and whether Trump obstructed the inquiry that consumed Washington.
The report details that Trump's campaign showed interest in benefiting from Russian government efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election in his favor, but investigators did not find evidence that directly linked Trump to any crimes.
The lawsuit claims that the newspaper's own previous reporting "confirmed the falsity of these statements. "
"But The Times published these statements anyway, knowing them to be false, and knowing it would misinform and mislead its own readers, because of The Times’ extreme bias against and animosity toward the Campaign," the lawsuit says.
Trump has maintained his attacks on the media through the duration of his presidency, denouncing coverage he dislikes as "fake news. " He has threatened to sue other media companies before.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT. , who is running for the Democratic nomination to compete against Trump in November, blasted the campaign for the lawsuit, saying Trump, "now – taking a page from his dictator friends around the world – is trying to dismantle the right to a free press. "
Since the 1964 New York Times Co. V. Sullivan decision, the government found that to sustain a claim of libel: "Factual error, content defamatory of official reputation, or both, are insufficient to warrant an award of damages for false statements unless 'actual malice' -- knowledge that statements are false or in reckless disregard of the truth -- is alleged and proved. "
Brian Hauss, staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project called the lawsuit "completely meritless. "
"A publisher cannot be held liable for commentary based on public facts. If the law were any different, President Trump himself could be held liable for asserting that the Democrats colluded with Russia," he continued.

Can Sanders be stopped?

Texto completo: With Bernie Sanders romping in Nevada, we come to it again. The insurgent candidate, armored against normal political forces and equipped with a passionate following, leads a field of more conventional party politicians. His early-state successes have given him a clear path to a plurality of pledged convention delegates. And his rivals are dividing the votes that might derail him while what remains of the party establishment day by day proves itself irrelevant.
As with Donald Trump in 2016, so with Sanders so far in 2020. The characters are different, but the same dynamics are in play.
The Democratic Party, no less than the Republican Party, looks like a derelict ship awaiting capture by a band of pirates. The center-left establishment, no less than its GOP counterpart, seems old, exhausted, promising to mildly reform a status quo that an intense and motivated portion of its base regards as too decadent to be worth preserving. And the party actors who don't want to see Sanders nominated are finding, like NeverTrumpers before them, that it's awfully hard to stop a candidate if you can't agree on the alternative.
The repetition is far enough advanced that a replay of 2016 may be inevitable. But there's still time for conservatives who opposed Trump to offer some advice to Democrats who want to nominate someone other than the Vermont socialist.
So here are three lessons for PleaseNotBernie from the wreckage that was NeverTrump:
You need candidates who aren't actually winning primaries to drop out.
The fatal conceit of establishment politicians facing an insurgency is that because the insurgent has obvious weaknesses, they should hang around and hang around, piling up third-place finishes and minor delegate hauls, in the hopes of gaining ... something. What they are actually likely to gain is blame, irrelevance or both; just ask those noted influencers Jeb Bush and John Kasich.
So if you are, say, Amy Klobuchar, the fact that you have a solid case for your own electability is not a reason to stick around for Super Tuesday if you finish behind Pete Buttigieg in South Carolina as well as in Nevada. If you're Buttigieg, your strong Iowan and New Hampshire performances aren't a reason to stay in if it's clear you can't compete nationally with Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden. If you're Biden, if you lose South Carolina you should drop out the next day. And so on.
None of this means that simply consolidating the field will stop Bernie; he might well win a head-to-head race, too. But giving him five or six opponents in every contest makes the solidity of his core support an insurmountable advantage. And if you can narrow the field, the second lesson comes into play.
Against an unconventional front-runner, unconventional measures are required.
In the case of Trump, the person most willing to think this way was Ted Cruz, who made a serious bid to induce Marco Rubio to join him in an anti-Trump unity ticket. Would this have ultimately worked? Quite possibly not, but it was a brighter idea than the path that Rubio ultimately took - passionately bemoaning Trump's ascent but refusing to gamble boldly in response.
There isn't an obvious unity ticket equivalent for the non-Sanders Democrats, but the dynamic between Bloomberg, Biden and Buttigieg is worth watching. They are all positioned as moderate alternatives to the Sanders revolution, and after South Carolina and Super Tuesday one of them may look a lot more viable than the others. In which case two of the B's swiftly dropping out and just as swiftly campaigning and fundraising for (or simply funding, in Bloomberg's case) the third might be the only chance at a not-Sanders consolidation. And that chance is worth taking because of the third lesson.
You probably can't stop a plurality candidate at a contested convention.
And that's especially true if he has a clear delegate lead. I spent the early months of 2016 arguing otherwise, but the party system I was defending is pretty obviously dead. There's little stomach among party officialdom to work against a candidate who wins the most primary votes, and voters themselves are unlikely to sustain rival candidacies if they're clearly just playing for a brokered convention.
I suspect that this is what doomed Cruz, in the end: Between his victory in Wisconsin and his campaign-ending defeat in Indiana, part of the anti-Trump coalition seemed to become exhausted by the idea of a convention fight that at best would end with Trump trying to split the party and voted strategically to end the race early instead.
The Democrats' delegate apportionment rules do make a contested convention more likely, but Bernie is better-liked by most Democrats than Trump was by Republicans at this stage in '16. So my bet is that history will repeat itself: A world where Sanders is on track to get a clear delegate plurality in late March is probably a world where he gets a majority by May.
Which means that the long game of delegate accumulation and superdelegate machination is probably irrelevant, and the only question is whether it's possible to unite a not-Sanders vote across the first three Tuesdays in March.
To quote an ancient NeverTrump proverb: Good luck with that.

Ronny Jackson, ex-White House doctor, says he put cauliflower in Trump's mashed potatoes to improve his diet

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A former White House doctor says that while he regrets being unable to get President Donald Trump to exercise more, he did manage to slightly improve the president's diet.
"The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to," retired Navy Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson told The New York Times.
"But we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible, we were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes. "
Jackson did not say whether the president, now 73, was aware the vegetable had been added to his starchy side, the Times reported.

Jackson joined the White House medical team in 2006 and became its director in 2011. In 2013, he became President Barack Obama's physician and kept that role under Trump.
After Trump's first physical in office, Jackson declared Trump "fit for duty" in a news conference. In a summary of his exam, he said the 6-foot-3-inch, 239-pound president's "overall health is excellent. "
White House doctor: President Trump 'is in excellent health' and physical 'went exceptionally well'
Amid public questions about Trump's mental health, Jackson told reporters that tests revealed "no cognitive or mental issues whatsoever. " But he said he told Trump he should try to lose 10-15 pounds.
"We talked about diet and exercise a lot," Jackson said at the time. "He's more enthusiastic about the diet part than the exercise part, but we're going to do both. "
Jackson's inability to get the president to boost his exercise routine is not surprising given Trump's past opposition to fitness routines. Trump reportedly believes the human body has a finite amount of energy that can be used up by exercise and in 2015 he told The New York Times Magazine that his friends "who work out all the time" are "a disaster" and have to have frequent joint replacement surgeries.
As the oldest first-term president, Trump's lack of exercise and affinity for fast food raised concerns about his health during the 2016 campaign.
But Harold Bornstein, Trump's personal doctor prior to Jackson, declared in a December 2015 letter that if Trump won he would be "the healthiest person ever elected to the presidency. " Bornstein later admitted that the hyperbolic language was not written by him but by Trump.
In March 2018, Trump announced he was appointing Jackson to take over the Department of Veterans Affairs, but Jackson withdrew his name from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had doled out opioids without prescriptions and drank alcohol while on duty. Jackson said the allegations were "completely false. " An investigation into Jackson was opened by the Pentagon inspector general in June 2018 and remains ongoing.
Jackson is now running in a crowded primary field for Texas' 13th District, a congressional seat that opened up after 13-term Republican Rep. Mac Thornberry announced he would not seek reelection.

Texto completo: LONDON -- A lawyer for Julian Assange complained Tuesday that the WikiLeaks founder was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice and had court papers taken away on the first day of a hearing on his extradition to the United States.

Attorney Edward Fitzgerald told a judge that the treatment of Assange at London's Belmarsh Prison "could be a contempt of this court." The extradition hearing opened on Monday at Woolwich Crown Court, which is located next to the prison.

District Judge Vanessa Baraitser, who is hearing the case, said she had no power to act unless Assange became unable to participate in the proceedings, which are expected to last several months.

"If it comes to that, please let me know," the judge said.

Another lawyer for Assange, Gareth Peirce, told the judge on Tuesday that Assange was "struggling" and finding it hard to concentrate.

Assange, 48, is wanted in the U.S. on espionage charges over the leaking of classified government documents a decade ago.

U.S. prosecutors accuse Assange of conspiring with U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password, hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

They allege that WikiLeaks' publication of the unedited documents put U.S. intelligence sources who were mentioned in them at risk of torture of death.

Assange says he was acting as a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection. His lawyers argue that the U.S. charges -- which carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison -- are a politically motivated abuse of power.

Defense lawyers also deny that Assange put lives at risk. Attorney Mark Summers said that in 2010 WikiLeaks worked with international news organizations to publish the trove of files in edited form.

He said that the following year Assange phoned the White House to warn that a password published in a book about WikiLeaks by journalists from The Guardian newspaper -- one of WikiLeaks' then-media partners -- could allow people to view the full unredacted cache of documents. Summers said Assange had warned that "unless we do something, then people's lives are put at risk."

WikiLeaks' relationship with its media partners, which included The Guardian and The New York Times, soon soured, and in 2011 WikiLeaks began releasing large numbers of the uncensored documents.

The Guardian said it was "entirely wrong to say the Guardian's 2011 WikiLeaks book led to the publication of unredacted U.S. government files."

"The book contained a password which the authors had been told by Julian Assange was temporary and would expire and be deleted in a matter of hours," the newspaper said in a statement. "The book also contained no details about the whereabouts of the files."

Assange has been jailed in England since April 2019, when he was evicted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. He took refuge in the embassy seven years earlier to avoid being sent to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual assault.

A British court handed him a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in 2012.

The extradition hearing is expected to continue for the rest of the week, then take a break before resuming in May.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the past decade, technology startups grew so quickly that they couldn't hire people fast enough.
Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs.
Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.
"It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.
It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.
Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods.
Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.
Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.
Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which track startups.
And those are not the only signs of change.
Casper Sleep, which billed itself as the "Nike of sleep" by selling mattresses online, flopped when it went public this month. Once-hot companies like Lime, the electric scooter provider, have pulled out of some cities. Others, like e-commerce startup Brandless, game app HQ Trivia and electronics maker Essential Products, are on the verge of shutting down.
There are now "frantic mini-moments of panic, as one thing after another happens," said Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg's venture arm in San Francisco. "At some point, one rock after another will fall away from the cliff, and we'll realize we're not standing on anything in many, many companies."
Many startups are sagging after a difficult 2019, when prominent "unicorns" - companies valued at $1 billion or more by private investors - fell flat on Wall Street.
Uber and Lyft, which are losing billions of dollars a year, staged disappointing initial public offerings last spring. And WeWork, the office rental firm, pulled its public offering, ousted its chief executive and cut its valuation by 80% late last year.
The retreats are being led by companies that were backed by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate with a $100 billion Vision Fund for investing in startups. SoftBank bet big on companies like Uber and WeWork, as well as Colombian delivery startup Rappi and Indian hospitality startup Oyo.
All have undergone layoffs in recent months.
The pullback will probably not be as severe as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, when dozens of unprofitable internet firms failed.

Anchovies in starring role

Texto completo: Most anchovy pastas are minimalist things, born out of desperation with ingredients from the pantry. The assumption is that if you had anything else in the house, you'd surely cook that instead.
But true anchovy lovers beg to differ. For us, when anchovies are the starting point of a dish, they're also the star, making pasta so compelling that you won't want to relegate them to those nights when there's nothing in the fridge. You'll want to make them all the time.
I certainly do, loading anchovies into my pasta pot at least two or three times a month. (Actually, rare is the pasta that doesn't contain them.) I cook myriad variations, but the basic formula goes like this: Melt some anchovies and garlic into a pan of oil, then use that as the foundation for whatever sauce I want to build on.
In summer, there might be ripe tomatoes and herbs, or eggplant and peppers. In the fall, maybe mushrooms, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts. In winter, I like to use sturdy greens like broccoli raab, kale or spinach, which add vibrancy to the anchovies' umami funk.
In that last version, I also mix in some chopped cherry tomatoes for a little sweetness and color. Although I cook the anchovies and garlic in olive oil at the beginning of the dish, I stir in some butter at the end, which mellows the inherent bitterness of broccoli raab and rounds out the sauce.
A fat dollop of ricotta gives the pasta some creaminess, which I always crave when the weather gets cold, but it's not at all essential. And, while I love the saline tang of the capers, you can skip them if they are just one ingredient too many. With all those anchovies in the pan, you probably won't even miss them.
About those anchovies, for a dish like this, you need to get the good ones. I think the reason so many people are anti-anchovy is that there are a lot of bad, fishy ones on the market. Look for those packed in olive oil, and sample different brands until you find one you like. Then, stock up. After all, a pantry filled with anchovies is the beginning of many amazing future meals -- no matter what other ingredients you have in the house.

Pasta with garlicky anchovies and broccoli raab
Makes: 4 servings
Total time: 30 minutes

Kosher salt
12 ounces short pasta, such as shells, wagon wheels or rigatoni
2 packed cups parsley, leaves and tender stems
10 anchovy fillets, preferably packed in olive oil (one 2-ounce tin)
1 small bunch scallions, white and green parts, chopped
2 tablespoons capers, drained (optional)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced to a paste
1 (1-pound) bunch broccoli raab, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (plum, cherry or grape work well)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Pinch of red-pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
Ricotta, for serving (optional)

1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions until 1 minute shy of al dente. Use a coffee cup or measuring cup to save some pasta water, then drain pasta.
2. While the pasta cooks, coarsely chop the parsley, six anchovy fillets, scallions, capers (if using) and a pinch of salt. You can chop it all together on a cutting board, or pulse everything briefly together in the food processor; just make sure to keep it coarse.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium. Add oil, remaining four anchovies and half the garlic, and let cook, stirring, until anchovies start to dissolve, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in broccoli raab, tomato, about two-thirds of the parsley mixture and a pinch of salt to the pan. Saute until the raab is tender, 5 to 8 minutes, adding splashes of pasta water as the pan dries out. Taste and season with more salt if necessary.
5. Add pasta to pan along with butter, lemon zest, remaining garlic and red-pepper flakes. Toss until the butter melts and the pasta is combined with the vegetables, adding more pasta water if the mixture seems dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Divide pasta among bowls and sprinkle with remaining parsley mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with ricotta, if you like.

Texto completo: It's been widely accepted in the wine world for years that people can no longer be expected to age wines as they might have half a century ago.
For one thing, the wine-drinking public has changed enormously. Where once the market for wines that aged along glorious arcs was small, wealthy and dynastic, interest in wine today has become far more democratic.
Wine lovers no longer necessarily have cellars. Those who would enjoy drinking age-worthy wines are much more likely to live in fourth-floor walk-up apartments in Brooklyn or Tokyo than they are to occupy stately manors.
Restaurants could once be relied on to hold bottles in their own cellars until the wines were ready. Now, sommeliers must rush them to the wine list as soon as they are purchased, as they cannot risk delayed returns on their investments.
The world is awash in fascinating wines that require little or no aging at all. While many of these wines have ancient origins, their appearance in the global economy is relatively recent. And they are generally much less expensive than bottles for aging.
Confronted with these new realities, many producers of age-worthy wines changed their thinking. Rather than advise consumers to wait 10 years until they opened, say, a good Bordeaux -- as was the old custom -- they have altered their methods of production in an effort to make wines that can be enjoyed younger, that are no longer as tannic, astringent or impenetrable as they once were.
Even so, getting to know aged wines is a crucial step, if only to understand how aging affects wine.
For that, it's worth tasting wines at all levels of aging, from young through adolescence and middle age to doughty senescence. This is by no means easy or inexpensive, though certainly possible with long-term planning.
Even though many wines that once demanded aging -- whether Bordeaux, Barolo, Napa cabernet sauvignon or Burgundy -- can now be consumed younger, these wines still benefit from additional aging. Some, like Pomerol and Bandol, would certainly have been better with a few more years under their corks.
One category, however, tries to make life easier for all lovers of aged wine. That would be Rioja Gran Reserva, in which the rules of the appellation require that wines be aged at least five years by the producers before they can hit the market. Many are even older than that by the time they are sold.
This system of equating quality with age is out of step with current thinking that the potential of a wine is more a function of the distinctiveness of its terroir.
Within Rioja, a debate over this point drags on. More than a few producers no longer employ the official terms indicating a wine's aging before release, like crianza (three years), reserva (four years) and gran reserva.
Instead, some label wines simply by their provenance, as is now the custom in so many other parts of the world. Since these wines generally don't use label terminology like gran reserva, they are not bound to age the wines before sale, so they don't.
We are sympathetic to arguments in favor of terroir. Yet we also cherish traditional styles. And we are grateful that some of the greatest Rioja producers, like R. Lopez de Heredia, are simultaneously traditional and progressive. Lopez ages its gran reservas longer than any other producer before they are sold, but these wines are also identified as products of single vineyards.
I recommend three good examples of the wine: Faustino I Rioja Gran Reserva 2006, Bodegas Riojanas Rioja Gran Reserva Monte Real 2010 and La Rioja Alta Rioja Gran Reserva 904 2009.
Even with the presale aging in the cellars of the producers, these wines, still seemed relatively young. Yes, they can all be consumed with pleasure now, but their potential will not have been explored. Even gran reservas are generally purchased with the idea of aging them further.
So why are we opening these bottles now?
Well, they are at least a little older, the Faustino I more so than the others. And they convey a notion of what can happen early in the aging process.
They all share one characteristic that I love in gran reservas: a mellow, cushioned texture and flavor. That is, rather than the firm, possibly rugged, astringent tannins from grape and oak that you might sense in younger, age-worthy wines, the tannins in these wines feel as if they've been sanded down by time to a softer, more comfortable state.
In general, I don't much like the overt presence of oak in any wine, whether the darker tones of French oak, as is often encountered in more modern expressions of Rioja, or the paler, more herbal American oak, which is more typical of old-school Riojas.
But American oak seems to meld seamlessly with the fruit of traditional Riojas, which primarily comes from the tempranillo grape, often augmented by graciano, mazuelo or garnacha. Those last two grapes are better known to Americans by their French names, carignan and grenache.
This combination of grapes, oak and age gives gran reservas their characteristic burnished feeling, like a comfortable old leather chair in a warmly lighted, wood-paneled room.
The 2010 Monte Real, the youngest of the three wines, was 100% tempranillo. It was medium-bodied and not particularly concentrated, though its spicy, herbal flavors lingered in the mouth, as did its tannins. I liked its grace, and imagine it will develop complexity, but it did not strike me as a wine that would improve for decades.
How long might a Monte Real evolve? At a tasting of many old Monte Reals last year, bottles from 1942, 1955 and 1964 were absolutely gorgeous. I don't think the 2010 will make it that far.
The 2009 La Rioja Alta 904, 90% tempranillo and 10% graciano, was likewise spicy and herbal, with a soft fruit flavor, yet it had more concentration, complexity and intensity, with an underlying earthiness. This was a lovely wine now, but I think it will get much more interesting over the next 20 years.
The 2006 Faustino I -- 86% tempranillo, 9% graciano and 5% mazuelo -- was the oldest of the three. Judging by the color of the wine, just beginning to fade around the edges from ruby to brick, it was, not surprisingly, the most evolved.
Its tannins were still wound up, but the aroma was getting interesting, spicy with dried flowers and balsam. On the palate, it had the mellow fruit-and-oak combination I love, with a tobacco, mineral component as well.
I decanted each of these wines and drank them over the prolonged course of four days, just to see what would happen. They all improved, a further indication that these were still young, sturdy wines.

Texto completo: In just three books, the writing team of Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen have earned a reputation for highly entertaining psychological thrillers about women's friendships, obsessions and manipulation. Hendricks, a former editor at Simon & Schuster, and Pekkanen, a former journalist and author under her own name, know how to steer their novels to maximum effect with myriad twists. Although their method doesn't leave room for much character development, the energetic plots are tight and so inviting that each of their efforts has landed on the New York Times Bestsellers List.
Shay Miller drifts through life, eking out a living as a temp worker and sharing an apartment with a male friend on whom she has a crush but who is dating another woman. A market researcher obsessed with statistics, Shay was downsized from her full-time job and lost her apartment when she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her. Shay has few prospects and feels she's "caught in a slow spiral."
Her life changes when she watches in horror as Amanda Evinger throws herself in front of a Manhattan subway train. Although they were strangers, Shay becomes obsessed with Amanda, wanting to know everything about the deceased woman and what led her to commit suicide.
Shay finds out where Amanda lived and shows up at her memorial service. Glamorous sisters Jane and Cassandra Moore are quite interested in Shay and what relationship she may have had with Amanda. The Moore sisters have a tight circle of women who administer their own brand of vigilante justice on those who may have wronged one member of the group. They can't believe that Shay and Amanda had never met.
Shay is thrilled with the Moore sisters and their friends, who become her new best friends, giving her a new attitude toward life and belief in herself again. The sisters, and their friends, feel differently and see Shay as another target.
While the authors' last effort "The Wife Between Us" was a stronger effort, "You Are Not Alone" thrives on its twists and realistic tension. The solid plot overrides the deficiencies in characterization.
Meet the authors
Greer Hendricks and Sarah Pekkanen will discuss "You Are Not Alone" at 7 p.m. Feb. 26 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach; 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com.
Hendricks and Pekkanen along with Joseph Finder ("House on Fire"), Tim Mason ("The Darwin Affair") and Lynne Olson ("Madame Fourcade's Secret War") will be the guests during the Gilda Mallin Boca West Chapter of Hadassah's Annual Book and Author Luncheon beginning at 10 a.m. Feb. 27 at the Boca West Country Club, 20583 Boca West Drive, Boca Raton. Tickets are $110. For information, call 561-392-1658.

Winter's end is a good time to cook casseroles

Texto completo: Leap Year is a dirty trick to play on humanity, at least the way it has been practiced throughout history that is. Twenty-eight days is enough for February, a month known mostly for gray skies, frigid temperatures and the occasional blizzard. Throwing in an extra day is simply cruel.
Of course, I know the truth. Leap Year exists to correct for errors in the Gregorian Calendar. It seems that the earth does not take exactly 365 days to make one trip around the sun. To keep calendars from falling behind we add an extra day once every four years. This extra day is called a "Leap Day," and in 2020 it is scheduled for Saturday.
Oh joy. I'm not doubting the science. The earth is round, vaccines prevent disease, the climate is changing. I get all that. The logistics of Leap Year, however, could use a tweak. For example, why can't Leap Day come at the end of June? You know...when it's actually nice outside and we might welcome an extra 24-hours. In fact, we could start whole new traditions of Leap Day picnics and Leap Day cookouts. There could be Leap Day hot dog eating contests and Leap Day baseball games. Think of how happy we would all be.
But alas, we get February 29. Gray, cold, slippery February. Sigh.
All is not lost, however, and before any of you suggest that I get therapy to turn my frown upside down let's try and focus on the positive. For one thing, the days are getting longer. I almost don't feel like jumping into bed immediately after supper any more (note, I said "almost"). Something else that's good about February is perspective. Just the other day I told a friend that it was a beautiful day, even though the high temperature was expected to be just 25 degrees.
Then there's the food. One thing about June, you don't want to spend much time in the kitchen with a hot oven. In February, however, that oven feels divine. That extra heat is just the incentive we need to get cooking.
And what better food is there this time of year than the good old-fashioned homemade casserole? Casseroles are warm and gooey and just plain hearty. A meal in a pan, they fill you up with a bunch of leftovers for tomorrow.
Moreover, they are easy. Most casseroles can be made in less than an hour, which gives you more time to enjoy February. OK, so maybe that last point isn't such a good one.
Still, the casserole is still one of my favorite winter foods. Below you will find a few of my go-to's this time of year. They are one of the few things that make my February bearable.
Chicken and Biscuits This recipe comes from Diana Rattray at the website "The Spruce Eats" and it's one I've made several times this winter.
Unlike the chicken and biscuits I grew up with, everything here is baked together in one pan with the biscuits forming something of a crust on top. It's delightful, especially as the bottoms of the biscuits soak up the tasty sauce.
Ingredients
For the chicken:
2 large boneless chicken breasts
3 cups chicken broth
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
4 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup flour
1/4 to 1/2 cup heavy cream
1 to 1 1/2 cups frozen vegetables (use your favorite)
Salt and pepper to taste
For the biscuits:
2 cups flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons sugar
1 1/2 cups heavy cream
Prepare the chicken:
Put the chicken in a large lidded saucepan with the broth, onion, thyme and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through (about 20 minutes). Remove the chicken and strain the broth (reserve the broth).
Once the chicken is cool enough to touch, chop or shred it. Set aside.
Spray an 8 to 9-inch casserole pan with cooking spray. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Put the chopped/shredded chicken into the baking dish. Sprinkle the frozen veggies over the chicken. Set aside while you make the sauce.
In a saucepan melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour, and cook, stirring for 1-2 minutes. Gradually add 2 cups of the reserved chicken broth and continue cooking until thickened, stirring frequently. Add the heavy cream (start with 1/4 cup and add up to 1/2 a cup until you reach the desired consistency). Add salt and pepper to taste.
Pour the sauce over the chicken and vegetables in the baking dish.
Prepare the Biscuits:
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Use a fork to stir in the heavy cream until moistened. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead with your hands 3 or 4 times, just until the dough holds together.
Pat the dough into a circle that is about 1/2-inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter to cut out 2-inch biscuits (or whatever size biscuits you want). Arrange the biscuits over the top of your casserole. You need enough biscuits to cover the top, so keep rolling and cutting until you have enough.
Bake the chicken and biscuits for about 20-24 minutes, or until the biscuits begin to brown.
Serve hot.
Jambalya a la New York Times Luckily, this column doesn't appear in Louisiana. I have a feeling some real Creole folks would question my giving the name "jambalaya" to a dish that doesn't contain shrimp. Sorry. Still, this recipe is really tasty. It comes from the 1961 edition of "The New York Times Cook Book."
One note: You can use brown rice with this dish, but be sure to allow for additional baking time.
Ingredients
2 tablespoons shortening
1 cup chopped onion
1 cup chopped green or red pepper
2 cloves garlic
1 cup diced cooked chicken
1 cup diced cooked ham
1-pound Polish sausage, sliced into bite-sized pieces
2-14.5 ounce cans diced tomatoes, undrained
1 cup raw white rice
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/2 teaspoon thyme
1 tablespoon chopped parsley
1/4 teaspoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Melt the shortening in a large skilled. Add the onion, green pepper and garlic. Cook slowly, stirring often, until the onion and pepper are tender. Add the chicken, ham, and sausages and cook five minutes.
Add the tomatoes and their liquid. Add the rice, broth, thyme, parsley, chili powder, salt and pepper. Stir until the mixture is well combined.
Pour mixture into a large casserole. Cover and bake until the rice is tender, about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours.
Chicken and Noodles No casserole column would be complete without this blast from my past. This was my favorite meal growing up, mostly because of the crunchy cubes of bread that sit on top of the bubbly chicken. It's still a favorite today.
Ingredients
1 can cream of chicken soup
1/3 cup milk
1 cup cooked cubed chicken (or 5 oz. can of boned chicken)
1 cup cooked egg noodles
2-3 slices of bread, buttered
In a 1 1/2 quart casserole blend soup with milk. Add the chicken and the cooked noodles. Stir to mix everything together. Cut or tear the buttered bread into cubes. Sprinkle the cubes over the top of the casserole. Bake at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes.

Texto completo: Most anchovy pastas are minimalist things, born out of desperation with ingredients from the pantry. The assumption is that if you had anything else in the house, you'd surely cook that instead.
But true anchovy lovers beg to differ. For us, when anchovies are the starting point of a dish, they're also the star, making pasta so compelling that you won't want to relegate them to those nights when there's nothing in the fridge. You'll want to make them all the time.
I certainly do, loading anchovies into my pasta pot at least two or three times a month. (Actually, rare is the pasta that doesn't contain them.) I cook myriad variations, but the basic formula goes like this: Melt some anchovies and garlic into a pan of oil, then use that as the foundation for whatever sauce I want to build on.
In summer, there might be ripe tomatoes and herbs, or eggplant and peppers. In the fall, maybe mushrooms, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts. In winter, I like to use sturdy greens like broccoli raab, kale or spinach, which add vibrancy to the anchovies' umami funk.
In that last version, I also mix in some chopped cherry tomatoes for a little sweetness and color. Although I cook the anchovies and garlic in olive oil at the beginning of the dish, I stir in some butter at the end, which mellows the inherent bitterness of broccoli raab and rounds out the sauce.
A fat dollop of ricotta gives the pasta some creaminess, which I always crave when the weather gets cold, but it's not at all essential. And, while I love the saline tang of the capers, you can skip them if they are just one ingredient too many. With all those anchovies in the pan, you probably won't even miss them.
About those anchovies, for a dish like this, you need to get the good ones. I think the reason so many people are anti-anchovy is that there are a lot of bad, fishy ones on the market. Look for those packed in olive oil, and sample different brands until you find one you like. Then, stock up. After all, a pantry filled with anchovies is the beginning of many amazing future meals - no matter what other ingredients you have in the house.
Pasta with garlicky anchovies
and broccoli raab
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 30 minutes
Kosher salt
12 ounces short pasta, such as shells, wagon wheels or rigatoni
2 packed cups parsley, leaves and tender stems
10 anchovy fillets, preferably packed in olive oil (one 2-ounce tin)
1 small bunch scallions, white and green parts, chopped
2 tablespoons capers, drained (optional)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced to a paste
1 (1-pound) bunch broccoli raab, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (plum, cherry or grape work well)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Pinch of red-pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
Ricotta, for serving (optional)
1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions until 1 minute shy of al dente. Use a coffee cup or measuring cup to save some pasta water, then drain pasta.
2. While the pasta cooks, coarsely chop the parsley, six anchovy fillets, scallions, capers (if using) and a pinch of salt. You can chop it all together on a cutting board, or pulse everything briefly together in the food processor; just make sure to keep it coarse.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium. Add oil, remaining four anchovies and half the garlic, and let cook, stirring, until anchovies start to dissolve, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in broccoli raab, tomato, about two-thirds of the parsley mixture and a pinch of salt to the pan. Sauté until the raab is tender, 5 to 8 minutes, adding splashes of pasta water as the pan dries out. Taste and season with more salt if necessary.
5. Add pasta to pan along with butter, lemon zest, remaining garlic and red-pepper flakes. Toss until the butter melts and the pasta is combined with the vegetables, adding more pasta water if the mixture seems dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Divide pasta among bowls and sprinkle with remaining parsley mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with ricotta, if you like.

Beauty of 'Hair Love' Matthew Cherry on his Oscar win, Kobe Bryant and normalizing black life

Texto completo: It hasn't been long since Matthew Cherry, the Chicago native and NFL retiree turned entertainment sensation, won the Oscar for best animated short film for his charming movie "Hair Love," a story about a black father doing his young daughter's hair for the first time.
"Hair Love" was released in theaters in August and came out in December on social platforms. The film has received more than 20 million views on YouTube and has an accompanying picture book that became a New York Times bestseller.
Cherry, who directed and wrote the film, came back to Chicago recently for a screening of the movie and a panel discussion about black hair and black beauty. He was joined on the panel by Caroline Robinson, a cosmetic dermatologist; Ebony Jamison, a beauty, fashion and lifestyle blogger; and Amina Smith of Stadium Sports Network, who moderated the discussion.
Cherry sat down with the Tribune to talk about his Oscar win and what's next for him. The conversation has been edited for space and clarity.

Watching you and Sony executive and producer Karen Rupert Toliver- two black people with locs - walk up to the stage to receive the Oscar for "Hair Love" was a powerful moment. You all broughtDeAndre Arnold, and you talked about the CROWN Act in your speech. It really felt like the culmination of a moment. What kind of message do you think this sent?
Anytime you can have art meet real life action and change, with a story like DeAndre's and the story like the CROWN Act, it's just the best situation possible for a film. Our goal was to always try to help change the world, and try to have young black boys and girls see themselves in this medium of animation, which often is the first medium of film that most kids are introduced to.
When you don't see yourselves in these mediums, it really can do a number to your self-confidence. There are so many stories of young kids saying they want their hair straight like their favorite character and just things that may not seem damaging at the time. For us, we wanted a character in Zuri (the daughter in the film) who was very proud of her hair; you can tell she got it from her mom, and her dad, as well, who has locs and tattoos and looks like any young black man you would see today.
We just wanted people to see themselves in the project.

Some would say you kind of "spoke into existence" your Oscar win with some clairvoyant tweets. What was that winning moment like for you, knowing how long the journey had been of starting "Hair Love" from a Kickstarter?
Eight years ago, it was a little darker time in my career. I just did my first feature and was trying to figure out what would happen next. I didn't get the same love that a lot of other filmmakers get after their first films, so I was kind of considering giving it up. I didn't have a lot of followers on Twitter at the time, so I could just put stuff out there almost like a journal. So for it to happen - when I tell you it all felt like a dream, and still does - it hasn't really, truly hit me.
I had to go right back into work the very same day. I had to bring it with me (on the set of "Mixed-ish"); I didn't even get a chance to go home. Light flex, light flex. It was cool, though, too, because for the most part, how many times are you ever going to see an Oscar in your life? It was cool seeing the cast and crew be inspired.

You dedicated your award to Kobe Bryant. What does it mean to you to have won in the same category he did just two years ago?
Kelly Carter, an ESPN writer made the connection that he was the first former athlete and I was the second. Kobe actually retweeted it, it was one of his last tweets; he said, "Let's go." He was very supportive. I think it just goes to his mentality: He didn't see it as competition but as another young brother trying to come up and he wanted to support. I hoped he may present the category.
For me, he represents everybody who has a strong second act in their career; he always talked about wanting to be a storyteller. Even when he won his Oscar two years ago, backstage you could tell he was like a kid, he was just so honored to be there. Because there was that connection of both being a former athlete, I really wanted to honor him, and show him that obviously what he did blazed the path and now we just got to keep the ball going.

Black men and their sons have a special bond with their hair as well, so I'm curious what made you choose to focus on a father-daughter relationship in "Hair Love"?
Back in 2016, I came across a really amazing image of what looked like an Afro-Brazilian father, and his daughter was sitting in his lap and she had these two afropuffs. How they also say little girls are "daddy's little girl" and little boys are "mama's little boy," there's just something about that dynamic that is always so special. I saw that image; that's when I initially had the idea for the project, and then I tried to make it happen. A year later, for whatever reason, it fell off; then I came across all these videos of dads doing their daughters' hair. For me it was like if we can capture that same magic that is helping these videos go viral, then we'll be in good shape. I think that's what we did.

In your speech you mentioned "Hair Love" being born out of wanting to normalize black hair. Do you have anything else in the works that will continue moving that mission forward?
In all my work I always try to normalize black life. Typically it's smaller, slices-of-life stuff, stories that show us just being us and just us existing. And that act in itself is radical because so often we have the burden of our entire race when we're doing films, where we have to represent for everybody. And I think the more we just normalize each other's stories, I just think the world will be a better place.

Texto completo: Rather than fretting over whether straight America is ready to accept former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's happy, loving, gay marriage - as talk show host Rush Limbaugh has been doing - straight America may want to take a cue or two from same-sex marriages, which are statistically some of the happiest around.
Social scientist Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education for the Council on Contemporary Families, analyzed data from several recent studies on the satisfaction and stability rates of couples in heterosexual, gay and lesbian marriages. Men married to other men reported the lowest levels of psychological distress in their marriages. Women married to men reported the highest levels of strain.
Gay and lesbian couples, Coontz found, tend to approach conflicts with more humor and affection, spend less time criticizing and lecturing each other and offer each other more praise and encouragement, compared with their heterosexual counterparts.
"As a marriage historian," Coontz told me, "it seems to me we're totally entering uncharted territory. Never before in history have we tried to do marriage in a way that is totally free from dictation by our biology - whether we can or can't have babies; whether we have to have babies - or by legal assignments that only husbands can do this and only wives can do that. It's the first time we've really tried to build marriages that were not laid out for us by law and hundreds of years of customs."
Why not build them into the happiest, healthiest unions they can be?
"Since same-sex couples can't use imputed male-female differences to sort out who does what, they rely less on stereotypes," Coontz wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece. "Heterosexual parents tend to see tasks such as child care and laundry as part of a package that is handed to one partner. Same-sex couples are far more likely to each take on some traditionally 'feminine' and some 'masculine' chores."
She cited a 2015 time-use survey that found 74% of same-sex couples shared routine child care equally, compared with 38% of straight couples.
"It's not a question of good or bad, villains or victims," Coontz told me. "It's a question of whether we can look at other models and say, 'Huh. How do you do it when you don't know that women's work is this and men's work is this?' "
The University of Texas sociologist Debra Umberson co-authored one of the studies Coontz analyzed. Umberson's work focuses less on the division of housework and child care and more on emotional labor.
Women spend more time taking the emotional temperature of their partners and their marriages than men do, Umberson found, and that's true whether women are married to men or women are married to other women. Men - gay or straight - tend to do less preemptive emotional wellness check-ins with their spouses. ("How are you feeling? Do you need to talk?")
Neither style is inherently good or bad. But conflict can arise when one partner's style differs dramatically from the other partner's, and that tends to happen more, statistically speaking, in heterosexual marriages.
"It's kind of stressful to constantly be aware of someone's emotional needs and respond to them," Umberson told me. "But even if it's a little bit hard and a little bit stressful, if it's reciprocated and there's love in the relationship, then it can be a really positive thing."
But not always an easy thing.
"Because of 200 years of rigid socialization, these roles have been around long enough that we fall into habits even if we want to do things differently," Coontz said. "We have 200 years of driving our wagon down exactly the same road, and the ruts have gotten pretty deep. So it takes some effort to pull into the new lane, so to speak."
Coontz says it's valuable to keep those centuries of socialization in mind when we're interacting with the opposite sex.
"Men have been told for 200 years that the way you show love is to explain things, to protect and to provide," she said. "And women have been told to listen and check in and do all these emotional care tasks. We've been socialized to think that we're so different from one another, and it's easy to slide into defensiveness."
Same-sex couples, on the other hand, are partnerships between two people who haven't spent their entire lives being told how mysterious and unknowable (and unreasonable) their partners are.
Now that same-sex marriages have been legal across the nation for close to five years, all marriages can benefit from research that explores their ins and outs, ups and downs.
"Relationships are so variable, and you can't say one group does it all better and one group does it all worse," Coontz said. "But the more we can look at each other's styles of problem-solving and relating and mix and match - not try to imitate, just mix and match - what works for us in our individual relationships, the better off we'll be."
Love is, indeed, a many splendored thing.

Startups fizzle, tech humbled Pullbacks taking hold in many of the same areas that drew the most hype

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the past decade, technology startups grew so quickly that they couldn't hire people fast enough.
Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs.
Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.
"It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.
It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.
Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods.
Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.
Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.
Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which track startups.
And those are not the only signs of change.
Casper Sleep, which billed itself as the "Nike of sleep" by selling mattresses online, flopped when it went public this month. Once-hot companies like Lime, the electric scooter provider, have pulled out of some cities. Others, like e-commerce startup Brandless, game app HQ Trivia and electronics maker Essential Products, are on the verge of shutting down.
There are now "frantic mini-moments of panic, as one thing after another happens," said Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg's venture arm in San Francisco. "At some point, one rock after another will fall away from the cliff, and we'll realize we're not standing on anything in many, many companies."
Many startups are sagging after a difficult 2019, when prominent "unicorns" - companies valued at $1 billion or more by private investors - fell flat on Wall Street.
Uber and Lyft, which are losing billions of dollars a year, staged disappointing initial public offerings last spring. And WeWork, the office rental firm, pulled its public offering, ousted its chief executive and cut its valuation by 80% late last year.
The retreats are being led by companies that were backed by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate with a $100 billion Vision Fund for investing in startups. SoftBank bet big on companies like Uber and WeWork, as well as Colombian delivery startup Rappi and Indian hospitality startup Oyo.
All have undergone layoffs in recent months.
The pullback will probably not be as severe as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, when dozens of unprofitable internet firms failed.

Texto completo: Monday's 1,031-point stock market plunge certainly brought panic to financiers, traders, policymakers and investors. But did the long stock market rise parallel the fortunes of America's real economy?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average skyrocketed by more than 20,000 points since its low in March 2009, enriching big investors and enabling President Donald Trump to claim that "our economy is the best it has ever been." Someone who invested $10 million in an index fund in 2009 would now have more than $50 million. Not bad. Unfortunately, what's happening on Wall Street has little or no day-to-day relevance to most Americans.
"Journalists are obsessed with the stock market," says Jacob Hacker, director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale University. "But for most Americans, it's a side show in their economic lives. What really matters to them is the security of their jobs and health care, and the amount they have to pay for big-ticket items like housing and education."
Real wages for the typical American worker have risen by a mere 5% during the past decade and, in fact, are only about 11% higher than they were in 1979, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
More than 2 out of 5 American workers are in low-wage jobs, defined as less than two-thirds of the median wage. They toil in restaurants, as health aides and janitors. The people who clean sports stadiums make about $14 per hour, picking up trash from sports fans who may pay hundreds of dollars to sit on the 50-yard line.
Most low-wage workers are women and people of color, although there are many white male workers who have low-paying jobs. Of the 11 million single mothers in the United States, 29% live in poverty.
Nearly half of all workers do not have a retirement savings plan and, for many, employer-provided health insurance comes with ever higher deductibles and co-pays.
Of course, for the half of working Americans with a 401(k) account, today's stock market decline does mean a loss. But the real problem is the inability of many workers to save, as the median 401(k) balance is just $36,000 for 40- to 49-year-olds with these retirement plans.
Tens of millions of low-income Americans have more than their share of strikes against them: They were formerly incarcerated. They are substance abusers. Millions are jobless, have given up looking for jobs and are out of the workforce, not counted in official unemployment statistics. Millions of working young adults live with their parents because they can't afford to rent a small apartment.
The Wuhan coronavirus and its impact on the Chinese economy – and potential impact on the global economy – are cited as the major reasons for Monday's stock market sell-off. However, it is poor, low-wage and even many middle-class Americans who are more likely to be in poor health and have a significantly shorter life expectancy than those who have higher incomes and are well educated. The richest American men live 15 years longer than the poorest.
As inequality has grown, the top one-fifth of earners account for about 55% on the nation's annual income.
Since investments in equities represent wealth, the wealth comparisons are even more glaring. The top 1% hold nearly 40% of the country's wealth, significantly more than the middle 60% of the income distribution. If those at the top bewail the millions in stock-market investments wiped out Monday, remember: 2 out of 5 households do not have enough savings to make ends meet for three months at the poverty level if they had no income.
Today was an awful day for investors, but too many Americans don't have the savings to participate in the stock market at all. For them, today's calamity means little.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the past decade, technology startups grew so quickly that they couldn't hire people fast enough.
Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs.
Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.
"It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.
It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.
Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods.
Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.
Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.
Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which track startups.
And those are not the only signs of change.
Casper Sleep, which billed itself as the "Nike of sleep" by selling mattresses online, flopped when it went public this month. Once-hot companies like Lime, the electric scooter provider, have pulled out of some cities. Others, like e-commerce startup Brandless, game app HQ Trivia and electronics maker Essential Products, are on the verge of shutting down.
There are now "frantic mini-moments of panic, as one thing after another happens," said Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg's venture arm in San Francisco. "At some point, one rock after another will fall away from the cliff, and we'll realize we're not standing on anything in many, many companies."
Many startups are sagging after a difficult 2019, when prominent "unicorns" - companies valued at $1 billion or more by private investors - fell flat on Wall Street.
Uber and Lyft, which are losing billions of dollars a year, staged disappointing initial public offerings last spring. And WeWork, the office rental firm, pulled its public offering, ousted its chief executive and cut its valuation by 80% late last year.
The retreats are being led by companies that were backed by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate with a $100 billion Vision Fund for investing in startups. SoftBank bet big on companies like Uber and WeWork, as well as Colombian delivery startup Rappi and Indian hospitality startup Oyo.
All have undergone layoffs in recent months.
The pullback will probably not be as severe as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, when dozens of unprofitable internet firms failed.

Texto completo: On March 4, 1841,
Harrison gave the longest inaugural address in history (8,445 words). To show how hardy he was, he wore no overcoat, hat or gloves in the freezing temperatures. Harrison caught pneumonia and died on April 4, after just 31 days in office.
NORTH BEND, Ohio – You might consider the parade here earlier this month the equivalent of a participation trophy.
Of the 45 presidents the nation honored on Presidents Day, none served as short a term as William Henry Harrison. He died just 31 days into his presidency and is buried in a tomb overlooking the Ohio River in this town 15 miles west of Cincinnati.
Despite a term so short that he left no imprint on the presidency itself, Harrison is still honored every year with a parade sometime around his Feb. 9 birthday.
This year's featured the usual honor guard, marching members of a local Sons of the American Revolution chapter, and wreath-laying at the former president's tomb.
Robert Ruehlman, a local judge and North Bend resident who helps organize the parade, said it's important to remember Harrison beyond even his time as president.
"He was an important figure in the war of 1812 and he was the first presidential candidate to use a slogan," Ruehlman said. That slogan: "Tippecanoe and Tyler too." (Tippecanoe was a battle Harrison fought in; Tyler was John Tyler, his running mate.)
Harrison, a Whig, can claim to be the answer to variety of historical trivia: he was the first president from Ohio, the grandfather of a later president (Benjamin Harrison,) and a pioneer when it came to presidential campaigns – chiefly by exaggerating his record.
In her biography "William Henry Harrison," author Gail Collins, the New York Times columnist and Green Township native, said, "Politically, Harrison's greatest achievement was to star in what is still celebrated as one of the most ridiculous presidential campaigns in history,"
He's also a key figure in a new mystery.
A sword he carried at his inauguration that was used in the Revolutionary War by his father-in-law, John Cleves Symmes, disappeared for decades – until it turned up at a Connecticut auction last year. It was seized until authorities can answer the question: was it stolen, as local historians suggest, or was the seller the true owner. The FBI is investigating.
On March 4, 1841, Harrison gave the longest inaugural address in history (8,445 words). To show how hardy he was, he wore no overcoat, hat or gloves in the freezing temperatures.
Harrison caught pneumonia and died on April 4, after just 31 days in office.
At this year's parade and wreath-laying, North Bend's mayor Douglas Sammons said Harrison would have a message for the nation if he were alive today.
"In our present day, the United States seems to have become a more polarized country," Sammons said. "Even when we disagree, it does not mean we should be disagreeable. If President Harrison was alive today, I do not think he would appreciate where our country's discourse is."

Despite his short time in office, William Henry Harrison was also an important figure in the war of 1812, and was the first presidential candidate to use a slogan.
A birthday tribute was held in honor of President William Henry Harrison at his memorial site in North Bend, on Friday, February 7. Participants, including the Hamilton County Sheriff's Honor Guard and Sons of the American Revolution Cincinnati Chapter, marched together from North Bend's Council Hall building to the President William Henry Harrison Memorial Site where a short ceremony was held and wreaths were presented.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Sen. Bernie Sanders warned that in his quest for the White House, he would not only take on Republicans and President Donald Trump but the Democratic establishment.
Now that Sanders has found success in the first three presidential contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, some Democrats have begun reckoning with the idea that Sanders, a democratic socialist running on liberal ideals such as "Medicare for All," may be the 2020 Democratic nominee instead of a more moderate candidate. For them, the consequences could extend beyond the presidential contest.
Moderate Democrats worry that Sanders' name at the top of the general election ticket would make it harder for Democrats running for Congress, which could threaten their majority in the House and make it nearly impossible to take the Senate.
"I get that Team Trump is going to go after whoever we nominate, but if we’re going to go with a socialist, it’s like we’re leading with our chin," Democratic strategist Jim Manley said. "It’s going to be so easy to demonize the entire ballot. "
Democrats vying for Senate seats and the House Democrats who won in districts Trump carried in 2016 will have to "fight like hell to escape the connotation of the socialist thing, which is going to be awfully hard," Manley said.
Constituents 'don't want socialism'
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala. , an endangered Democrat in the Senate, said he will differentiate himself from whoever is at the top of the ticket. Though Sanders has had success, the nomination is still up for grabs, Jones said, and predicting who will lead the ticket in November is like "walking up to a roulette wheel. "
"We're gonna make sure we do all the right things to make sure that my race is my race," Jones said, highlighting his focus on issues important to his constituents in Alabama. "I've differentiated myself since I've got here. I think the one thing about my two years in the Senate is that people are pretty clear that while I am a Democrat, I vote my conscience No. 1, and I vote what I think is in the best interest of the people of Alabama. "
Across the country in swing districts, House members have pushed back on Sanders, criticizing his policies and praise for some aspects of Fidel Castro's Cuba.
Sanders told CBS' "60 Minutes" it was "unfair to simply say everything is bad" in communist Cuba. "When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?" Sanders said.
Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, D-Fla. , who represents a swing district and a large Cuban American community in Miami-Dade, tweeted that the senator's comments were "absolutely unacceptable. "
"The Castro regime murdered and jailed dissidents, and caused unspeakable harm to too many South Florida families," she wrote on Twitter. "To this day, it remains an authoritarian regime that oppresses its people, subverts the free press, and stifles a free society. "
Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N. J. , called Sanders' remarks "outrageous. "
“I'm sure all of those who died at Castro's hands and were shot at firing squads, all those who were tortured, those who live in my state and suffered enormously under the regime, the more than a million people who fled, I'm sure they all think that the literacy program was worth all of that," he said.
"If that's going to be his foreign policy," Menendez said, "then we're doomed. "
"South Carolinians don’t want socialism," Rep. Joe Cunningham, who represents a district in South Carolina that went to Trump in 2016, told The Post and Courier. When asked whether he'd support Sanders should he win the nomination, Cunningham said that would not happen. "Bernie Sanders will not be the nominee," he said.
Another endangered House Democrat, Rep. Anthony Brindisi, D-N. Y. , said he wouldn't support Sanders or fellow liberal candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. , explaining to his local newspaper, the Post-Standard in Syracuse, that it would be "exceedingly difficult" for them to win against Trump.
"I don’t think the people that I represent are looking for a president who supports abolishing private health insurance companies, and I don’t either," Brindisi told the newspaper's editorial board.
Concerns and divisions in the party
Some said the panic over Sanders is overblown.
He has mostly led Trump in head-to-head polling, and this week, Roll Call said it downgraded Republicans' chances of regaining the House because of poor recruitment efforts and strong fundraising by Democrats.
Kyle Kondik, the managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, which provides a nonpartisan analysis on elections, said although moderates are weary of Sanders' wins, they should take note of Trump's approval ratings.
"Even if Americans ultimately decide [Trump is] the lesser of two evils this fall, there may be some voters who back him only tepidly or anticipate his victory and don’t want his party to have total control of the government," Kondik wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times. "That may work to the benefit of House Democrats, even as they now panic – rightly or wrongly – over the possibility of sharing the ballot with Mr. Sanders. "
At a CNN town hall Monday, Sanders took a poll of the audience, asking whether his policy ideas, such as raising the minimum wage and making college tuition free, were too "extreme. " Each time, those in the crowd shouted, "No. "
"I know if you look at the media, they say, 'Bernie's ideas are radical and extreme,' " he said. "Let me just say I don't think that's true. "
Those concerned about what a Sanders nomination could do to Washington hold out hope for the South Carolina primary Saturday and Super Tuesday, when more than a third of the delegates needed to win the nomination are up for grabs.
When asked about a potential Sanders nomination, lawmakers and aides pointed to the upcoming contests and stressed that more moderate candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, would see success.
"I'm looking forward to the results of the next debate and the South Carolina primary, which I think will show that this is a contest between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders," said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del. , who endorsed Biden. "They have competing visions for the future of our party. "
Some Democrats have applauded Sanders' wins and the coalition he built to energize a diverse group of supporters that could help in a fight against Trump.
The division in the party is reminiscent of the quarreling among House Democrats last year after the rise of a group of liberal lawmakers.
The four female freshman lawmakers who called themselves "the Squad," which included Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , took on leadership and pressured their colleagues to take more liberal stances on issues such as immigration and climate change. Ocasio-Cortez is one of Sanders' most prominent surrogates on the campaign trail.
The feud ended with liberals largely falling in line behind party leadership, but the intra-party debate this round may be different.

Anchovies in starring role Use them as starting point in pasta dish

Texto completo: Most anchovy pastas are minimalist things, born out of desperation with ingredients from the pantry. The assumption is that if you had anything else in the house, you'd surely cook that instead.
But true anchovy lovers beg to differ. For us, when anchovies are the starting point of a dish, they're also the star, making pasta so compelling that you won't want to relegate them to those nights when there's nothing in the fridge. You'll want to make them all the time.
I certainly do, loading anchovies into my pasta pot at least two or three times a month. (Actually, rare is the pasta that doesn't contain them.) I cook myriad variations, but the basic formula goes like this: Melt some anchovies and garlic into a pan of oil, then use that as the foundation for whatever sauce I want to build on.
In summer, there might be ripe tomatoes and herbs, or eggplant and peppers. In the fall, maybe mushrooms, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts. In winter, I like to use sturdy greens like broccoli raab, kale or spinach, which add vibrancy to the anchovies' umami funk.
In that last version, I also mix in some chopped cherry tomatoes for a little sweetness and color. Although I cook the anchovies and garlic in olive oil at the beginning of the dish, I stir in some butter at the end, which mellows the inherent bitterness of broccoli raab and rounds out the sauce.
A fat dollop of ricotta gives the pasta some creaminess, which I always crave when the weather gets cold, but it's not at all essential. And, while I love the saline tang of the capers, you can skip them if they are just one ingredient too many. With all those anchovies in the pan, you probably won't even miss them.
About those anchovies, for a dish like this, you need to get the good ones. I think the reason so many people are anti-anchovy is that there are a lot of bad, fishy ones on the market. Look for those packed in olive oil, and sample different brands until you find one you like. Then, stock up. After all, a pantry filled with anchovies is the beginning of many amazing future meals - no matter what other ingredients you have in the house.
Pasta with garlicky anchovies
and broccoli raab
Makes: 4 servings Total time: 30 minutes
Kosher salt
12 ounces short pasta, such as shells, wagon wheels or rigatoni
2 packed cups parsley, leaves and tender stems
10 anchovy fillets, preferably packed in olive oil (one 2-ounce tin)
1 small bunch scallions, white and green parts, chopped
2 tablespoons capers, drained (optional)
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
4 garlic cloves, finely grated or minced to a paste
1 (1-pound) bunch broccoli raab, trimmed and chopped into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup chopped fresh tomato (plum, cherry or grape work well)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest
Pinch of red-pepper flakes
Freshly ground black pepper
Ricotta, for serving (optional)
1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package instructions until 1 minute shy of al dente. Use a coffee cup or measuring cup to save some pasta water, then drain pasta.
2. While the pasta cooks, coarsely chop the parsley, six anchovy fillets, scallions, capers (if using) and a pinch of salt. You can chop it all together on a cutting board, or pulse everything briefly together in the food processor; just make sure to keep it coarse.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium. Add oil, remaining four anchovies and half the garlic, and let cook, stirring, until anchovies start to dissolve, about 1 minute.
4. Stir in broccoli raab, tomato, about two-thirds of the parsley mixture and a pinch of salt to the pan. Sauté until the raab is tender, 5 to 8 minutes, adding splashes of pasta water as the pan dries out. Taste and season with more salt if necessary.
5. Add pasta to pan along with butter, lemon zest, remaining garlic and red-pepper flakes. Toss until the butter melts and the pasta is combined with the vegetables, adding more pasta water if the mixture seems dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Divide pasta among bowls and sprinkle with remaining parsley mixture. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with ricotta, if you like.

Startups fizzle, tech humbled Pullbacks taking hold in many of the same areas that drew the most hype

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Over the past decade, technology startups grew so quickly that they couldn't hire people fast enough.
Now the layoffs have started coming in droves. Last month, robot pizza startup Zume and car-sharing company Getaround slashed more than 500 jobs.
Then DNA testing company 23andMe, logistics startup Flexport, Firefox maker Mozilla and question-and-answer website Quora did their own cuts.
"It feels like a reckoning is here," said Josh Wolfe, a venture capitalist at Lux Capital in New York.
It's a humbling shift for an industry that long saw itself as an engine of job creation and innovation, producing ride-hailing giant Uber, hospitality company Airbnb and other now well-known brands that often disrupted entrenched industries.
Their rise was propelled by a wave of investor money - about $763 billion washed into startups in the United States over the past decade - that also fueled the growth of young companies in delivery, cannabis, real estate and direct-to-consumer goods.
Unlike low-cost software startups, these private companies frequently took on old-line competitors by spending heavily on physical assets and workers while losing money.
Now a pullback is unfolding in precisely the areas that drew the most hype.
Around the world, more than 30 startups have slashed more than 8,000 jobs over the past four months, according to a tally by The New York Times.
Investments in young companies have fallen, with 2,215 startups raising money in the United States in the last three months of 2019, the fewest since late 2016, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook, which track startups.
And those are not the only signs of change.
Casper Sleep, which billed itself as the "Nike of sleep" by selling mattresses online, flopped when it went public this month. Once-hot companies like Lime, the electric scooter provider, have pulled out of some cities. Others, like e-commerce startup Brandless, game app HQ Trivia and electronics maker Essential Products, are on the verge of shutting down.
There are now "frantic mini-moments of panic, as one thing after another happens," said Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg's venture arm in San Francisco. "At some point, one rock after another will fall away from the cliff, and we'll realize we're not standing on anything in many, many companies."
Many startups are sagging after a difficult 2019, when prominent "unicorns" - companies valued at $1 billion or more by private investors - fell flat on Wall Street.
Uber and Lyft, which are losing billions of dollars a year, staged disappointing initial public offerings last spring. And WeWork, the office rental firm, pulled its public offering, ousted its chief executive and cut its valuation by 80% late last year.
The retreats are being led by companies that were backed by SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate with a $100 billion Vision Fund for investing in startups. SoftBank bet big on companies like Uber and WeWork, as well as Colombian delivery startup Rappi and Indian hospitality startup Oyo.
All have undergone layoffs in recent months.
The pullback will probably not be as severe as the dot-com bust in the early 2000s, when dozens of unprofitable internet firms failed.

Texto completo: The most recent "Planet of the Apes" movie airs on FXX. And the comedian Amy Hoggart stars in a new show on TruTV.
What's on TV
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017) 9 p.m. on FXX. The new big-screen adaptation of Jack London's "The Call of the Wild" shares an actor with "War for the Planet of the Apes," but you won't see his face in either movie: He's Terry Notary, a motion-capture performer whose movements provided the basis for the digital dog that stars opposite Harrison Ford in "The Call of the Wild," and who played one of Andy Serkis's chimpanzee companions in the "Planet of the Apes" movies of the 2010s. "War for the Planet of the Apes," the most recent one of those, completes the story of Caesar, the chimpanzee revolutionary played by Serkis. It hinges on a rivalry between Caesar and an angry human colonel played by Woody Harrelson. (Caesar spends much of the series proving that he has more humanity than the humans in it, who want to wipe out his species.) "The motion-captured, digitally sculpted apes are so natural, so expressive, so beautifully integrated into their environment, that you almost forget to be astonished by the nuances of thought and emotion that flicker across their faces, often seen in close-up," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.
THE LEGEND OF TARZAN (2016) 5:30 p.m. on TNT. More digital apes and human villains can be found in this Tarzan rethink, which casts Alexander Skarsgard as a version of that literary son of nature. Directed by David Yates, this take on the story is built loosely around history: It pairs Skarsgard's Tarzan with a fictionalized version of the 19th-century American George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), who publicly denounced the violent colonialism led by King Leopold II of Belgium in Central Africa. The plot pits Tarzan and Williams against Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), an oppressor in a white suit.
IT'S PERSONAL WITH AMY HOGGART 10 p.m. on TBS and TruTV. The sometimes "Full Frontal With Samantha Bee" correspondent Amy Hoggart helps a New York executive develop her sense of humor in the first episode of this new comedy-documentary series, which chronicles Hoggart's attempts to help people work through common issues. Highlights of the episode include a scene in which an expert breaks down the psychological effects of a goofy knock-knock joke. Its punchline revolves around Sean Connery.
What's Streaming
WEST SIDE STORY (1961) Stream on Starz platforms; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The Times's dance critic, Gia Kourlas, wrote an article this week about how Jerome Robbins's choreography is missed in the current production of "West Side Story" on Broadway. "What Robbins created wasn't just a series of dances, however peerless," she wrote, "but an overarching view of how, beyond anything else, movement could tell a story." See some of that choreography in action in this classic film version of the musical, which followed Robbins's original Broadway production. This isn't purely Robbins's vision, though: He was fired before the film was completed, and shares the directing credit with Robert Wise.

Texto completo: It's not that I enjoy wagging my finger when Los Angeles is stereotyped by outsiders who know nothing about us.
But once again, duty calls.
The culprit here, unsurprisingly, is an East Coast media outlet.

The gist of an article published this week by the New York Times, as far as I can tell, is that we are prone to over-hugging here in La La Land. It is a first-person account in which the author, a New Yorker currently living in California, describes being hugged by a shaman.
"If the involvement of a shaman hadn't tipped you off already," the story continues, "that hug occurred in Los Angeles."
Actually, what that comment tipped me off to is that the story was written by a New Yorker. Raise your hand if you live in Los Angeles and you've ever been hugged by a shaman. I thought not.
At this point, I had a few options. I could stop reading. I could begin writing a letter to the editor of the New York Times pleading for the paper to please stop. Or I could keep reading in the same way I might keep watching a car chase that cannot end well.
I kept reading.
"But the shaman was not an outlier," we are told. "In my entirely unscientific research, this is the way that some people in Los Angeles -- you know, the cliched touchy-feely types the city has always been associated with -- seem to greet each other."
I would like to address each of the things wrong with that sentence, but I don't have six pages of space to work with. So let's just move on.
We are introduced to a 30-year-old Sherman Oaks publicist who says her hugs typically last between seven and 10 seconds, which makes one wonder if she carries a stopwatch. Then we get a 25-year-old recent transplant who says, "I got a hug from a girl waiting in line to use the bathroom last weekend."
As if we needed more evidence that this was not a scientific survey.
The author is rolling now, stringing anecdotes, stereotypes and generalizations together in search of a clever observation that never quite materializes.
"Call it the 'L.A. hug,' " we are told, which sets up this:
"It's easy to see how, in the land of sunshine and MoonJuice, heart chakras and alternative milks -- where most people spend most of their lives in their vehicles -- there would be a common need for, well, human contact."
This writer, I should point out, is apparently in California to write about gender and culture, which is difficult to do when you lean so heavily on sunshine and MoonJuice while missing the many wonders of, well, the deep and expansive local culture.
Another expert source in the hugging story, who lives not in Los Angeles but in New York, offers this explanation of L.A. residents' alleged need to embrace:
"They're gluten deprived."
A twentysomething friend of the author describes three-minute hugs from the dealer who sells her psychedelic mushrooms. And a childhood friend of Jennifer Aniston, who hosts "goddess circles," describes endless hugs that facilitate conversation.
Against my better instincts, I have not canceled my subscription to the New York Times, because there is some darn good reporting sprinkled in with this kind of ludicrous punditry about California.
Other Angelenos shared my disgust.
"Sick unsubstantiated claims," one person said on Twitter. "There's not a single reference to the number of people who hug versus the number who don't."
"I am really curious about this 'Los Angeles' that the NYT keeps writing about," another tweet said. "I've never been there."
We did actually have one inveterate hugger in L.A. I'm talking about legislator Bob Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley in Sacramento and was once referred to as "Huggy Bear" for his signature embraces.
But he retired from hugging some years ago, when the appropriateness of his greetings came into question.
I have hugged on occasion, and been hugged. But no more so than when I lived in New York City and Philadelphia. In the latter, I must admit, there was quite a bit of hugging by people who suspected they were the targets of criminal investigations. The hug was a way to feel for concealed recording devices and avoid prison time rather than to fill a need for human contact.
It's possible, I thought, that I'm the one who doesn't get Los Angeles. Maybe there is more hugging than I was aware of. So on Tuesday, I drove from southwest to northeast, looking for huggers.
I didn't find any. I did, however, find that traffic is pretty bad, which might be the subject of the NYT's next expose.
My research was perhaps no more scientific than that of the New York Times writer, but I did talk to 10 people, not one of whom believed there was more hugging in Los Angeles than anywhere else. But then, none of them was drinking MoonJuice, communing with a shaman or buying 'shrooms, so they might not be living in the hugging bubble.
Actually, I did see one hug. A security guard at the Crenshaw Imperial Center strip mall hugged a high school student who was leaving a charter high school.
"More huggin' means more lovin' is going on," said Melia Nash, although the security guard discounted the likelihood that we are particularly hug-prone in L.A.
Jose and Adriana Romo were holding hands on their way to lunch, but they looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if we seemed to have a hugging problem here.
At 71st and Crenshaw, LAPD Officer David Heilman told me he's a hugger.
"I hug my wife, my son and my dog," he said, but when writing tickets for moving violations, he said, he holds off on the embraces.
At Pan Pacific Park, I found Heather Hannasch, who was visiting from Dallas, with her friend Melissa Pearson, who lives in Santa Clarita.
Hannasch said she thinks there's more hugging in Dallas than in L.A., a tip which I offer free of charge to the NYT culture reporter, should she choose to expand the scope of her work.
Pearson, meanwhile, said she thinks of L.A. as a place where it's hard to connect, let alone do much hugging.
At the mall in Eagle Rock, Biddhut Barua said he's from India, which has more of a handshake culture, but he said he also hasn't found L.A. to be one big hugging party. Jennifer Payne said she's a local who once lived in Texas, where there was more hugging than here.
And Pete Huang and Chris Zhao, visiting from their home in Santa Barbara, said there's more hugging in Santa Barbara than in L.A. because it's a small community and people tend to know each other well enough to hug upon meeting.
I got a late start on this column and tried unsuccessfully to reach out to the New York Times writer for comment.
When I first got to L.A., there were probably more than a few things I didn't understand about this place.
Twenty years later, I appreciate how difficult a metropolis it is to define in simple terms.
It defies stereotyping and begs you to challenge your own narrow perspective and celebrate its many wonders.
If you agree, send a nice note.
But I will not be accepting any hugs, even if you happen to be a shaman.

Texto completo: Campaign veterans reacted to how the Democratic presidential candidates fared Tuesday night.
Twitter can't tell us whether, or how, Tuesday's debate might change voters' minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and analysts. Here's a rundown, with the candidates listed in alphabetical order.
Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Biden has never needed a good debate performance as badly as he did tonight, heading toward a must-win primary in South Carolina with a zero-for-three record so far.
And while commentators cringed at some moments -- particularly when he claimed credit for writing a bill that Amy Klobuchar actually wrote -- the consensus was that he got what he needed.
"Strong answer from @JoeBiden on earning the African-American vote in South Carolina and throughout the country." -- Kurt Bardella, Democratic media strategist and former Republican congressional spokesman
".@JoeBiden interrupting @amyklobuchar to take credit for writing a bill he did not write (closing the boyfriend loophole -- access to guns for domestic abusers) is not a good look." -- Kelly Dittmar, scholar at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics
"@JoeBiden had a strong night, which was a must. He'll win South Carolina on Saturday and change the trajectory of the race." -- John Weaver, co-founder of Project Lincoln and former strategist for John Kasich
"Best debate performance yet from @JoeBiden -- he's best when his back is against the wall." -- Jennifer Palmieri, former spokeswoman for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
Michael R. Bloomberg
Mr. Bloomberg had a disastrous showing in last week's debate, a point he used for a self-deprecating punchline that did not land at all.
This debate did not earn him great reviews, either -- especially, in an echo of last week, when it came to his exchanges with Elizabeth Warren and to any discussion of stop-and-frisk policing. But the bar was pretty low after his first performance, and some strategists said he at least cleared that.
"Bloomberg is trying to prove that his sexual harassment was nothing more than bad jokes by repeatedly telling bad jokes." -- Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver
"Bloomberg looks so agitated and uncomfortable when held accountable by Warren. His whole 'enough is never enough for her' line felt sexist and dismissive." -- Marc Lamont Hill, author and professor of media studies at Temple University
"Bloomberg actually in this debate. Not a natural but slugging away. Solid improvement." -- Mike Murphy, Republican strategist
"'With this senator, enough is never enough.' Is that the new 'nevertheless she persisted'? Bloomberg is bad at this." -- Shaunna Thomas, co-founder and executive director of UltraViolet
Pete Buttigieg
Mr. Buttigieg is heading into a tough stage of the race: If he wants to turn his strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire into something lasting, he will have to gain a lot of support very quickly from people of color.
Analysts generally thought he did well in the debate, but they were divided on how much it might help him.
"Smart of Pete to keep hammering away on down-ballot races." -- Jesse Lehrich, former foreign policy spokesman for Hillary Clinton
"'How can we deliver a revolution if you can't support a rule change?' Killer line from @PeteButtigieg to @BernieSanders." -- Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster
"Good debate for Buttigieg. I doubt his hits on Bernie will hurt Bernie, though." -- Laura Belin, Iowa Democratic commentator
"So the youngest guy on the stage has the most thoughtful and comprehensive answer on the threats we face. Imagine that." -- Jen Psaki, former spokeswoman for Mr. Obama
Amy Klobuchar
Ms. Klobuchar drew praise for bringing up the coronavirus epidemic, and for encouraging viewers to visit not her own website, but the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But in a debate in which candidates seemed to be screaming over one another more often than not, she did not seem to break through very much.
"Klobuchar's answer on coronavirus was very strong ... and driving viewers to the CDC site really drove home the seriousness of the situation." -- Mo Elleithee, executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service and former Democratic National Committee spokesman
"Amy Klobuchar's success at positioning herself as a pragmatic moderate is interesting. ... In low information environments, female candidates are perceived as more liberal than men, though Klobuchar's candidacy shows that voters respond to candidate messaging." -- Erin Cassese, political psychology expert at the University of Delaware
"All the blah blah blah from candidates who have next to no black support. @amyklobuchar keeps touring winning 'the middle' of the country and she means white voters like her Uncle Dick. She doesn't mean Philly, Detroit, Milwaukee." -- Aimee Allison, founder of She the People
Bernie Sanders
As is inevitable for a front-runner, Mr. Sanders fielded a lot of attacks on Tuesday, and his responses did not always land. More than once, the audience booed him, which seemed to surprise him and throw him off his stride.
Still, he parried other attacks well, and strategists noted that given his position in the race, he could weather a less-than-stellar performance.
"Bernie just got booed for the second time tonight. This is his worst #DemDebate so far -- he's not reading this audience. He's not listening." -- Frank Luntz
"Tonight just underscores how big a missed opportunity last week was for all the candidates who ganged up on Bloomberg and left Bernie alone. Bernie is on the defensive and struggling to turn it around. And the audience reaction is catching him off guard." -- Mo Elleithee
"Bernie is the most likely nominee. No one who needed a home run achieved it, though there were more effective attacks on Bernie since Bloomberg was ignored more." -- Matt Grossmann, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University
"At the end of the day @BernieSanders once again escapes relatively unscathed from a contentious debate while still enjoying the most speaking time." -- Anna Sampaio, professor of political science and ethnic studies at Santa Clara University
Tom Steyer
The commentariat didn't have much bad to say about Mr. Steyer. But the hard truth was that they didn't really have much to say about him at all.
"In the battle of the billionaires ... Tom Steyer is so much better on the debate stage than Mike Bloomberg is." -- Mo Elleithee
"Thank you @TomSteyer for speaking up about #CyberSecurity and protecting the integrity of our elections." -- Donna Brazile, former Democratic National Committee chairwoman
"Steyer had good moments but I didn't hear a compelling case for his candidacy." -- Laura Belin
Elizabeth Warren
Expectations were high for Ms. Warren going into Tuesday's debate, given both the high stakes (she is behind in the polls and in delegates) and her dominant performance at last week's debate.
She did not replicate that performance, and some strategists criticized her decision to once again focus on Mr. Bloomberg instead of the front-runner, Mr. Sanders. But she did have several strong moments, and commentators praised her ability to cut through the free-for-all onstage.
"The @ewarren 'strategy' befuddles me. This is about winning and not sure where she is trying to gather votes. A feather duster on Bernie, who is going in for the kill against her with rallies in Massachusetts." -- John Weaver
"So far Warren is the only candidate hasn't lost their cool and stayed focused." -- Karen Finney, Democratic consultant
"Warren is the only candidate who can fundamentally cut into Bernie's base & she understands exactly how to do it." -- Jesse Lehrich
"'This is a moment to choose hope over fear. This is our moment.' @ewarren gets in one of the few clear, calm and uninterrupted responses before the #DemDebate break." -- Kelly Dittmar

THE WORLD; U.S. ignored Assange's leak warning, lawyers say; WikiLeaks founder partnered with media groups to safely share cables, defense says.

Texto completo: Julian Assange frantically tried to warn the White House that thousands of unredacted classified diplomatic cables were about to be released on the internet, his lawyers told a London court Tuesday on the second day of the WikiLeaks founder's extradition hearing.
Instead of recklessly releasing the cables containing the names of secret sources, lawyers said, Assange and his colleagues at WikiLeaks tried to block them from becoming freely available to prevent lives from being put at risk.
"This is an emergency," Assange and his WikiLeaks colleague Sarah Harrison said when they called the U.S. secretary of State's emergency phone line, according to lawyer Mark Summers. "It's a matter of urgency. Real urgency."

Summers said that after failing to get through to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's staff, he tried to call the U.S. ambassador in Britain, citing a "very large emergency" and asking: "Can you escalate it?"
"I don't understand why you're not seeing the urgency of this. Unless we do something, then people's lives are put at risk," the WikiLeaks team told the operator, according to Assange's lawyers.
Assange, 48, is fighting extradition to the U.S., where he is facing 18 charges that he conspired with Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to release classified documents to the world.
Lawyers for Assange said the U.S. government's claims that Assange solicited information from Manning via a "most wanted leaks" list was an "absolute fantasy." They also disputed the U.S. government's charge that Assange helped Manning to hack into government databases.
"One could accurately describe this chapter of the case as lies, lies and more lies," Summers said.
Lawyers for the U.S. government hit back, saying those were "simply absurd" allegations "that should not lightly be made." They also rejected claims they were seeking to ratchet up the charges against Assange.
"We have a clear, unequivocal and legal basis for charging him, and that's the end of it," lawyer James Lewis said.
The indictment against Assange describes the leak as "the largest compromise of classified information in the history of the United States."
In an effort to paint Assange as an investigative journalist fighting for free speech and exposing war crimes, Assange's lawyers said the archive of documents has "altered the world we live in."
"It has altered the court of human rights litigation," Summers said. "It has caused oppressive governments to fall."
However, on Monday, lawyers representing the U.S. government said Assange could not hide behind the guise of a journalist and was guilty of "pure criminality" for the hack and recklessness for the release of sensitive cables without redacting the names of sources in Afghanistan and Iraq who were providing intelligence to the U.S. and its allies. Some of those sources subsequently "disappeared," the court heard.
Summers said these allegations were knowingly wrong and misleading.
"It's difficult to conceive of a clearer example of an extradition request that boldly and blatantly misstates the facts as they are known to be to the U.S. government," Summers said.
He said WikiLeaks did not rush to publish the cables once it obtained them in April 2010.
Instead, Assange partnered with news organizations including the Guardian, the New York Times and Der Spiegel to release the cables in an orderly, safe manner later that year. He also carefully worked with their journalists to ensure identities in the cables were protected, even involving people in the U.S. government who were "feeding redactions into the media partnership," Summers said.
But a Guardian journalist published a book in February 2011 titled: "WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy," which contained the 58-key password to unredacted copies of the cables, enabling them to become freely accessible by the public online, Assange's lawyers said.
"The gates got opened not by Mr. Assange or WikiLeaks but by another member of that [media] partnership," Summers said. "The notion that Mr. Assange deliberately put lives at risk by dumping an unredacted database of cables is knowingly inaccurate."
The Guardian denied the claim Tuesday.
"It's a complete invention that I had anything to do with Julian Assange's own publication decisions," said the paper's former investigations editor David Leigh, who co-wrote the book. "His cause is not helped by people making things up."
Assange sat calmly throughout the testimony, listening intently and speaking to his legal team during the breaks. The sound of his supporters chanting demands for his freedom outside the courtroom could sporadically be heard, and the judge offered to adjourn briefly if they became too disruptive.
But by midafternoon, Assange was visibly struggling to follow the court proceedings. He repeatedly closed his eyes, covered his mouth to stifle several yawns and appeared to be falling asleep at times. The judge stopped proceedings to check if he was able to continue, and a member of his legal team spoke to him.
"Mr. Assange is struggling," she said. "He's finding it hard to concentrate. He can't communicate with his legal team. He's finding it very difficult."
Before the day's testimony got underway, Assange's lawyer Edward Fitzgerald also sought help from Judge Vanessa Baraitser regarding his client's treatment in Belmarsh prison which, he said, risked his right to a fair trial. He said Assange was handcuffed 11 times and stripped naked twice, and his legal documents were taken from him after the first day's hearing. Assange was also put in five different cells during the day, the lawyer said.
"There is a risk that treatment of his nature will impinge on the proceedings ... his preparedness in being able to participate in these proceedings," Fitzgerald said.
The judge said that his lawyers would need to speak to prison authorities but that she expected his rights to be upheld.
"I think everyone in the court supports a fair hearing," she said.
Lawyers for the U.S. government said they supported this decision and "trenchant comments" should be made to the head of the prison.
If Assange is extradited to the U.S. and found guilty, he could face up to 175 years in prison.
Assange, an Australian citizen, is being held in Belmarsh prison after being removed from London's Ecuadorean Embassy last year. He had been living there since 2012 with political asylum but was forcibly removed and arrested in April by British police on bail violations when that diplomatic protection was withdrawn.
At the time Assange sought refuge at the embassy, he was facing sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which he consistently denied. The charges were eventually dropped.
The extradition hearing, which is expected to last the week, seeks to determine whether his extradition is legal under the terms of a U.S.-U.K. treaty. An additional hearing is set for May.

After Raids, a Fashion Mogul Says He Will Step Down

Texto completo: Under investigation for rape, and after his brand was dropped by a major distributor, the Canadian multimillionaire is leaving his company.
Federal agents and New York police officers on Tuesday raided the Manhattan headquarters of Peter Nygard, a Canadian fashion retailer, as part of an investigation into allegations of sexual assault, two officials said. The operation followed a raid on his Los Angeles home the night before.
The previously undisclosed investigation, by a joint child exploitation task force that included the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department, has been underway for at least five months. Investigators have interviewed at least four young women who claim that Mr. Nygard, a 78-year-old Canadian multimillionaire, raped them in the Bahamas as teenagers.
On Tuesday evening, a spokesman for Mr. Nygard said he would step down as chairman and divest ownership of his company, Nygard International, "recognizing the priority of the welfare of the thousands of Nygard employees, retail partners, loyal customers, vendors, suppliers and business partners."
The announcement came after a major client, Dillard's department stores, said it would no longer carry Mr. Nygard's fashion line.
The four women interviewed by the task force were also plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Mr. Nygard filed this month in New York. The suit, brought on behalf of 10 women, accuses him of sex trafficking and other misconduct.
On Sunday, The New York Times detailed how a long, ugly feud with his billionaire neighbor in the Bahamas had led to the lawsuit, and showed a pattern of complaints about Mr. Nygard stretching back 40 years.
[Read The Times's investigation of allegations against Mr. Nygard.]
Mr. Nygard is a Finnish-born multimillionaire who has traveled with an entourage of models and self-described "paid girlfriends." Since the 1980s, Mr. Nygard has spent much of his time in an ultrarich community in the Bahamas.
His private multinational company has catered to middle-class women, selling leggings and tunics at his own outlets and Dillard's department stores. On Tuesday, a Dillard's spokeswoman said the company had canceled existing orders and suspended future purchases because Mr. Nygard's alleged actions were "in direct opposition to our core values."
Earlier on Tuesday, a spokesman for Mr. Nygard, Ken Frydman, said the fashion executive welcomed the investigation and expected that his name would be cleared. Mr. Frydman accused Mr. Nygard's neighbor, the hedge fund founder Louis Bacon, of being behind the litigation and federal raids.
Mr. Nygard is now believed to be in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where he started his company and maintains an office.
Federal authorities raided Mr. Nygard's home in Marina del Rey on Monday evening. About a dozen investigators in F.B.I. and New York Police jackets worked Tuesday morning at Mr. Nygard's corporate headquarters near Times Square in Manhattan, even bringing in a crow bar and a sledgehammer. They spent time on the sixth floor of the building, which he illegally converted into a private apartment with a Jacuzzi, according to a citation from the city in 2013. The headquarters and adjacent flagship store are emblazoned with his name and feature a large picture of him, golden muscles flexing, long gray hair flowing.
Investigators, who spent about five hours in the building, carried out at least eight boxes of materials, including at least one computer hard drive.
It is not the first time Mr. Nygard has been investigated by the federal authorities: The F.B.I. briefly looked at Mr. Nygard in 2015 and 2017 over allegations of sex trafficking. The Department of Homeland Security also investigated Mr. Nygard for nine months starting in 2016. The inquiries sputtered out.
Mr. Nygard was estimated to be worth roughly $ 750 million in 2014 by Canadian Business magazine. An avowed playboy, he has fathered at least 10 children with eight women. In the Bahamas, he demanded a steady supply of sex partners, six former employees told The Times. The employees said they searched for young women at shops, clubs and restaurants to invite to parties and dinners.
Mr. Nygard called his Bahamian estate "the eighth wonder of the world": It featured sculptures of predators like lions and smoke-breathing snakes, a human aquarium where topless women undulated in mermaid tails, and a disco with a stripper pole.
Accusations against Mr. Nygard predated the current lawsuit. Nine women in Canada and California, mostly former employees, have sued Mr. Nygard or reported him to the authorities since 1980, alleging sexual harassment or assault, The Times found. Another nine former employees said in interviews that he had raped them, touched them inappropriately or proposed sex.
The Times also talked to the 10 women involved in the lawsuit, each listed as Jane Doe in court documents. Most say that Mr. Nygard raped them during "pamper parties," which Mr. Nygard held on many Sunday afternoons at his Bahamian estate, offering young female guests pedicures, massages, Jet Ski rides and endless alcohol.
