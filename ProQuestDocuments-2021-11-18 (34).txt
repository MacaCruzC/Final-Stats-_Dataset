Texto completo: Yet another alleged act of intolerance that the press tried to pin on the Trump administration has been revealed to be a hoax.
It is not an accident that newsrooms keep blowing it on this stuff.
A 12-year-old black student at Immanuel Christian School in Springfield, Virginia, admitted Monday that she lied when she claimed three white students had held her down and forcibly cut her dreadlocks. Amari Allen said she fabricated the entire story, much to the chagrin of a news media that made it a point last week to note that second lady Karen Pence is a part-time teacher at Immanuel.Tweet
Indeed, newsrooms were keen to let readers know that the school that reportedly suffered an act of racial bigotry has a connection to the Trump administration.
“3 boys at Christian school where Karen Pence teaches allegedly cut black girl's dreadlocks,” read an NBC News headline.
Newsweek reported, “SIXTH GRADERS HOLD DOWN CLASSMATE, CUT HER DREADLOCKS AT PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL WHERE KAREN PENCE TEACHES.”
“Three sixth-grade boys allegedly attacked a girl at a private Christian school. The alleged assailants called the young girl’s hair ‘ugly’ and ‘nappy’ while attacking her during recess at Immanuel Christian School — where Karen Pence currently teaches art,” tweeted the Daily Beast.
The New York Times was similarly careful in its reporting to note that, “Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, accepted a part-time art teaching position there in January.”
“This is the school where Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence teaches,” tweeted Washington Post reporter Eugene Scott. “More This school previously made headlines when Karen Pence was criticized for joining its staff despite the school’s position on not hiring LGBT employees.”
It is clear what these headlines and tweets sought to accomplish. By linking the alleged racist act to Pence, newsrooms sought to shame the vice president and his wife while suggesting also that acts of intolerance such as the one Allen “suffered” are a direct result of the Trump presidency.
Allen’s parents released a statement this week apologizing for their daughter's hoax.
“To those young boys and their parents, we sincerely apologize for the pain and anxiety these allegations have caused. To the administrators and families of Immanuel Christian School, we are sorry for the damage this incident has done to trust within the school family and the undue scorn it has brought to the school,” the statement reads.
It adds, “To the broader community, who rallied in such passionate support for our daughter, we apologize for betraying your trust. We understand there will be consequences, and we’re prepared to take responsibility for them. We know that it will take time to heal, and we hope and pray that the boys, their families, the school and the broader community will be able to forgive us in time.”
Here is a spoiler: The reporters who tried to slime Pence with Allen's allegation will not think about how they “can do better next time.” There will not be an end to this sort of sloppy and irresponsible reporting. The dirty not-so-secret is that a significant number of reporters see themselves more as being in the business of “resisting” the Trump White House than keeping the public informed.
There is a reason why this Allen episode feels so familiar. We have been down this road many, many times since Trump was inaugurated in 2017.
In February 2017, for example, newsrooms were eager to condemn the Trump White House after a Detroit man claimed his ailing mother died in Iraq because of the president’s executive order banning travel from several countries that are predominantly Muslim. It was all a lie. Later, in January 2018, newsrooms accused Vice President Mike Pence of segregating men and women at the Western Wall in Jerusalem. He was responsible for no such thing. Then there is the media's promotion of the Covington Catholic hoax. That one was particularly egregious.
This keeps happening. Newsrooms keep embracing dubious allegations of harmful, bigoted behavior because too many reporters are not operating as reporters. They are operating instead as political activists. They've already drawn their conclusions about the Trump White House. Their goal now is to find supporting evidence, and things such as Allen's since-recanted story are the perfect match.

Texto completo: Washington • As Speaker Nancy Pelosi solemnly declared the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump last week, and the steady stream of Democrats supporting it became something of a stampede, a small group of Democrats remained unconvinced.
The cluster of skeptics, mostly moderate first-term lawmakers in conservative-leaning districts, had dwindled to just a dozen by Friday, as lawmakers raced down the Capitol steps to catch flights and start two weeks of work in their districts. By then, many Democrats had joined the chorus of those backing an impeachment inquiry, worried about threats in primary elections and bowing to a rapidly shifting consensus in the caucus.
But for a few determined holdouts, there is not yet a reason to endorse the inquiry.
Instead, those willing to elaborate on their thinking have called for a “fact-finding investigation,” urging their colleagues to take a more methodical approach that could rise above the partisan fray. They took care to stress that they were concerned about the allegations the president faced about his dealings with Ukraine.
“Ensuring the strength of our democracy means we have to pursue the truth,” Rep. Kendra Horn, the only Democrat in the Oklahoma delegation, said in an interview. “And it means we do it in a bipartisan matter, in an honest and methodical manner.”
She later added, “I don’t make any judgment until I know all of the facts.”
Horn, like some of the other Democrats who have refrained from embracing the impeachment inquiry, faces a more challenging political reality than some of her other moderate colleagues: She is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House, fighting to keep her seat in a district that Trump swept in 2016, in an election year when both of their names will be on the same ballot.
The House Republican campaign arm delighted in the swift deluge of Democratic support last week for an impeachment inquiry, particularly among the more than 40 freshmen who seized Republican seats in 2018. They have embarked upon a politically tricky balancing act of their own, working to sell voters on the idea in swing districts.
But a smaller group of Democrats are not there yet. They said their reluctance to plunge into an impeachment inquiry stemmed from a desire to have a bipartisan process, as opposed to preserving their political futures.
“I’m going to do what’s best for our country,” Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., said. “It’s not going to be based on politics or getting reelected.
“Wherever the facts go, the law must follow,” he added. “Everybody should take it extremely seriously.”
For some reluctant Democrats, a primary challenge appeared to factor into their decision to back the inquiry.
Rep. Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, a leader of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, endorsed an impeachment investigation after his primary challenger criticized “#TimidTom” for not doing so earlier.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, the only one of 19 contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination not to back an impeachment inquiry, came out in support of it Friday. She had condemned it previously as divisive for the country.
Her announcement came less than 24 hours after Kai Kahele, the Hawaii state senator seeking Gabbard’s seat, voiced his astonishment on Twitter that “any responsible Member of Congress who has taken the time to read & process the Mueller Report, the Ukraine call memo and the whistleblower’s report can still be opposed to opening an impeachment inquiry.”
Rep. Anthony Brindisi, the freshman Democrat who won his New York district by fewer than 4,500 votes, said his office had received a sharp spike in calls on impeachment last week.
“I’ve heard a lot of folks who have called our office in support of impeachment,” he told reporters outside the Capitol on Friday. “I’ve had a pro-Trump, anti-impeachment rally outside of my district office, so we’re hearing a good mix of opinions from people.”
Some moderate Democrats said they were eager to use the two-week break in their districts to get feedback about the opening of an impeachment inquiry and to explain that the investigation would not immediately translate to a vote on the House floor that could result in the president’s removal.
“I’m eager to get home as quickly as possible to hear from people directly,” said Rep. Max Rose, the freshman Democrat who represents the New York City borough of Staten Island, adding that there needed to be an effort to earn voters’ trust about the fairness of the impeachment process.
“They have got to understand that this is not a partisan process,” he said.
And some of the members acknowledge that their endorsement, or lack thereof, is unlikely to deter the overall direction of the caucus toward filing articles of impeachment.
“That ship has sailed, and the inquiry is happening,” Brindisi said. “Whether I’m for it or against it, it’s happening.”

Ross Douthat: The last exit from Trumpland

Texto completo: Ask an intelligent Republican staffer what they imagine awaits their party after Donald Trump, and you’ll get an interesting disquisition on the factions and figures that might shape conservatism, the political and policy arguments to come.
Ask that same staffer what happens if Trump is reelected, and you’ll get a heavy sigh, a thousand-yard stare and then a hopeful “Well, maybe we can just pretend he isn’t there ...?”
This is the state of Republican politics with impeachment suddenly looming. People are ready for the after, the reckoning to come, the attempted restorations and Trumpisms-without-Trump, the great Nikki Haley-Tucker Carlson brawl.
But if Trump survives impeachment and somehow gets reelected, there will be no after Trump, not yet and not for four long years. Instead Trump will bestride his party like a decaying colossus, and his administration’s accelerative deterioration will be the GOP’s as well. There will be no second-term policymaking, no John Kelly to stabilize the ship — just a floating hulk drifting between the icebergs of recession and foreign crisis, with all American conservatism onboard.
Outside the ranks of the truest Trump believers, most Republicans anticipate very bad things in 2022 and 2024 if the Trump Show continues uninterrupted. And most would happily fast-forward through that show if the magical remote control from that terrible Adam Sandler movie were suddenly available.
My days of writing high-dudgeon columns demanding that Republicans act in concert against Trump are behind me; cynicism and bemusement define my attitude toward GOP decadence these days.
But in a bored-Roman-aristocrat drawl, I just want to suggest — mildly, dabbling my hands in a convenient finger bowl — that the current impeachment inquiry might, in fact, be that magical remote control: a chance to hit fast-forward and summon the post-Trump future into existence here and now, for the 2020 campaign.
Hitting the button requires only two things: the swift, before-primary-season impeachment schedule House Democrats are entertaining and then 20 Republican votes in the Senate for conviction, if the Trump-Giuliani operation in Ukraine looks as bad in a few months as it does today.
Of course the second thing is a political near-impossibility. But we’re fantasizing here, my dear Petronius, so we can imagine how it might happen. Start with Mitt Romney, add the four retiring Republican senators, plus the most embattled purple-state 2020 incumbents, plus a clutch of Republicans most at risk in 2022, plus the handful of the senators who don’t face the voters till 2024 ... and then you’re just a few Republicans of principle away from 20.
In voting to remove Trump (and to bar him, as an impeachment can, from simply running for president again immediately), these 20 would allow the other 33 Republican senators to stand by him, thank him for his service and promise to Make America Great Again themselves. And the more ambitious among the latter group of senators would then compete to succeed Trump, while his wrath was concentrated against the treacherous 20.
That competition would be the next phase of our fast-forward: With Trump gone, everyone from Haley and Carlson to Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley could jump into an accelerated primary campaign against the unloved Republican “incumbent,” Mike Pence. The result would be, in effect, the 2024 Republican primary four years early — with the possibility of either pre-empting a President Elizabeth Warren or preventing a Trump second term’s likely demolition of the party.
Of course this is just a pleasant conceit, whose mere description by a Trump critic like myself will irritate the many conservatives for whom it’s absurd to imagine any upside to allowing Democrats and the media to eject a fighting conservative president from office.
I think these conservatives underestimate, as liberals did with Bill Clinton long ago, the advantages in jettisoning a corrupt leader. (An Al Gore presidency was a better timeline for Democrats, even though it would have required the horror of letting Ken Starr win.) But I certainly can see ways in which, after so much elite failure and populist anger, having elites (indeed, the CIA!) work to remove a populist president just before his reelection campaign could make our toxic politics that much worse.
But I would still ask — swirling my wine and adjusting my NeverTrumper toga — worse than what? Worse than a world where Trump survives impeachment, the Ukraine miasma chokes Biden’s campaign, Warren proves less electable than her supporters hope, we replay 2016 with the Electoral College and enter a second Trump term with the ship of state rudderless, Democrats yet more radicalized, and all those icebergs looming for the country and the GOP alike?
In the event we do arrive in that world, consider this column a casually tossed marker for the Republican senators who will probably vote to keep Trump in office, in case they find themselves very unhappy with the ultimate result.
You can’t say that you didn’t have an early exit from the Trump era. You can’t say you didn’t have a choice.

Is Trump’s ‘war’ on California just for show?

Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Texto completo: Seeing through liberal hypocrisy I find the Daily Herald series on climate change extremely offensive.
Objective, and factual, individuals don’t fall into the trap of the liberal and popular mob.
Quoth the Herald: "One hopes that the current political leadership in the U.S. will eventually see the error of rolling back environmental protections … (but we) can’t afford to wait for a hoped-for change of heart."
Thank God for President Donald Trump, who sees through the Obama administration’s folly of eliminating fossil fuels for energy production. References to the United Nations’ studies, or anything else they say, are irrelevant in all respects as our president has repeatedly pointed out about these freeloaders.
I recommend your entire editorial board, along with The New York Times retire to Miami. In case you haven’t heard today, Miami will only be around two more years. Typical liberal hypocolypse.
As they say: "liberals aren’t happy unless they are miserable/ misery loves company."

Texto completo: The “deep state" is back — and you may be hearing that phrase more in the future as President Donald Trump scrambles to defend the actions exposed by a whistleblower that have sparked impeachment proceedings.
In the latest high-profile mention of the conspiracy theory, Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller said Sunday that the whistleblower was connected to the deep state.
"I know the difference between whistleblower and a deep state operative," Miller said. "This is a deep state operative, pure and simple."
Trump himself tweeted on Sept. 15 that he was “fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News, the Deep State, the Democrats, and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS, who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation), with the help of some truly great Republicans, and others."
He tweeted on Sept. 21 that the country was seeing economic success “despite a Crooked and Demented Deep State, and a probably illegal Democrat/Fake News Media Partnership the likes of which the world has never seen."
Raising the deep state theory was suggested in talking points that the White House accidentally e-mailed to Democrats. “This case just shows another example of the 'Deep State,' the media, and Democrats in Congress damaging our national security by leaking confidential information in an attempt to seek political gain," said the talking points, which were meant to guide Republicans in their defense of Trump in the burgeoning scandal.
Republican lawmakers and party officials, as well as conservative media have also been raising the deep state theory again in recent days.
The deep state theory, as defined by Merriam-Webster, envisions “an alleged secret network of especially nonelected government officials and sometimes private entities (as in the financial services and defense industries) operating extralegally to influence and enact government policy."
The theory goes back years among conservative websites such as Infowars and Breitbart. Trump courted right-wing conspiracy theorists on his way to the White House and installed Steve Bannon, chief executive of Breitbart, as his chief strategist once he took office, Newsweek reported in 2017. (Bannon has since left the White House). Trump has blamed a deep state conspiracy for trying to both block his election and thwart his agenda.
Paul Musgrave, an associate professor of political science who teaches foreign policy at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said the idea of the deep state was once applied to countries like Turkey and Egypt, where the military and national security apparatus played a big role in the actions of the civilian governments.
“It was part of the analytical toolkit that scholars and observers had developed" to understand such countries, he said.
The idea has, however, been “ported over to the United States in a very weird way," he said, with the controversial, divisive Trump using it to defend himself from allegations like the whistleblower's.
“It's a really useful bogeyman, but there's no evidence for it," he said.
“There are a lot of people who work for the federal government who probably did not vote for Donald Trump, but that's something every president faces. The mark of the American civil service is a willingness to work for whoever the president is, setting aside your political beliefs and links," Musgrave said.
“Conspiracy theories are endemic in American history. There's always a substantial number of folks who believe and traffic in these theories. What's different right now is we have a president who's pretty openly engaging with these. ... It is uncharted territory for the mass media era of American politics," Musgrave said.
Musgrave said he felt that the deep state theory was surfacing again after a lull. Google Trends indicated that interest in the term spiked in 2017 and 2018 but quieted down somewhat last fall.
Joseph Uscinski, an associate professor of political science at University of Miami who has co-authored the book “American Conspiracy Theories," said, “There is an entrenched part of government. There is a bureaucracy. They are unelected. ... Whether they are pulling the strings of government is a different issue. Whether there is a coordinated operation to take Trump out of office is another issue."
He said versions of the deep state theory have played out in the past in American history, noting the idea floated during the Red Scare that Communists controlled the goverment and theories that the military and the CIA killed President John F. Kennedy.
The deep state theory is “one of the core tenets of Trumpism," he said, noting that during the campaign Trump promised to “drain the swamp" of corruption in Washington.
Both professors said it wasn't clear to them whether Trump actually believes in the deep state or whether it is simply a tactic to gull his supporters. “It's really hard to speculate on what President Trump truly believes," Musgrave said. He noted recent reporting that suggests Trump, in his phone call with the Ukrainian president, appeared to be looking into some farfetched theories.
At the same time, he may “also be concocting a story to discredit these charges," Musgrave said.
Both experts agreed that, even though Trump is playing the deep state card yet again, he is likely to keep on doing what he is doing.
“I'm sure he will continue," Uscinski said. “This has been his MO, to call into question anyone who calls him into question."
Many of his supporters will “buy it because he says it," Uscinski said. “It will not wear off. They'll hold on to their pro-Trump deep state beliefs."
That could change if more evidence is brought forward, but it will take more than a whistleblower from the CIA to change minds, Uscinski said.
“He's been going back to this well for years," Musgrave said. “I'm not sure this is as much of an innovation and departure as we might think."
How long will he keep raising the deep state theory to fire up his supporters?
“Until it stops working," Musgrave said.

America faces 'Crisis of Conscience' Author Mueller, who has Spokane ties, examines whistleblowers in new book

Texto completo: Sometimes things are just meant to be.
Like when you work for seven years researching and writing a book that takes a massive deep dive into the complicated and often misunderstood world of whistleblowers only to have one of the largest and most important whistleblower cases in our country's history begin at almost exactly the same time your book is to be released. That's exactly what happened to Tom Mueller.
His new book - "Crisis of Conscience: Whistleblowing in an Age of Fraud" - will be available in bookstores across the world on Tuesday and absolutely at Auntie's Bookstore in downtown Spokane. It's almost as if the book-loving literary gods wanted to give Mueller a little help by having Congress open an impeachment inquiry based upon a whistleblower just days before his book would go on sale.
In an email interview and phone call with The Spokesman-Review, the New York Times best-selling author offered another explanation. He jokingly suggested that maybe there's something to 1930s Yankees pitcher Lefty Gomez's belief that it's better to be lucky than good.
Dumb luck?
Hardly. Especially the dumb part.
Mueller has long been able to tie things together in intelligent and relevant ways for seemingly obscure subjects that become investigative page-turners once they have piqued his interest. That's what happened with his first book - the 2011 New York Times bestseller, "Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil."
People were initially dismissive of a book about bad olive oil as nothing more than a first-world problem not needing much of a solution, but Mueller's tale was filled with so much history and so many fascinating stories that it began to sink in that olive oil fraud was "paradigmatic of identical problems throughout our food chain," Mueller said last week. Only it was all done in a way that made a liquid fat that's often been associated with purity seem like something with closer ties to Tony Soprano than to religious rituals and tasty food.
Because none of us fully understood all of the corruption, deceit and profit behind olive oil.
It's that sort of connective and thoroughly researched storytelling that makes "Crisis of Conscience" such an interesting read as well - regardless of which side you're betting on in our nation's latest and greatest presidential drama.
"I've become convinced that whistleblowers are a very important litmus test, or rather canary in a coal mine, for the health of our democracy," Mueller said. "The more extreme the corruption in the public and private sphere, the more whistleblowers will come forward - because after all, no matter how widespread corruption, we all retain some form of individual conscience, a sense of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable to human behavior."
It's all of that bad human behavior that's brought to light by some very unlikely people that makes his latest book so darn good. There's a moment when you go from being intimidated by its nearly 600 pages to being a bit sad that it's going to end. Each turn of the page is so rewarding on so many different levels.
Speaking of meant to be, it's also a bit of fortuitous fate that one of Mueller's first national book tour appearances for "Crisis of Conscience" is happening in Spokane. Mueller is one of our upcoming featured authors for The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages book club. He will be our speaker on Monday, Oct. 28, at the Montvale Events Center. Tickets are on sale now and we expect the event to sell out quickly.
So why is a guy who has had a national best-seller, written for the New Yorker, National Geographic and the New York Times - all while living or working in 48 countries, and currently in Italy - and whose book is so perfectly timed for this exact moment in our country's history that the Washington Post rushed a review of it late last week, starting his speaking tour in Spokane?
Because Spokane is his hometown. Kinda.
He's come to Spokane and its surrounding lakes every summer since he was born. His grandparents had a cabin on Spirit Lake where they'd congregate each year for informal family reunions. The family still has that cabin and still meets there.
"Though I spend a lot of time abroad and on the road, my official residence is Spokane," he said. "My mother and brother live on the South Hill, and I stay with them every chance I get.
"I've seen the city evolve remarkably over the decades: the growth from Geiger Field to Spokane International Airport, the Expo grounds (where a distant relative of mine was the chief engineer) and Spokane Valley filling with buildings clear to the Idaho line. I feel more at home in Spokane than anywhere else in the U.S."
Which is why he had to start his book tour here. Well, that and we asked nicely.
And we did it long before there was even a whiff of new a whistleblower in Washington, D.C. - which means Mueller is likely to start racking up some very big airline miles here pretty quickly as organizations and universities around the country reach out to him to explain what all of this might mean.
Not surprisingly, it's complicated. A really good story. Just complicated.
It even goes back to the beginning of our nation. Actually, even before the beginning of our nation.
"Crisis of Conscience" makes the case that our Founding Fathers were the original whistleblowers, both in actions and in words. As you make it further and further into the book, you realize that Mueller uses whistleblowing to explore what democracy and citizenship really mean.
"I freely admit that I didn't start out to do this or to write the book I eventually did," Mueller said last week. "It seemed - like all good emergent phenomena do - to arise of its own from the disparate subject matter and life stories I was working with.
"In a time where the actions of so many make conscience seem dead, even ridiculous, to have people remind us that they were willing to make the ultimate personal sacrifice in the service of real truth, justice and the collective good of our nation. The ultimate message - that humankind has great good as well as evil, and the capacity for remarkably principled behavior - is powerful."
In many ways, "Crisis of Conscience" became Mueller's attempt to understand - to dig up the root causes of - how America became a very different nation from the one he grew up in. That's not saying that there weren't serious problems before and that there aren't incredible strengths now. It is saying that it's very different now.
Still, there's a sense of questing throughout the book - and not just because he did hundreds and hundreds of interviews - that he's trying to find out how the United States got to this exact place and at this exact moment. This explains the wide-ranging nature of his attempts to understand the whistleblower psyche ... to get into the minds and the civic sense of those few who remain, in some sense, old-fashioned Americans.
At least Americans as initially defined by our Founding Fathers.
Then again by Abraham Lincoln.
And even by a current, and somewhat surprising, politician: the seven-term Republican senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. The guy who also served three terms in the U.S. House before running for the Senate. And that was after eight terms in the Iowa statehouse. The guy who has the current record for the longest streak of not missing a vote in the United States Senate.
You know, the guy who is currently president pro tempore of the Senate, making him third in line in the presidential line of succession.
Yep, as outlined again and again in "Crisis of Conscience," the conservative's conservative has been one of whistleblowers' biggest allies and proponents on Capitol Hill. He's gone out of his way to say whistleblowers are some of this nation's biggest patriots and then made sure they had protected status within our federal government for all they do to look out for the best interests of Americans.
Grassley is personally responsible for many of this nation's most important laws pertaining to whistleblowers. Yet he has been largely quiet during this current White House whistleblower case.
"Grassley has always been the most stalwart supporter of whistleblowers in Congress," Mueller said. "But his stalwart support for President Trump is a mystery to me - a likely indication of just how extremely polarized our politics has become."
Though it also could be a matter of practicality, a calculation Grassley has made so he can continue to best serve the desires of his Iowa constituency. And that's easier when you're in the same party as the person in the White House, even when you don't always agree. Still, as Mueller points out, it sure appears the principled politician from the Midwest is "supporting a man whose basic ethical framework couldn't be more different from his own, and doing so purely for political expediency."
And that appears to have even bled over over into the president's very vocal stance on the current whistleblower making waves in Washington.
"When Trump suggests this person is a spy and should be dealt with as spies were once dealt with - which means death - so far as I am aware there has been nothing but dead silence from Sen. Grassley," Mueller said. "I think, frankly, this is disgraceful, and wish I could imagine a more honorable explanation of his silence, and all the harm it does to the whistleblower rights, as well as to the image Grassley has worked so hard over decades to build, than naked political calculation."
You see, it's complicated.
Which is why it's so great we'll all get to talk with Mueller a little later this fall when he visits our newspaper's book club. Besides, he's a hometown guy.
Almost like it was meant to be.

When Mom comes to your job interview

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to sign, and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid, so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of the American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood, such as marriage and homeownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute.
Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time, and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents with whom Goldsmith works as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard; there's no class for that. We often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said.
Both hit adulthood without a tool kit for dealing with adversity and feel as if they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities ... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, Onyschak said.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently? Do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity, and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."

When Trump's Envoy for Ukraine Resigned, a College Journalist Beat Outlets to the Scoop

Texto completo: An editor at Arizona State University's student newspaper beat everyone else to the news that Kurt Volker had stepped down.
Kurt D. Volker has traveled halfway around the world as a United States diplomat. He has met with world leaders, negotiated foreign policy and served under multiple American presidents.
But when he abruptly resigned from his job as the State Department's special envoy for Ukraine, it wasn't an international broadcaster or national newspaper that had the scoop.
It was a 20-year-old junior at Arizona State University who broke the news in the school's student newspaper.
Mr. Volker serves as executive director of the McCain Institute, a think tank in Washington that is run by Arizona State University. When reporters at the student newspaper, The State Press, discovered the connection, they began looking into Mr. Volker and, on Friday evening, confirmed with an unnamed school official that the ambassador had resigned.
Andrew Howard, a managing editor of The State Press, said he hadn't set out to write a story that would be followed by reporters from dozens of major media outlets, including The New York Times. He had just been doing his job: covering the university.
"I didn't take a different approach to this story than any other," Mr. Howard said shortly after waking up to a flood of congratulatory texts on Saturday morning. "Everyone's looking for an 'aha' moment that I don't think was there."
Mr. Volker resigned after news reports surfaced that Mr. Trump had encouraged Ukraine's president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic candidate for president, which touched off a House impeachment inquiry. According to a whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump's efforts, Mr. Volker had advised Ukrainian officials on how to "navigate" the president's demands.
"We decided to take an approach to the story that a national outlet might not, and reach out to the university," Mr. Howard said. "I'm not sure we ever expected to get the scoop that we did."
When his story went online just after 6:15 p.m., Mr. Howard happened to be sitting in another newsroom: that of The Arizona Republic, where he is an intern and was working on obituaries. He apologized to his editors there for working two jobs at once.
The story immediately took off. The A.S.U. newspaper has been online only since the fall of 2014, and a popular story can garner a few thousand views on the website. Mr. Howard's cracked 100,000.
Mr. Howard grew up in Phoenix and was drawn to journalism in part because of his mother, who studied it in college. He was further inspired when he joined his high school newspaper, The Brophy Roundup, and met a teacher who advised the paper and encouraged its journalists to never shy away from serious stories, like coverage of the soccer team's hazing.
Since he arrived at A.S.U., the student newspaper has been a central focus.
"What do I do outside of it? I feel like I spend a lot of time at The State Press," Mr. Howard said.
International diplomacy is not a frequent subject of coverage for The State Press, which has a staff of about 100 editors and reporters who work from a basement office filled with "fairy lights, the occasional cockroach and lots of love," according to Kimberly Rapanut, the current editor in chief.
The newspaper's online pages are filled with a mix of everyday news -- profiles of clubs, sports coverage and crime -- and investigative pieces, including one story exposing a campus group's use of a Nazi-inspired flag. (The university later began investigating the group, College Republicans United.)
Jason Manning, the director of student media and an adviser to the newspaper, said he was incredibly proud of the student journalists for their scoop.
"The original reporting is one thing, but managing the ongoing viral explosion of this story adds another level of complexity and pressure, and they have handled themselves with an extraordinary degree of professionalism," Mr. Manning said.
He said he and other advisers and professors tell students that even on a college campus, they can break new developments in the day's biggest stories.
"Anything they do can immediately become a national or international story," Mr. Manning said. "That was the case this time, and they've handled it very well."

Texto completo: Feder: On eve of cancellation, ‘Worldview’ host wins Studs Terkel Award Just days before ending his 25-year run as host of "Worldview" on Chicago Public Media WBEZ 91.5-FM, Jerome McDonnell has been named recipient of a 2019 Studs Terkel Community Media Award. His Monday-through-Friday noon talk show on international affairs was canceled to make room for a new local talk show to air from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., starting October 14. McDonnell’s last broadcast will be October 4. He’s expected to shift to reporting on energy and environmental issues for the public radio station.
Deborah Douglas This year’s other Studs Terkel Award winners are Deborah Douglas, managing editor of MLK 50: Justice Through Journalism; Annie Sweeney, criminal justice reporter for the Chicago Tribune; and Britt Julious, freelance writer and editor. Now in their 25th year, the prestigious awards are presented by Public Narrative, the nonprofit community media organization. They’re named for the late Chicago author and broadcaster. The group also will cite Jeff McCarter, founder and executive director of Free Spirit Media, with its Uplifting Voices Award, and Nikole Hannah-Jones, lead reporter of The New York Times’ The 1619 Project, with its first Ripple Effect Award. All six will be honored October 17 at Zhou B. Art Center, 1029 West 35th Street. (Here is the link for tickets.) Paul Deanno A fifth meteorologist is about to join the weather front at NBC-owned WMAQ-Channel 5. Paul Deanno, chief meteorologist at CBS-owned KPIX in San Francisco, will sign on October 21 at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays. The Syracuse University graduate previously worked at KOMO, the ABC affiliate in Seattle, and WTVJ, the NBC-owned station in Miami. At NBC 5 he’ll work with Brant Miller, Andy Avalos, Alicia Roman and Kalee Dionne. Roman and Dionne will be helping Avalos with morning weather "as well as continuing to handle weekend weather and creating additional weather content for our digital platforms," according to Frank Whittaker, station manager and vice president of news.
Tracy Butler Tracy Butler, morning meteorologist at ABC-owned WLS-Channel 7, disclosed this week that she recently underwent treatment for breast cancer. She delivered an emotional public service announcement about early detection. "I’m good. I’m really doing so very well," she said. "The strength and support of my family and my very close friends has been instrumental in such a positive outcome. But my message is one of motivation to everyone to pay attention to you. Give yourself a gift and take care of you." Colleagues and viewers have rallied to her side. Butler, who grew up in Pittsburgh, joined ABC 7 in 1994 from ABC affiliate WRIC in Richmond, Virginia.
Fox 32 Here we go again: This time it’s all Fox-owned stations (including WFLD-Channel 32) dropped from Dish Network and Sling TV in the latest retransmission dispute. Both sides blame each other for the blackout, which began Thursday. Dish says Fox is "demanding a double-digit percentage rate increase for continued carriage of its local channels" and "attempting to ‘force bundle’ its local channels and unrelated cable networks to get more money and gain negotiating leverage." Fox says Dish is "choosing to drop leading programming as a negotiating tactic regardless of the impact on its own customers ... in an effort to coerce us to agree to outrageous demands."
Comment of the day Lawrence Peter Yolles: Bravo to you, Jerome [McDonnell] for your great service to all the listeners these many years. "Worldview" was a unique show and part of BEZ’s programming, and one of the best on WBEZ. Its proposed replacement, as it has been described and explained, does not give one much hope or trust that it will be something original or indispensable enough to be worth the loss.

Polly's People: Fresh Air Home a door to the beach for underprivileged children

Texto completo: "Going to the Fresh Air Home in the summer was a way of getting away from the chores and daily routine of living (at the Savannah Home for Girls)," recalled Melinda.
Added Linda: "The Fresh Air Home was a very important part of our lives. It was a chance to get away during the summer to learn crafts and sing songs."
In the beginning, as well as today more than 100 years after it opened, The Fresh Air Home's mission has remained the same - "to increase the health and happiness of underprivileged children."
The home was founded in 1897 by Nina Anderson Pape and operated by The Froebel Circle, which still oversees the facility. Thanks to the generosity of several individuals who donated money and property through the years, the Fresh Air
Home manages to serve 380 children each summer in four two-week sessions.
Traditionally, the home has maintained a low profile and never has held an annual fund-raising campaign, explained Susan Arden-Joly, president of The Froebel Circle. But this year the Froebel Circle has planned an upcoming event called the "Sunset Soiree," with all proceeds going to repair the aging and collapsing wooden boardwalk that gives the children direct access to the beach.
The soiree - from 4 to 9 p.m. Oct. 26 - will include food, drinks entertainment and a silent auction. Hosting the event will be New York Times best-selling author Mary Kay Andrews who will be selling and signing her books. Guests will tour the Fresh Air Home from 4 to 5:30 p.m., and have cocktails and a buffet prepared by chef Kirk Blaine from 6 to 9 p.m. at The Grandview at Hotel Tybee. Music will be provided by Samba Savannah and George Evans.
Free parking will be offered at the 14th Street parking lot with complimentary shuttle service to the Fresh Air Home. Tickets are $75 and can be purchased online by googling sunset soiree Tybee Island or with cash or check at Seaside Sisters, 1207 Hwy. 80, Tybee Island.
It isn't unusual for The Fresh Air Home to receive letters from former campers or in-person visits from those who remember time spent at the beachfront facility.
All these years later, Linda Lefferts' happy memories are still fresh and vivid.
"I remember a great big oak tree on the playground," she recalled. "I was always tall and long-legged and could scamper up that tree with very little effort. The limbs were low lying and massive."
She loved making crafts, especially ones with crepe paper and popsicle sticks. She also remembers lunch.
"Our lunch was always so good," she said. "After playing in the fresh air all day, swimming or playing in the sand, we enjoyed our lunch. Mrs. Detweiler, who ran the Henry Street School lunchroom, also worked at The Fresh Air Home. She remembered us from Henry Street and I remember how she was to see us again. It was nice to have someone from our pre-children's home time to recognize us."
Melinda Underwood Bouchillon recalled the pavilion near the beach where they listened to music, danced and played games.
Spending time at The Fresh Air Home meant "a little freedom we could get that we could not get at the home," she recalled. "Every morning and afternoon we would spend a few hours on the beach. (The counselors) used to rope off a big square on the beach and in the water to make sure we didn't wander. We stayed in bathing suits and shorts most of the time, which was great."
Being at The Fresh Air Home and the beach was "very special" for Melinda. "Even today, I have a condo on Orange Beach in Alabama because being close to the water reminds me of home and Savannah," she said.

FBI reportedly investigating NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: FBI agents in Philadelphia are investigating New Jersey's tax-break policies, which are also the center of a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy formed earlier this year, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.
The Inquirer cited multiple anonymous sources but reported that interviews of witnesses started a month ago and focused on development in Camden.
The revelations of federal agents investigating the tax breaks, which were used heavily under former former Gov. Chris Christie, also follow a steady stream of news reports raising questions about how the programs were administered and how companies took advantage of them.
The New York Times reported earlier in the week that a dozen companies had threatened to leave New Jersey for the same building complex in New York if they did not receive tax breaks. But they never did, and many of them never seriously considered moving to the Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, New York, located just a half-mile from the New Jersey border in Bergen County.
New Jersey's two major tax credit programs were designed to encourage businesses to create jobs and to invest in the Garden State, and Christie, a Republican, and many Democrats who supported the incentives have defended them as essential tools to compete with neighboring states.
The programs expired in July, but were already at the center of scrutiny before Philadelphia authorities reportedly joined the fray. The Attorney General's office in New Jersey has also been looking into the incentives, and the state comptroller issued a damning audit of the incentives at the beginning of the year, saying that they lacked proper controls and there was no way for the state to check if jobs were created.
Murphy's task force, led by a small team of white-collar attorneys, found in an initial report that special interests were overly influential on the creation and implementation of the credits, and that the agency doling out the awards didn't have the proper procedures in place to confirm the validity of applications worth millions of dollars in forfeited taxes.
The task force's biggest targets so far have been companies connected to George E. Norcross III, the heavily influential Democrat from South Jersey who worked closely with longtime friend Stephen Sweeney, the Democratic Senate president, and Christie on a range of policies over the years. Of nearly $11 billion in awarded tax breaks, about $1.1 billion in incentives went to those companies, all located in Camden.
One of the organizations connected to Norcross, Cooper University Hospital, has hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell, according to Politico New Jersey. The hiring of Lowell, who represented U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez in his corruption trial and White House adviser Jared Kushner in the special counsel's investigation of the Donald Trump presidential campaign, could be a sign that Cooper is facing a serious legal challenge.
For his part, Christie, a former federal prosecutor, said he is "not concerned" about the investigations and that they could be a reaction to media coverage and "the circus that's been created at the State House."
At the unveiling of his new political institute at Seton Hall University on Thursday night, he referred to a 2016 investigation of Norcross by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey that concluded "no further action is warranted."
Christie, whose institute is founded on civility in politics, blasted his Democratic successor, Murphy, for putting such heavy focus on the tax incentives.
"It's political theater by a guy who understands theater and who needs a show to distract from the fact that the major things that he ran on, he simply hasn't accomplished even though he has a Legislature of his own party," Christie said.
As much as $500 million in tax incentives were subject to being suspended by the state or have been voluntarily terminated already, the task force said in its 75-page report, issued in June. But that money has since been released, according to NJ Advance Media.

Morehouse confidence prepared Wilson for Harvard

Texto completo: Headnote OVERCOMING STRESS
ATLANTA - Morehouse graduate and former president John Silvanus Wilson says Morehouse inoculated him against doubts about his ability to compete anywhere, including Harvard, where he went on to earn two master's degrees and a doctorate.
"At Morehouse, they held a crown over my head and expected me, challenged me, to grow tall enough to wear it. When I came to Harvard, they held a question mark over my head. I felt the institution was causing me to ask do I belong here," he said.
Wilson says the confidence he gained at Morehouse enabled him to ignore the mixed messages he heard at Harvard, where today he is a senior advisor and strategist to the president.
A panelist last week at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health on mental health and wellness for students of color, Wilson joined other experts addressing how colleges must examine longstanding practices and campus cultures that convey to minority students they aren't valued or accepted.
Those messages can be overt, such as the noose found earlier this month in a University of Illinois residence hall, or they can be smaller acts, known as microaggressions, such as telling Black classmates after a presentation, "You're so articulate" or asking them to be the voice of an entire race - "What do Black people think of Joe Biden?"
College can be stressful for all students, but students of color face unique pressures in repeated exposure to racism, discrimination, microaggressions and questions about belonging on campus, said Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, founding director of the College Mental Health Program at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.
A Harris Poll of 1,000 college students with equal samples of African American, Latinx, white and Asian American students found that students of color are significantly less likely than white students to describe their campus as inclusive - 28% to 45%. Students of color are also more likely to report they often feel isolated on campus, 46% to 30%.
There has been troubling news about the mental health of African American children. While suicide rates in the United States have traditionally been higher among whites than Blacks across all age groups, a 2018 study published in JAMA Pediatrics found suicide rates for Black children aged 5-12 were roughly two times higher than those of similarly aged white children.
"What does it mean to be African American in this society that we have seen a doubling of the suicide rate among children aged 5 to 12 over a 20-year window?" said David Williams, chair of the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
A survey two years ago asked college students of color about their top concerns.
"The biggest concern of these students was aggressive policing - am I even going to make it home tonight? A second big concern was high levels of community violence and the third one was about financial stress, their ability to make it and the stability of their housing," said Williams. Such feelings of uncertainty, fear and hopelessness "are the recipe for mental health challenges, for being overwhelmed by stress," he said.
"Mental health concerns are like off the charts," Wilson said. "If we recognize that, if they're off the charts in general, and students of color are less likely to be aware of the services, less likely to be diagnosed and less likely to be treated, that really brings into focus the institutional responsibility. We cannot presume that the mental health services set up for one audience are suitable for all audiences. If I don't believe you want me here, I'm not inclined to come in and get your services."
Wilson said students of color bypass university services for the same reason they peer into the barbershop at the student center and keep walking. "If all the barbers look like Donald Trump, for instance, people are not going to guess you know something about me. It is the institution's responsibility to lower the barriers."
Often, students of color seek out each other to carve out safe places where they can be honest and be heard. Acknowledging the "sub family" he relied on while at Harvard grad school, Wilson said those informal support networks don't absolve universities of fostering a welcoming environment campus-wide. "We want the whole campus to be a safe space, the whole community to be a safe space."

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris wrote an op-ed in which she demanded the House Judiciary Committee open an impeachment hearing against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the one-year anniversary of Christine Blasey Ford's testimony against him.
"We need to get to the truth about Kavanaugh. And I believe the best path to truth and accountability is through a formal impeachment process," the California Democrat said in a Friday article in Elle. "That’s why I called on the House Judiciary Committee to open an impeachment inquiry and take a serious look at whether Kavanaugh lied under oath during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee."
Harris, 54, had sent a letter last week to Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, asking him to "investigate recent reports" of alleged misconduct by Kavanaugh.
The presidential candidate acknowledged the impeachment of Kavanaugh would likely "go nowhere" in the Senate, but she argued that it would help to restore "faith in our justice system" and provide "meaningful accountability and transparency."
Kavanaugh, 54, came under attack from Democrats this month after two New York Times reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, released an excerpt from their new book on Kavanaugh in which they mentioned a new allegation of sexual misconduct.
The authors received a torrent of criticism after the original piece failed to disclose that the alleged victim did not "recall the incident" and the witness, who had refused to talk to the paper, had faced off against Kavanaugh when he was a member of former President Bill Clinton's legal team while Kavanaugh was on Ken Starr's legal team.

Texto completo: Twelve presidential candidates are expected to debate on one stage during the October Democratic presidential primary debate, the largest number of debating candidates so far in the primary season.
The Democratic National Committee told campaigns in an email Friday morning that it intends to hold one debate night on Oct. 15, multiple outlets reported. The DNC had said that Oct. 16 could be a potential second night.
"To address several inquiries we have received we are writing to let you know that, pending a final decision after the certification deadline, it is the intention of the DNC and our media partners to hold the October debate over one night on Tuesday October 15th," the email said.
The desire for good ratings is a motivating factor behind the decision. "Our goal has always been to expand viewership, and we also believe that one night worked well for this last debate," an unnamed DNC official told CNN.
In the last three debate rounds, Democratic debates have not featured more than 10 candidates on a single debate stage. The June and July debates featured two nights with 10 candidates each, and the September debate had 10 candidates on a single night.
Only 10 candidates qualified for the September debate, all of whom will be in the October round. Because the October debate has the same qualification standards as the September round and gave candidates more time to amass qualifying polls, two additional candidates made the cut: billionaire businessman Tom Steyer and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Candidates must have reached 130,000 individual donors and 2% or higher support in at least four DNC-approved primary polls by Oct. 1 to qualify for the debate. Spiritual author Marianne Williamson is the only other not-yet-qualified candidate who has passed the donor threshold, but she is still three polls away from qualifying.
The 12 candidates who have qualified for the October debate stage in Ohio, hosted by CNN and the New York Times, are:

The DNC raised qualification standards for the November round, which could again winnow the field.

Texto completo: Review
'Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins'
1/2
Credits: Directed by Janice Engel
Running time/rating: 1:33, not rated, contains lots of salty language
The documentary "Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins" starts with several colorful, barbed comments delivered by the late political commentator and newspaper columnist, one of which is in answer to a question from talk show host David Letterman.
Letterman once asked Ivins what she thought of former Vice President Dan Quayle. After recalling that she had traveled with Quayle during his 1988 campaign (where she says she found him "dumber than advertised"), Ivins quips that, "I honestly think if you put that man's brain in a bumblebee, it would fly backwards."
The putdown might not be her funniest, sharpest or most countrified zinger in the film - which includes plenty more like that - but it's emblematic of the way this outspoken champion of civil liberties and common sense put things in plain-spoken perspective.
"Raise Hell" takes a thorough, if traditional, look at the Texas-born, Smith College-educated writer's life and career - a career that included stints at the New York Times and the Dallas Times Herald - and it includes interviews with her siblings, colleagues, friends and such media celebrities as Dan Rather and Rachel Maddow.
But it is when Ivins herself opens her mouth that the film is at its best. Whenever the movie presents archival clips from old interviews and lectures - or, as read by an actress, diary entries and letters - Ivins, who died in 2007 from breast cancer, comes alive.
When she herself is on the screen, Ivins makes for the best company for whom you could wish, and it's easy to understand how the politicians she covered, on both sides of the aisle, liked to spend time with her.
Of course, those times were often spent drinking, and "Raise Hell" doesn't shy away from talking about Ivins' well-known alcoholism, or her belief that there is no such thing as objectivity in journalism as long as you let the reader know where you stand.
Other topics covered include accusations of censorship of the often-controversial writer - a progressive in Texas, among the reddest of red states.
When she worked as a syndicated columnist, for instance, some of the film's interview subjects recall that newspapers would buy her column, preventing competing papers in the same market from doing so, only to withhold it from publication.
It's not difficult to see why we might need to be reminded of a voice like Ivins' again. With free speech under attack, and truth-telling seemingly in short supply, "Raise Hell" offers an entertaining and bracing look at one of journalism's least punch-pulling practitioners.

Texto completo: We have made it through a historic several days that will no doubt shape the next several weeks and months of American politics. We're going to take a bit of a different format this week to make sure you got a clear breakdown of what's happened in the past seven days.
First . . . what is going on?
President Donald Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry. The announcement by Speaker of House Nancy Pelosi came Tuesday after a summary of a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from July was released. That summary confirms previous reporting that Trump asked Zelensky to look into former Vice President Joe Biden's relationship with Ukraine, which would include the time his son Hunter Biden served on the board of directors of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Group.
So, a basic question is: Did the president of the United States ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival to help his own re-election effort?
What's the deal with Burisma?
Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani have repeatedly asserted that Biden in 2016 pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general to try to halt the investigation of Burisma. No evidence has emerged to support that claim. In fact, the concerns that Biden and other Obama administration officials expressed at the time were that the prosecutor wasn't doing enough to root out corruption. European allies shared those concerns. The prosecutor general was eventually voted out by Ukraine's parliament.
How did we get here? This seems like it happened really fast.
Last week, news reports began percolating about a whistleblower complaint in the U. S. intelligence community involving Trump's interactions with a foreign leader. Whistleblower complaints are required by law to be released to Congress, but the administration refused for weeks to hand it over. Over several days, it became known that the whistleblower complaint revolved around Trump's July call with Zelensky. Eventually, that led to the summary of their call being released, and then the impeachment inquiry. That all happened in the span of about 5 days.
So what was the testimony on Thursday about?
On Wednesday evening, the whistleblower complaint was released to some members of Congress. Democrats called it "deeply disturbing" and "credible. " By Thursday morning, the whistleblower complaint was declassified and released for the general public to read. Hours later, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence committee saying he believed the whistleblower did the right thing and that "everything involved in this matter is totally unprecedented. " Meanwhile, Trump in a closed-door meeting likened the whistleblower to a "spy" and used the word "treason" while discussing the complaint, according to the New York Times.
Where do we go from here?
It's not clear yet. The U. S. House has only twice in its history impeached a president, and a sitting president has never been removed from office. (Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. ) Pelosi told reporters Thursday that the impeachment inquiry will move forward under the House intelligence committee, but gave no deadline and said no conclusions have been made about what might be included in any articles of impeachment.
We'll be back next week with updates on this story, and keep checking usatoday. com/politics for the latest news. As always, thanks for reading. — Annah Aschbrenner

'Almost a spy': Donald Trump suggests whistleblower source committed treason as Ukraine firestorm builds

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump lashed out angrily on Thursday at whoever provided a whistleblower with details of his phone call with the president of Ukraine, calling the source of the leak “almost a spy” and suggesting the culprit had committed treason.
“You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?” Trump said, according to published reports. “We used to handle it a little differently than we do now. ”
Trump’s remarks, made at a private event in New York, came as the whistleblower’s complaint was made public and was the subject of a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. The complaint has prompted House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
The whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, revealed deep concern that Trump “used the power of his office” to solicit Ukraine’s help to discredit one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.
The complaint went on to detail efforts by senior White House officials to later "lock down" access to all records of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
More: Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway?
In New York, Trump reportedly told staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations on Thursday that he wants to know who leaked the information.
“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said.
The Los Angeles Times, which reported Trump’s remarks, said it had obtained a recording of Trump’s comments from a person attending the event. The New York Times also published an account of Trump’s remarks.
Bruce Udolf, a former federal prosecutor who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation involving President Bill Clinton, said Trump’s remarks could expose him to potential obstruction of justice or witness tampering charges.
“It’s not clear to me if Trump is more stupid than he is arrogant,” Udolf said, adding that a summary the White House released of the president's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart also demonstrated that Trump “hasn’t been terribly loyal to his country, either. ”
On Capitol Hill, congressional Democrats expressed outrage at Trump’s comments.
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. , called them “reprehensible. ”
Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that Trump's remarks are "a reprehensible invitation to violence" against witnesses in the committee's investigation.
Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. , also condemned Trump’s remarks.
“Whistleblowers who follow the rules, as this one did, are vital to protecting our safety and our freedoms,” she wrote on Twitter. “For the president to threaten this patriotic American with death demonstrates what prosecutors call ‘consciousness of guilt. ’”

Texto completo: United States Women from minority backgrounds are entering the workforce at such high levels that, for the first time, the majority of new hires in the U.S. are people of color. Economists credit a hot labor market for employers widening their hiring horizon, but research from The Washington Post also suggests a change in attitudes. Companies are increasing apprenticeship opportunities and outreach to racial minorities, and demands for Spanish-speaking jobs have doubled since 2017. (The Washington Post)
Finland A grocery chain of 900 stores launched a two-year campaign to reduce food waste. Every night at 9 o’clock, S-market takes 60% off the price of food that is about to expire, as part of the campaign. One-third of food produced around the world – valued at $680 billion – is wasted annually, according to the United Nations. A climate scientist told The New York Times that most people think of climate change as an energy-related issue, but 8% to 10% of carbon emissions come from food waste. An S-market executive says the cut-rate program is good for the company’s bottom line. (The New York Times)
New Zealand ReBicycle EkeRua gives refugees the freedom to roam. Based in Wellington, the charity is teaching newly settled refugees how to ride bikes. Refugees might spend up to three hours each day walking to and from English lessons. So far, the charity has provided more than 200 donated bikes. Volunteers say teaching adults to ride can take days or weeks, rather than hours for children. Because the demand for bike riding lessons is so high, there is a need for more volunteers who can teach. The charity also widened its reach: Locals who cannot afford bikes are now eligible, too. (The Guardian)
Thailand The work of investigative journalists led to a crackdown on labor exploitation in a western province of Thailand. Migrant workers from Myanmar weren’t receiving minimum wage in garment factories that produced goods for Bauer Hockey and Starbucks. Within a week of a Thomson Reuters Foundation report, Thailand’s anti-trafficking task force conducted raids, and factory owners must compensate workers within 30 days. Starbucks and Bauer Hockey are investigating further but did not provide comment to Reuters. Although the raids might lead to higher standards, human rights groups would like to see more long-term solutions. (Reuters)
Uganda A man in southern Uganda is innovating in the straw industry by turning to tradition. Akram Ssemambo’s ancestors used hollow stalks of sedge grass to make drinking straws. To combat single-use plastic straws – an estimated 1 billion are used daily worldwide – Mr. Ssemambo has revived the practice and started a straw company called Our Roots. The process is simple: Cut sedge stalks to size, smooth the rough ends, boil to sanitize, and dry them in the sun. The straws are reusable, and Mr. Ssemambo hopes his 100% organic products will replace 50% of Uganda’s plastic straws within five years. (Deutsche Welle)

Texto completo: They have little accountability and a lot of power.
A North Carolina prosecutor last week filed felony charges against Brindell Wilkins, the sheriff of Granville County, N.C. According to the indictment, a former deputy had recorded Sheriff Wilkins making racist comments and threatened to make them public. To protect his reputation, Sheriff Wilkins allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the deputy. This plan was concealed for years until recorded phone calls emerged between Sheriff Wilkins and the would-be killer.
Perhaps the most surprising part was the subsequent emergency meeting of the Granville Board of County Commissioners. The commissioners said North Carolina law tied their hands. While state law does provide for the removal of sheriff for reasons like "willful misconduct" and "intoxication," the county commissioners were stymied by the lack of precedent and clarity. The law does not allow the commissioners to act unilaterally and since sheriff removals are so rare, they didn't know how to proceed in such an unusual instance. (This week, Sheriff Wilkins agreed to a suspension after the Grandville County prosecutor filed a petition.)
Brindell Wilkins isn't the only badly behaved sheriff. The Los Angeles County sheriff, Alex Villanueva has been in a protracted battle with the county board of supervisors over hiring people accused of assault, protecting a deputy who faked a shooting and permitting detectives to lie under oath. Last year, The Sacramento Bee reported that the sheriff of Trinity County, Calif., Bruce Haney had moved out of state and largely stopped working, yet was still receiving his taxpayer-funded salary. He retired shortly after that became public.
But in each of these cases, local officials stood by helplessly. Why is it so hard to remove a sheriff from office, even when that person is clearly ineffective or even criminal?
Almost every county has an elected sheriff. Sheriffs serve as the primary law enforcement for many rural areas and small towns, making arrests, serving warrants and enforcing protective orders. They also help city and state police departments in various formal and informal capacities.
Sheriffs have myriad other responsibilities, as well, including operating the county jail, transporting inmates to the courthouse and evicting people. They also monitor polling places and collect taxes.
Sheriffs have a great deal of discretion in how they allocate their budget, whom they hire and whether jails are expanded or overhauled. In many states, there are few requirements to run for the office. Although their jobs require expertise, sheriffs are not vetted other than during elections, which typically have low turnout and little competition.
I spent the past year assessing the laws governing sheriff accountability and found a common theme: They lack even the most basic independent oversight and supervision. In most states, there are few or no ways to hold them accountable, even when they steal, lie or harm others. There are almost no civilian oversight commissions, no uniform disciplinary procedures, no reporting requirements in most states. In fact, sheriffs are generally afforded special protections like complete autonomy, a lack of term limits and the power to hire and fire at will, making it difficult to remove them from office.
There is a network of laws that are both hard to change -- in most states, sheriffs are written into the Constitution -- and so opaque that county governments struggle with how to handle erring sheriffs.
The problem of sheriffs is particularly acute in the South and Southwest, where the office has more power and was historically used to prop up white supremacy. Consider Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff known for his racist tactics who defended housing inmates in un-air-conditioned tents, reinstating the chain gang and making discriminatory traffic stops.
Efforts to make sheriffs more accountable have run into roadblocks created by state sheriffs associations, powerful lobbying groups that have historically opposed legislative changes and community oversight. Last year, North Carolina voters in some counties elected sheriffs who promised to limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and seek better community relations. In response, lawmakers passed a bill that would have made cooperation with ICE mandatory. (The governor vetoed the bill because it was most likely unconstitutional.)
Some people have called for eliminating the office of sheriff. Here is an even more radical idea: Sheriffs should undertake reconciliation with their communities. Otherwise, progress will be incomplete and unsatisfying. The democratic process involves more than winning elections; it must include transparency and listening. Local lawmakers should establish democratic oversight structures like a civilian complaint review board that would subject sheriffs to the same requirements for accountability as other government officials.
This month, prosecutors from around the country crossed the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., to acknowledge the role of racism in the legal system. What if we asked sheriffs to do the same? It was, after all, Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County who ordered his posse to beat, tear-gas and terrorize unarmed civil rights protesters traveling over the bridge on Bloody Sunday. Sheriffs should acknowledge the problematic role of their office in American history and reimagine a space where community control doesn't mean the power to arrest but rather the power to heal.

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Texto completo: The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are almost here – and if you're going to the games next summer, or simply want to soak up the Olympics-tinged atmosphere, you should start planning your journey.
You probably have a lot of questions. But no need to fret, dear travelers: We're here to answer everything we can.
Here's a guide to all your Tokyo-related travel questions ahead of the 2020 Olympics:
When are the Olympics?
July 24 to Aug. 9. U.S. travelers can still get a ticket, but only as part of a package. CoSport, the U.S. Olympics tickets retailer, is sold out of individual tickets but is waiting to see if it will receive more. You can sign up for their email list.Packages are available on its website that include tickets and hotel accommodation. One cheaper price, for a doubles trip, is $4,471.50 per person (for a three-night, four-event package from July 27-30).
But you might want to hurry up: "Packages are still available but are running scarce," Patricia Sweeney, a CoSport customer care associate told USA TODAY in an email.
When should I book flights for the Tokyo Olympics?
There are always deals to be had, according to Darci Valiente, a U.S. flight searcher for Scott's Cheap Flights. Valiente recommends booking at least six months in advance. "Because it's for the Olympics, prices will be even more expensive than they already are for peak travel season," Valiente told USA TODAY.
Catherine Heald, CEO and co-founder of Asia tour operator Remote Lands, recommends flying into Haneda Airport as it's closest to the city center. Tokyo's other airport is Narita International Airport.
How much should people expect to pay? Valiente recommends looking for flights under $800, depending on where they are in the U.S.
And don't necessarily set your sights on flying directly into Tokyo. "We saw flights to Osaka for peak summer more (numerous) than Toyko – so be flexible about where you fly into and consider taking the train," Valiente says.
Marian Goldberg, The New York Times Travel Show Japan travel expert, recommends booking through a Japanese or Chinese travel agency if you're connecting from Beijing or Shanghai.
Right now, flight prices are more expensive if you want to be in Tokyo for the first few days of the games and the opening ceremony, according to Valiente. The prices drop in the middle to the end of the games. Travelers looking to make a 10- to 14-day excursion may want to stagger their journey so they arrive early and leave in the middle of the games, or arrive in the middle of the games and depart post-Olympics.
Where should I stay?
Travelers have a number of options, including opting for a nearby city like Yokohama, which Amy Tadehara, a senior travel consultant at Inside Japan Tours, refers to as "Tokyo's cosmopolitan younger sibling." Hop on a train between the two in less than 40 minutes.
Edward Granville, chief operating officer at luxury travel company Red Savannah recommends booking with one of the event's official travel partners and says that the best hotels usually give up their inventory to these groups.
"Despite a construction book in preparation to the Olympics, Tokyo is looking at a massive accommodation shortfall," Japan event travel expert Alan Omlin and long-time Tokyo resident says. The Mizuho Research Institute points to a 14,000-room shortfall for the city.
Airbnb has a reduced presence in the city thanks to a law restricting Airbnb rentals. Michael Matsuo, a spokesperson for Airbnb, said some hosts haven't made their calendars open to book yet – though a search during the Olympics period for one guest warranted more than 300 places to stay, varying wildly in price.
If you decide to book a hotel, know that most Japanese hotels don't let more than three (or even two) people in one room. Rooms are also more expensive, according to Goldberg. "In fact, all Japanese-style accommodations charge per person and not per room," Goldberg says.
Chef Hiroki Odo, owner and chef of o.d.o by ODO, the speakeasy kaiseki restaurant in New York's Flatiron neighborhood, recommends a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn).
Besides the Olympics, what should I do in Tokyo?
Shibuya Crossing
Who knew a crosswalk could double as a tourist attraction? But Shibuya Crossing could be the world's busiest, according to Lonely Planet, noting that at peak times upwards of 3,000 people cross at a time. It's a scramble intersection, which means all vehicle traffic is stopped to allow pedestrians to cross in every direction, including diagonally, at the same time.
Mount Fuji
Although Mount Fuji technically isn't in Tokyo, it's just a short car, bus or train ride to the active volcano, which is also Japan's tallest mountain. Visitors can explore trails from early July to early September.
Animal cafes
Tokyo has developed a worldwide reputation for its animal cafes. In addition to getting food and drink, visitors to the cafe are treated to interaction with cute, tame animals, such as hedgehogs, meerkats and ferrets. It's a dream come true for animal lovers.
Other notable sights
Takao Nishina, travel agency GetYourGuide's regional manager for Japan, recommends the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest broadcast tower in the world, as well as the Ghibli Museum for animation fanatics and the Samurai Museum.
What else should I do?
Hakone : "Tucked up in the mountains, it's a beautiful hideaway with a gondola that goes up into the mountains and a boat ride tour that sails the gorgeous Ashino Lake," Jay Allen, the publisher of website Unseen Japan, told USA TODAY. Tadehara from Inside Japan Tours says that Hakone's elevation is a pleasant break from Tokyo's summer heat.
Kyoto : Travelers can take a bullet train to "the cultural heart of Japan," Tadehara says. Nearly 2,000 temples and shrines are in the city.
Osaka or Hiroshima : Tadehara adds that you can take a day trip to see foodie haven Osaka or even Hiroshima, where the first atomic bomb dropped.
Yokohama : Check out Minato Mirai, a portside area that has "spectacular fireworks" in the summer, according to Allen.
Kamakura : Go here to see Komachi-dori, "a rich shopping section filled with small shops and restaurants; the Great Buddha of Kamakura at the Kotoku Temple, which has been preserved from the 13th century until today; and the oceanside shoreline of Kamakura which offers spectacular sunsets," Allen says.
Getting around
The city is easy to get around via public transportation, though taxis are an affordable option. "Taxis are easy to get, most take credit cards, and they can be used affordably for short distances within a neighborhood," Goldberg says. "It's just really expensive to take a taxi to transfer between distant regions."

At 70, Springsteen still has new stories to tell, formats to explore

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock n' roll.' "
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
As Springsteen turned 70 on Monday, Sept., 23, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and of the famed Columbia Records talent scout.
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29, Jessica, 27, and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday, Sept. 29, at the historical association in Freehold.
Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
Plus, some area movie theaters are still showing the Springsteen-inspired "Blinded by the Light."
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," said Springsteen to applause on Sept. 12 at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: A supernatural drama series debuts on CBS. And Kal Penn stars in a new NBC series.
What's on TV
EVIL 10 p.m. on CBS. "Is my client possessed by a demon?" The question is posed to Dr. Kristen Bouchard, the fictional forensic psychologist at the center of this new series, during a court proceeding early in the story. The query does a tidy job of summing up what this show does: mix procedural and supernatural thrills. "Evil" is the latest series from Robert and Michelle King, the married duo behind the long-running legal drama "The Good Wife." The new series is led by the actress Katja Herbers, who plays Dr. Bouchard, and the actors Mike Colter ("Luke Cage") and Aasif Mandvi ("The Daily Show"), as an investigator and his colleague who look into potentially paranormal phenomena. In Dr. Bouchard, that pair finds a person whose expertise can help distinguish demonic possession from run-of-the-mill insanity. The first episode debuts Thursday, alongside two notable new CBS sitcoms: THE UNICORN, airing at 8:30 p.m., which casts Walton Goggins as an obliviously handsome widower wading into the dating pool, and CAROL'S SECOND ACT, at 9:30 p.m., with Patricia Heaton as a retired teacher attempting to make a midlife career pivot into medicine.
SUNNYSIDE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. Kal Penn, the comic actor who made a name for himself in "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" and "House," added the title of government employee to his résumé when he stepped away from acting to work in President Barack Obama's White House. That political experience adds a certain amount of credibility to this series, which Penn stars in and is a creator of. He plays Garrett Modi, a disgraced former New York City councilman who starts a new gig helping a group of immigrants in Queens navigate the citizenship process. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Penn described an early conversation he had when he was conceptualizing the show. "Thematically, this sounds cheesy, but I love making people laugh, and I love America," he recalled saying. "It would be great if we could do a show that makes people do both of those together." Also debuting on NBC Thursday is PERFECT HARMONY, which will air at 8:30 p.m. It stars Bradley Whitford as a snooty music professor who takes over leadership of a small-town church choir.
UNTOLD STORIES OF HIP HOP 10 p.m. on WE TV. The veteran hip-hop radio host Angie Martinez helms this new show, which promises candid interviews with A-list rappers. On offer in the first episode: conversations with Cardi B and Snoop Dogg.
What's Streaming
DOC MARTIN Stream on Acorn TV. This long-running British TV series about an irritable doctor (Martin Clunes) in Cornwall, England, has developed a dedicated following thanks in part to its quirky cast and seaside setting. In the new ninth season, the doctor's career comes under threat from complaints about his attitude. But don't count on him -- or the series -- dropping the refined impoliteness.

And maybe -- someday -- on your dog.
In a flurry of announcements on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled the latest additions to the growing list of products tied to the company's Alexa voice assistant. The devices expand the options for places in the home where Amazon has already found success, while advancing the company's hopes of getting Alexa to stay with users all day, everywhere they go.
The new products with Alexa built in include earbuds, glasses, a ring, and a tiny device for spaces like bathrooms and garages. A new dog collar tracks a pet so an owner can find its location with a smartphone.
To help keep devices connected to the internet, Amazon also unveiled Amazon Sidewalk, a low-bandwidth network that could connect smart devices across a city by piggybacking off neighbors' devices.
Dave Limp, who runs Amazon's devices business, said the gadgets put Alexa beside users "throughout the day."
The on-the-go nature of Amazon's vision for Alexa highlights the limits of the company's reach with the technology. While Amazon is the leading seller of smart speakers like the Echo, its top competitors for voice assistants, Apple and Google, have long had their assistants integrated into their smartphones.
But the devices also showed one of Amazon's advantages. Alexa is just one of many businesses where Amazon has big ambitions, along with e-commerce and cloud computing, giving the company lots of room for experiments and failures.
"They are on a track to continue to penetrate the home, and then take it out of the home," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with the market research firm Creative Strategies.
The new $ 130 Echo Buds are Amazon's answer to Apple's AirPods, with noise-reduction properties and the ability to summon Alexa. Echo Frames, a $ 180 set of experimental prescription eyeglasses, and Echo Loop, a $ 130 smart ring, have miniature microphones and speakers to communicate.
Mr. Limp also revealed a series of refinements to the core Alexa assistant, such as adapting her voice to better fit the information she conveys. Introducing pop songs, she may sound peppy; for a newscast, she might channel her inner NPR announcer. Mr. Limp also announced the ability to have Alexa speak as if she were the actor Samuel Jackson, for the cost of 99 cents.
"We've put a lot of work into her voice," Mr. Limp said.
Many of the new announcements for the kitchen and living rooms integrate screens with smart speakers, an acknowledgment that voice alone is not the most convenient way to convey some information. Rattling off a full recipe for a cake can be unhelpful, for example. A new partnership with the Food Network will provide step-by-step recipe instructions for on-demand and live cooking classes.
And although the audio quality of the Echo, the smart speaker that helped drive Alexa's popularity, has improved in recent years, Mr. Limp unveiled the $ 200 Echo Studio, which creates the experience of surround sound.
"These build the sense of space around you," Mr. Limp said. That is part of an effort to lure audiophiles with sophisticated sounds and high-definition, remastered music.
But the most quirky and experimental efforts look at ways to expand beyond those rooms. A $ 25 Echo Flex, a small box that plugs into a wall outlet, is more focused on being a basic point of entry communicating with Alexa, rather than being entertaining.
"Here you really go to the core of what Alexa is," Ms. Milanesi said. They can be used to set alarms, get the news or connect to smart home attachments such as a night light.
Mr. Limp said he had installed one in his bathroom.
"There is no reason not to put them everywhere in your house," he said.
AMAZON IS WORKING ON PRIVACY LEGISLATION. In an event with reporters on Wednesday, Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said the company would support privacy legislation, though he provided few details.
"Good regulations in this arena, I think, would be very welcome by all the players," he said.
He said Amazon was working to draft privacy legislation for facial recognition technology in particular. Amazon has come under scrutiny for the tools it sells to law enforcement, and because of uncertainty over what it does with the images from its Ring security cameras, which were included at the device showcase.
"It's a perfect example of something that has really positive uses, so you don't want to put the breaks on it," Mr. Bezos said. "At the same time, there is lots of potential for abuses with that kind of technology, so you want regulations."
He said he would welcome "good regulations" on the issue. "That kind of stability, I think, would be healthy for the whole industry," he said.
Mr. Bezos did not provide details about what the company's proposed legislation would entail.

Why there is skepticism of climate change

Texto completo: On Monday, the United Nations held its 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, which was intended to push the world into advancing "climate action" on greenhouse gas emissions. It featured government officials, speakers, activists, intellectuals and academics, and of course plenty of scientists.
On Tuesday, I had a long conversation with a friend of mine, who happens to be a scientist. He holds a Ph.D. in microbiology, so my natural assumption was that he would be among the group of people that sided with climate change being "settled science" because "scientists say so."
What I discovered was that while he was no climate change denier, he was no alarmist. As we discussed some of what was talked about at the summit, he said to me that even for him "it has become very hard to determine what is rational science, and what is simply hyperbolic political rhetoric."
If some level of skepticism has penetrated even the mind of my very scientific friend, than such skepticism has advanced quite far. Which begs an interesting question.
Why, exactly, is so much of the public skeptical of all that apocalypse talk? Why are they so dismissive and hostile to the attempts to save the world?
"Deniers," as they are so derisively called, are actually based in the endless chicken little paranoia, and boy-who-cried-wolf manipulations that the public at large has been subjected to.
Put simply, when you are told the world is going to end in only a few short years unless we do something, it had damn well better end, because if it doesn't, we'll notice. When you say it is going to end repeatedly, and it doesn't, people stop believing you.
In 1969, Professor Bob Ehrlich of Stanford University warned that environmental degradation was such a problem that unless we were very lucky, within 20 years humanity would "disappear into a cloud of blue steam."
In 1970, James P. Lodge Jr., a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, warned that air pollution may "blot out the sun" and "cause a new ice age" in the first third of the 21st century.
In 1971, NASA scientist Dr. S.I. Rasool was quoted in the Washington Post warning of the very same problem. He said that within the next 50 years, air pollutants could lower the temperature of the earth by up to 6 degrees, and may indeed trigger a new ice age.
In 1974, Time Magazine published a story on the "coming ice age," pointing out that the mean global temperature of earth had dropped about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit since the 1940s, and "signs were everywhere" that the ice age was coming.
In 1978 the New York Times published an alarming story that said that there was "no end in sight" to the now 30-year-long trend in "global cooling."
In 1988, noting the particularly hot summer in the Washington, D.C. area, NASA scientist James Hansen predicted that the number of days in Washington that registered 90 degrees or more would more than double, and that global ocean levels would rise by up to six feet within 50 years. Neither has happened.
Salon noted Hansen's prediction in 1989 that New York City's West Side Highway would be underwater by 2019.
And none of that even begins to touch the many, many apocalyptic predictions by people like Al Gore that have failed to come true.
Which brings us to where we are today, with a country and indeed an entire world that have become exhausted by the hyperbole and the dire predictions being made by a never-ending parade of scientists and politicians -- and now even very angry teenagers -- urging us to "do something" to fix the problem.
If you wonder why some people don't share that belief, just understand that it most likely comes from a lot of promised apocalypses that never happened.

Ukraine inquiry may bite Biden

Texto completo: We don't yet know whether President Trump delayed some military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Ukraine's president to reopen an investigation into Hunter Biden. But if we are concerned about U.S. officials inappropriately threatening aid to Ukraine, then there are others who have some explaining to do.
It got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., wrote a letter to Ukraine's prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as "strong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine," the Democratic senators declared, "We have supported (the) capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these (democratic) principles to avoid the ire of President Trump," before demanding Lutsenko "reverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation."
So, it's OK for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it's not OK for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?
And then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country's top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, "Among those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden ... who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general." The Washington Post reports that it is "unclear how seriously Shokin - who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall - was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out." But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: "I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' ... He got fired."
This weekend, Biden told reporters, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings." That is flatly untrue. Hunter admitted in an interview with the New Yorker that his father expressed concern about the Burisma post at least once: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing,' and I said, 'I do.' " Moreover, the New Yorker reports that, "In December 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter's relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration's special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden."
So, Biden was fully aware of his son's involvement with Burisma when he pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor in 2016. He should have known that his using U.S. aid as leverage to force the prosecutor's dismissal would create, at a bare minimum, the appearance of a conflict of interest.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced Congress will initiate a formal impeachment inquiry over the Ukraine episode, a move Joe Biden endorsed in a speech, declaring, "It's time for the Congress to fully investigate the conduct of this president." Such an investigation will be far more damaging for Biden than the president. It will keep the story of Biden's conflict of interest in the news through the 2020 election. Senate Republicans can demand that Hunter Biden testify, and subpoena Obama White House aides to explain under oath what the vice president knew and when he knew it.
Put aside the prosecutor's firing. Hunter took the position with a Ukrainian natural gas company just a few weeks after his father visited Ukraine in 2014 to urge its government to increase its natural gas production. He had no expertise in Ukraine or natural gas. It will not just be Republicans calling this suspicious; nonpartisan experts in ethics law will testify that this a major conflict of interest.
And the focus will not just be on Ukraine but also how, as the Post reported, "for more than two decades, (Hunter's) professional work often tracked with his father's life in politics, from Washington to Ukraine to China."
While Senate Republicans will not remove Trump from office, Democratic primary voters might decide that Biden and his troubles are a distraction they do not need. The irony is the Democrats' investigation might do more to deny Biden the presidency than Trump.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin says he doesn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be provided to Congress, nor should a transcript of President Donald Trump's call with the Ukrainian president. "It's a very dangerous precedent," he said of releasing the call.

Texto completo: UNITED NATIONS - President Donald Trump said he would release on Wednesday a "fully declassified and unredacted" transcript of his July phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky amid increasing scrutiny of an exchange that reportedly involved Trump's request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
"I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine," Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon.
In follow-up tweets and statements to reporters, Trump continued to deny he made any improper requests of Zelensky, and he accused congressional Democrats of engaging in "presidential harassment!" after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced House Democrats were launching a formal impeachment inquiry.
"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call," Trump said on Twitter.
Trump dismissed news reports indicating he called on White House and Pentagon officials to withhold $400 million in U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine before pressing Zelensky to investigate Biden, who is staging a bid to unseat Trump in 2020, and who routinely leads Trump in national polls.
The Washington Post and New York Times reported late Monday night that Trump had directed his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to order a hold on the foreign aid before his July 25 call with Zelensky.
"As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid, they were fully paid," Trump told reporters just before he was slated to address the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump said he initially called for the military aid funding to be withheld to ensure other European countries were also contributing aid to Ukraine.
"I want other countries to put up money.... Germany, France, other countries should put up money," Trump told reporters.
The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros - nearly $16.5 billion - in aid to Ukraine since 2014, in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea, according to figures available on the E.U. website.
Trump, taking questions from reporters at the top of a meeting with the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, acknowledged asking Mulvaney to withhold the aid, and said he also discussed the matter with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
The Post, citing officials familiar with Trump's request, said administration officials were told to tell lawmakers inquiring about the delayed funding that the delays were part of an "interagency process." The money was withheld for nearly two months, until released on Sept. 11.
Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky is reportedly the source of a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times have reported that Trump, on the call, repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden's role as a board member of a Ukrainian gas company. Ukraine's current prosecutor has said there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, according to a report by Bloomberg News.
Congressional Democrats have demanded the White House release a transcript of the call and have called for hearings into the whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration has refused to turn over to lawmakers as required by law.
A growing number of Democrats have called for impeachment hearings citing their concerns that the president may have pressed a foreign nation for political dirt.
Asked about the calls for impeachment, Trump told reporters: "I think it's ridiculous. It's a witch hunt."
"They have no idea how they stop me the only way they can try is through impeachment," Trump said. "It's nonsense, and when you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you'll see at some point, you'll understand. That call was perfect."
The transcript's release coincides with Trump's expected 2 p.m. meeting with Zelensky at the UN on Wednesday. The president is also scheduled to address reporters at a previously scheduled 4 p.m. news conference.

Texto completo: NBC's newest comedy is set in the political scene in Sunnyside, Queens, and it just might make an ideal acting debut for City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer.
Van Bramer, who's represented the neighborhood since 2010, says he's interested in appearing in the network's new series, "Sunnyside." Premiering Thursday, the show stars "Harold & Kumar" actor Kal Penn as a disgraced, former council member seeking reelection. 
"I have offered my services to the show and they are filming in L.A., sadly," Van Bramer says. "But, they said if they do come to Sunnyside to shoot some scenes, they will keep me in mind. I don't have my SAG [Screen Actors Guild] card just yet, but we're hoping for one."
The series, created by Penn, follows his character, Garrett Modi, as he's thrown out of office after a video of his public intoxication arrest on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway goes viral. Modi, at a low point of his career, crafts a master plan to seek reelection, but gets distracted when a group of young immigrants seeks his assistance passing their naturalization tests for citizenship.
The series is filmed on a soundstage at Universal Studios Hollywood but uses the diverse Queens neighborhood as its central location.  
"We are very excited," Van Bramer says. "The whole neighborhood is thrilled, tickled a little bit to see our beloved Sunnyside become a national sensation, we hope. It's also going to be fun to watch and see how the neighborhood is showcased." 
Van Bramer reached out to offer his congratulations to Penn on Twitter when the series was picked up in May. He didn't get a response, but the tweet ended up opening an eventual line of communication with the network.
"While I didn't get retweeted, I saw Kal Penn at a Pete Buttigieg event a few months ago and when I walked up to him and introduced myself as the council member from Sunnyside he said, 'We know, you tweeted at us. We've been talking about you!'"
The councilman, who also represents Astoria, Long Island City and Woodside, connected with the series' writers and producers via Skype to discuss the neighborhood and his political role. 
"We did about an hour and a half Skype interview. They asked me all sorts of questions about what it's like to be a council member, what it's like to be in Sunnyside. ... I appreciate their attention to detail and their desire to get it right."
Penn, speaking to The New York Times, says he chose the area as the setting for his comedy because it's one of the city's most diverse neighborhoods and "'Flushing' is truly a terrible title for a show." 
While "Sunnyside" has a political undertone, the central focus of the series shifts away from City Council within the first few minutes of the pilot episode, when Modi is literally kicked out of his office. It is, at its core, a comedy. 
"It's a lot of fun and I think Kal Penn is a very talented writer and actor. I know they want to keep it funny and light, but also talk about some of the things that immigrants in Queens are faced with."
Offering some advice to Modi on recapturing the support of Sunnyside residents, Van Bramer says: "Well, you should stay out of trouble, No. 1."
He continues: "I would say any candidate for City Council in Sunnyside should care a lot about quality of life issues, walk the streets and be present. Knock on a lot of doors and have an engaging personality. People want to connect with elected officials and candidates and know that they're genuine human beings - real people - because often we're not portrayed as real live human beings. That's what I would offer to Kal Penn's character and wish him luck." 
"Sunnyside" makes its debut on NB

A Beating Heart, Even After Death

Texto completo: LVADs are changing human life. Are we ready?
Shows like HBO's "Westworld" and the "Blade Runner" films depict a dystopian future where humankind and machine have merged, blurring the line between people and robots. As a cardiologist, I find myself face to face with both the promise and the peril of such a marriage -- a reality for me and my patients rather than a distant hypothetical.
Tens of thousands of Americans today have mechanical pumps keeping them alive, offering the first serious glimpse of what the union of human and machine will look like. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are sutured right into the hearts of patients with severe heart failure, mechanizing them to keep blood circulating throughout the body. While they don't quite turn into cyborgs, most patients with LVADs don't have a pulse, and if you put a stethoscope to their chest, instead of hearing the galloping of their heart, you would hear the hum of the pump.
As we move into the post-evolutionary phase of our species, for this union to be a boon to humankind rather than the bane of our existence, we need to ensure that ethical discourse and regulatory oversight keep up.
We have sought to restore our bodies with things like artificial hips to replace arthritic joints or contact lenses to sharpen blurry vision, but never before have we given a home inside our body to technology that fundamentally changes the human experience. LVADs are pushing bodies into places unforeseen: They can survive even if their hearts stop beating, something previously unimaginable. The devices are also teaching us what happens when blood flows continuously through the body rather than in pulses with every beat of the heart.
While many patients with LVADs can experience devastating complications such as strokes, bleeds and infections, many achieve previously unimaginable outcomes. The devices may soon help people with severe heart failure to live longer than those with the gold standard: a transplanted heart, which has shown to extend the lives of patients for an average of 11 years. A trial of the newest generation of pumps, called Momentum 3, showed that the two-year survival rate of patients with LVADs is creeping closer to that of patients who receive a human heart.
"LVADs are now more forgiving in terms of complication rates and the need for constant complex care," said Mandeep Mehra, medical director of the at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Heart and Vascular Center, a professor at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator of the study. "The main objective of LVADs in elderly patients is to not just add years to their lives but life to their years."
These improvements have led some of my patients with an LVAD to reject the opportunity to have it replaced with a transplanted heart. And just last year, researchers developed a prototype LVAD that charges wirelessly rather than through large batteries patients have to wear in special vests or in belts, making it easier to live with and letting many patients do what they cannot with current LVADs: swim.
"The next generation of devices need to become fully internalized like a pacemaker so that the person is not constantly reminded that they are a patient," said Dr. Mehra.
I have witnessed LVADs giving some of my patients the opportunity to attend their grandchildren's weddings and letting others to return to work, but this technology comes with its own set of drawbacks. While an LVAD, as long as it functions appropriately, is somewhat immortal and can be replaced with a surgical procedure, the rest of the human body continues to age. An LVAD can keep pumping blood, even as all the other organs in the body fall apart. It can push blood furiously through a body even after it has died.
The early days of new medical advances are often rocky, based on the incremental nature of technology, so it is critical that we fully prepare patients for what to expect. Yet as a 2017 study showed, when patients were provided unbiased information on the pros and cons of LVAD therapy, fewer went ahead with the implantation. Though the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandate involvement of palliative care for all patients receiving LVADs, many hospitals see this as only a box to check, providing lip service to this requirement. It should be mandatory for patients to be provided unbiased information and to have a formal consult with a palliative care clinician.
Despite what LVADs and other new medical technology can achieve, we need to ensure that the enthusiasm to advance the human condition does not circumvent appropriate regulatory oversight. Already there have been recalls of hundreds of thousands of pacemakers because of hacking vulnerabilities. Such safeguards need to be ensured for LVADs as well. The last generation of LVADs experienced an unexpected spike in the formation of blood clots in the pump. This was never fully explained, amplifying the need for continued vigilance.
We also need to ensure that everyone has access to medical technology, rather than only the affluent. We have seen this with expensive medications, but in a future where people upgrade their organs as they do crooked noses and slender lips, unequal access could very much lead to a caste system with a life span booster as much a status symbol as the artificial augmentation of the human body. We must debate about the consequences of these therapies as they are developed rather than react when the unforeseen occurs.
Finally, we need to ensure that LVADs help us to live not only longer but also better. Instead of focusing on individual organs, we should strive to look at the whole person and how an LVAD might fit in that individual's and his or her caregiver's life. The best way to do that is to ensure that we get people the help they need, including changes in lifestyle and evidence-based medications to prevent heart failure, such that an LVAD is never needed.

The New York Times accidentally exposes a high-level intelligence leak

Texto completo: New York Times Publisher Arthur G. Sulzberger has an opinion piece in Wednesday's edition lamenting the growing attacks on press freedom worldwide. Sulzberger is, of course, correct. Independent journalism has always been a risky endeavor in China, Russia, Iran, Iraqi Kurdistan, and across most Arab states, for example, but it is now becoming increasingly dangerous in places like Turkey, Poland, and Hungary.
It is about Egypt, however, that his article suggests a serious breach of intelligence by a rogue American official. Sulzberger explains:
Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials. But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn. We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger.
Sulzberger’s animus toward President Trump may be burying the lede. For an American official to know in advance that Egyptian security officials planned to arrest Walsh would require one of two things: either a human intelligence source inside the Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate or an intercept of communications within the General Intelligence Directorate.
While tipping off Walsh, without telling him the reason, might be have been both wise and humane, for a rogue employee to call Sulzberger (and on an open line at that) basically signaled to Egypt’s government either that they were penetrated or otherwise compromised. Given Trump’s antics as well as the cartoonish coverage of the president often consumed by those entirely inside a bubble antagonistic to him, it is easy to assume the worst about his instincts and motives. But given the circle within Cairo that knew of the supposed detention order for Walsh was extremely small, it is quite possible that the apparent lack of immediate action was due more to protect sources and methods.
The apparent intelligence leak in question, therefore, likely involved top secret/sensitive compartmented information — the type whose leak can put lives in danger. That Sulzberger reveals such leaks are common simply underscores the belief in the White House that the intelligence community or foreign service have become political actors and that the firewall between professionalism and political activism has broken down.
This is not to minimize the situation Walsh faced, if Sulzberger’s recollections are accurate. Egypt under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi today has become eerily similar to 1970s-era Iraq, when the belief that the strongman ensured moderation was enough for U.S. officials to paper over the leaders' dictatorial tendencies and increasingly credible reports of human rights violations.
That Walsh left Egypt without incident is a good thing. But plugging the leak within the intelligence community or the State Department is crucial lest fear of leaks convinces future administrations to make policy without their counsel.

Texto completo: Is it too much to ask that we wait first to find out exactly what was said in a private phone call in July between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before we start throwing about words such as “treason” and “impeachment” and even discussing an execution?
The answer is: yes. Yes, it is too much to ask.
Democrats and journalists have found a new favorite story that they say could spell the end for the Trump administration. The allegation is this: Trump tried to pressure Zelensky, with the promise of U.S. aid, into investigating Democratic front-runner Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, with the explicit intention of interfering in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. There is no hard evidence this happened, but that is the story anyway. Just ignore the part where we have gone down this exact road before with over-hyped allegations against the White House, badly misled by partisan lawmakers and sloppy journalists all too eager to see the Trump-era brought to an early conclusion.
"It is a betrayal of the office at the scale of which I haven’t seen in my lifetime,” declared 2020 Democratic primary candidate New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. “I’d have to go back to, God, I don’t think Watergate even compares to what this is.”
He added, “[Trump] needs to answer for this should the facts bear out. ... This is a deep potential violation of our Constitution, of our values. And it is an impeachable offense."
“It’s treason, pure and simple," 2020 GOP primary candidate Bill Weld said elsewhere this week, "and the penalty for treason under the U.S. code is death. That’s the only penalty,”
Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reportedly talking privately about bringing articles of impeachment against the president.
The Washington Post reports:
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been quietly sounding out top allies and lawmakers about whether the time has come to impeach President Trump, a major development as several moderate House Democrats resistant to impeachment suddenly endorsed the extraordinary step of trying to oust the president. Pelosi, according to multiple senior House Democrats and congressional aides, has been gauging the mood of her caucus members about whether they believe that allegations that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a political foe are a tipping point. She was making calls as late as Monday night, and many leadership aides who once thought Trump’s impeachment was unlikely now say they think it’s almost inevitable.
For the record, no one outside the White House or the Ukrainian government knows what was said in that phone call. All we have right now is a “whistleblower” who claims to have heard from another source (he did not hear it himself) that the president pressed Ukraine’s leader to investigate the 2020 Democratic front-runner and Trump admitting he discussed the Bidens with Zelensky. Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy also claims Zelensky told him privately that he was concerned U.S. aid “was being cut off” by Trump as a “consequence” of the Ukrainian government’s reluctance to investigate the Bidens. Then again, the New York Times also reported this week that “Trump did not discuss the delay in the military assistance on the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky.”
This may be a scandal for the White House or the Bidens or both. Then again, it may be nothing. We cannot know until we have more information. We need, for example, the "whistleblower's" complaint. At a bare minimum, we need to know what was said in the July phone call.TweetUntil then, the best we can do is speculate. Like this:

The “if” and “if true” qualifiers in these headlines and op-eds better be careful. They might break their backs doing all that heavy lifting.

Texto completo: Ravens coach John Harbaugh rolled the dice in his team's 33-28 loss Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, opting to go for it on fourth down several times and attempt multiple 2-point conversions.
He had mixed results in the gambles and some of his decisions proved pivotal in an eventual one-possession game.
After the game, Harbaugh said that the analytics backed his decisions and he doubled down on his fearlessness, saying, "We don't play scared." He provided more insight into his decision-making process and the use of analytics Monday at his weekly news conference.
"It's part of what we do," Harbaugh said. "It's not all what we do. I have a good understanding of the numbers and how it works. I have people in my ear that help with that as well, which is important. Not just with that, but with challenges and things like that. We're very organized in what we do and we have a method and a process. It's very detailed and well-thought-out.
"We're standing by our decisions. Our decisions gave us the best chance to win the game, in that particular game. These are not like league average choices. These are determined by this game and for this game specifically, in that venue. Weather is even factored into it. ... It wasn't a field position game. It was a possession game. Making the most of each possession was what counted."
Analytics and advanced metrics have studied when going for 2 and attempting fourth-down conversions are appropriate. Using statistics from FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times 4th Down Bot, The Baltimore Sun looked into whether Harbaugh's claim was accurate.
Note that while the analytics might say to make a certain decision, the situation matters as well, and the numbers don't account for that.
Situation 1: First quarter, 5:08 remaining. Game tied 0-0, Ravens attempt fourth-and-3 from Kansas City 9 (success)
Analytics say:Go for it. According to the NYT 4th Down Bot, the general rule of thumb on fourth-and-3 is to "go for it almost everywhere beyond your 40. ... As the down-to-go distance increases, your chances of successfully converting a first down become smaller - and the decisions become more nuanced."
Early in the game with the score tied, the Ravens aimed to get the ball in the end zone instead of settling for a short field goal and succeeded. Had they failed, the Chiefs would have taken over deep in their own territory and had to drive the length of the field to score.
Situation 2: First quarter, 4:24. Ravens lead 6-0, attempt 2-point conversion (failed)
Analytics say: Toss up. According to FiveThirtyEight, the estimated change in win probability, had the Ravens converted the attempt, was 3.3% (vs. 5.2% if they had kicked the extra point). However, because of a penalty, they were on the 1-yard line.
But that early in the game, such a risk likely wasn't warranted. The Chiefs scored on the following possession and took a one-point lead with the extra point.
Only one other team through three weeks has attempted a 2-point conversion with a 6-point lead following a touchdown. The Buffalo Bills went for 2 - from the 1-yard line, like the Ravens - against the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday and converted.
Situation 3: Second quarter, 13:26. Chiefs lead 7-6, Ravens attempt fourth-and-1 from Baltimore 34 (success)
Analytics say: Go for it. According to the NYT 4th Down Bot, "on fourth-and-1, go for it any place on the field where that is possible, starting at your 9-yard line."
A 5-yard gain from running back Gus Edwards extended the Ravens' second drive of the game, as they looked to retake the lead. The team later failed on another fourth-down try, but the analytics support going for it with such a short distance to gain.
Situation 4: Second quarter, 10:38. Chiefs lead 7-6, Ravens attempt fourth-and-2 from Baltimore 47 (failed)
Analytics say:Go for it. According to the NYT 4th Down Bot, "on fourth-and-2, go for it everywhere beyond your 28-yard line."
Quarterback Lamar Jackson threw a low pass to wide receiver Marquise "Hollywood" Brown, which fell incomplete. The Chiefs took advantage of the short field, using five plays to score a touchdown and take a 14-6 lead.
Situation 5: Fourth quarter, 13:21. Chiefs lead 30-13, Ravens attempt fourth-and-5 from Kansas City 27 (success)
Analytics say: Take the field goal. According to the NYT 4th Down Bot, "on fourth-and-5, go for it between midfield and your opponent's 33."
However, with a three-possession deficit, touchdowns trumped field goals at this point, so going for it was probably the better decision. Jackson completed a miraculous 25-yard heave while being tackled to wide receiver Seth Roberts. Running back Mark Ingram II scored two plays later.
Situation 6: Fourth quarter, 12:22. Chiefs lead 30-19, Ravens attempt 2-point conversion (failed)
Analytics say: Go for 2. According to FiveThirtyEight, the Ravens' estimated change in win probability, had they converted the attempt, was 2.2% (vs. 1.3% if they kicked the extra point).
Jackson's pass to tight end Nick Boyle was incomplete. If the Ravens had gone for the extra point, they would have closed the deficit to 10, where a touchdown (with the extra point) and a field goal would tie the game. The failed attempt essentially forced the Ravens to try another 2-point conversion when they scored a touchdown again.
"Getting it [the deficit] to nine gives you a much better chance of winning than taking it into overtime," Harbaugh said. "You still have a chance to do that with the second [2-point conversion attempt]. If for some reason they got to kick a field goal or score a touchdown, it also enhances your odds.
"While you may think that getting 10 is the thing to do, it's the thing to do if you want to go into overtime. It's not the thing to do if you want to win the game in regulation, and that's what we were trying to do."
Situation 7: Fourth quarter, 2:01. Chiefs lead 33-28, Ravens attempt 2-point conversion (failed)
Analytics say: Go for 2. According to FiveThirtyEight, the Ravens' estimated change in win probability, had they converted the attempt, was 5% (vs. 2.9% if they had kicked the extra point).
As stated, the previous failed attempts forced the Ravens into another try to bring the score within a field goal. The Chiefs converted a third-and-9 on the following possession and the Ravens had no timeouts, effectively clinching the game.

Texto completo: The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint – presumably Trump himself – is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress – not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law – to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney, a fellow republican, on twitter for losing the Presidential election seven years ago.
The President’s tweet consists of a video montage containing short clips of 2012 election-night coverage, showing Romney losing to President Barack Obama, and 2016 election-night footage, displaying Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, complete with Trump touting of Romney's 2012 run: "That was a race, I have to say folks, that should have been won. "
While Trump endorsed Romney in his 2012 presidential race, the two clashed frequently during Trump’s run in 2016. During the primaries, Romney delivered a high-profile speech attacking Trump; Trump called Romney a loser.
The two made up after Trump’s win - he interviewed Romney for the Secretary of State job - but have always had an uneasy relationship, especially after Romney won his Senate race.
Though the tweet doesn’t explicitly explain the reasoning, it follows just hours after Romney called for more information surrounding updates from the original Wall Street Journal report that stated Trump repeatedly pressured Ukranian President Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, former vice president Joe Biden's son, during a phone call, and to work with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
That phone call is reportedly the subject of a whistleblower complaint by a U. S. intelligence official, according to both the Washington Post and The New York Times.
Saying it is "critical for the facts to come out," the Utah senator tweeted Sunday: "If the President asked or pressured Ukraine’s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. ”
On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he discussed Biden during a phone call on July 25 with Zelensky, saying the "The conversation I had was largely congratulatory. "
However, during a meeting Monday at the United Nations, Trump claimed that he "didn’t do it. ” He also said that he hoped people would see a transcript of the call because they would be “very disappointed. ”
When asked if the transcript should be given to Congress, Romney answered, "Let's see the transcript. "
The prominent GOP senator was one of the first to raise in his party concern over the allegations, and remains one of only a few Republicans that have called the Trump-Ukraine allegations “serious. ”
The video Trump tweeted today is a re-share of a video posted in April of the President saying if Romney "spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe)!" after the Utah Senator "sickened" of the conduct displayed Mueller report.

How to make layoffs less terrible

Texto completo: It's no secret that large companies struggle at times to treat their employees humanely. Many businesses, especially one of my favorite punching bags, General Motors, still opt for a traditionally heartless approach to layoffs.
Other companies have found slightly more generous approaches -- recently Ford showed a little kindness by giving employees a few days to pack up their things and say goodbye to co-workers -- but companies can do better than that.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, along with other top CEOs, seems to agree. They recently expressed their belief that companies have a real responsibility to stakeholders like customers and employees. Dimon and the others said, in an ad they took out in The New York Times, that businesses can't focus solely on shareholders. The regular working stiff matters too.
That's where a recent WSJ report provided a little hope. It turns out that several large German companies are enacting more socially responsible approaches as they face economic turbulence or stagnant revenue. Here are some of those approaches, which American companies can learn a thing or two from.

Work-time accounts and early retirement
Diesel components giant Bosch is one of the better examples of companies trying more humane approaches to downsizing.
The company directly negotiated with labor representatives (a much more common practice in Germany) to come to agreements on cutting staff. They decided to use something called work-time accounts, which aren't well known in the U.S. Essentially, with these accounts, employees stock up on overtime pay when times are good, and can then access that money when their hours get cut during a downturn.
Bosch also hired fewer temporary workers and used severance programs and early retirement offers to shrink their workforce.
One of the aspects of this strategy that feels more sustainable to me is that by avoiding drastic cuts, companies like Bosch don't have to suddenly hire a bunch of new people who need training when the market bounces back. The approach helps companies maintain a better balance between workforce costs and revenue while continuing to give workers some type of paycheck. It's more stable for everyone involved.

Plant retooling
Then, there's Volkswagen. Company executives saw financial trouble and announced more than 20,000 layoffs. But they avoided any "forced layoffs."
The German car company started retooling three plants so that it would need fewer workers. The reduction plan includes not replacing certain administrative and factory positions over the next five years. As the Baby Boomer workers that occupy those jobs near retirement, Volkswagen will provide early retirement packages and remove those positions.
The factory retooling also involves ramping up electric vehicle production. This again feels more sustainable than other companies' approaches. Volkswagen is cutting the workforce more slowly while also addressing changing vehicle market demands, all in one plan.

Buyouts
Bayer is handling the need to reduce its workforce in a way similar to Volkswagen's. The German pharmaceutical giant is offering generous buyout packages that include up to five years of severance pay.
This gives Bayer more control over workforce reductions. Plus, it can reduce confrontations between management and workforce that lead to strikes. Although the severance packages are expensive, they tend to be a better deal than the expenses involved in dealing with those lengthy labor strikes.
Part of why these German companies are seeking more humane solutions is rooted in German legal history. The country's labor law states that the supervisory board of any company with more than 2,000 employees has to be made up of half shareholders and half labor representatives. The approach balances employee interests with those of shareholders.
American law doesn't require companies to take worker needs into consideration this extensively. And you can make the case this causes more harm than good. Investors might be more inclined to put their trust in companies that avoid making large-scale, herky-jerky layoffs. Those equal instability, not only for the company but for thousands of former workers, as well as the regions they're from.
It's inherently smarter to lay off people more strategically. Many of your workers may be interested in early retirement or some kind of special severance package. Why not take advantage of that? It should be an attractive option to many entrepreneurs, especially those with the foresight to know that if they lay off too many people they'll just have to train new workers and lose organizational knowledge should the economic climate improve (and then go south again).
These socially responsible best practices may be especially critical with signs and predictions of a looming recessionary period. Hopefully, more American entrepreneurs realize this and make changes that will help their businesses and the economy overall.

Texto completo: From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
Car payments are so prevalent in society today that people think they're a normal part of life. But if you took the average car payment of $545 and invested it into a Roth IRA instead, 30 years later you'd be sitting on a cool $1.4million.
Look, I like my car too – but not that much!
For me, that's motivation enough to save up and pay cash for a car instead of financing one. But I get plenty of objections to this way of thinking.
Here are some of the excuses I hear. And the truth about them:
'But the 0% interest rate is a great deal!' No, it's not. That new car starts losing value the instant you drive it off the lot.
From the first month of ownership, you'd owe more on your car than it's worth. Four years later, you'd still have a year or two of payments left, but your car would've lost most of its value.
And let's not forget that 0% is not the same as cash, and not everyone who falls for the 0% marketing pitch actually qualifies for the deal. But by then, you're already in love with the car of your dreams and are willing to sign anything to drive it home. And of course, some of those "deals" aren't quite as attractive once you read the fine print.
Making money off car loans is their business. You're not outsmarting anyone!
'I just had a baby, so I need a "safe" car. . . like a new Tahoe.' This is one I hear all the time from people I know who have kids – especially new parents. Do babies take up more room? Yes. Do you want your baby to be safe in the car? Yes! But those things don't equal a new SUV. Safe does not equal new.
There are plenty of safe, preowned cars out there. And you shouldn't let your desire to keep up with the Joneses drive your money habits and decisions. The Joneses are broke. Keeping up with broke people who are just trying to look rich is a really bad plan.
'How am I supposed to buy a car without a car loan?' Save up and pay cash for your cars. Yep, I mean it!
All it takes is making the decision to pay yourself instead of the bank. If you have a car loan, go crazy and pay it off quickly. Or, sell it to get the process rolling to pay yourself instead of the bank.
The first car you buy with cash might not be your dream car, but that's okay. Just because it's not your dream car doesn't mean it has to be a junker. Pick out a car with a body style that doesn't change often. I can't tell you how many luxury-brand cars I see on the road, and yet have no idea what year they were made.
The moral of the story is simple. Own your cars. Don't let them own you!

In Show of Political Power, Arab Lawmakers Back Gantz to Lead Israel

Texto completo: JERUSALEM -- After 27 years of sitting out decisions on who should lead Israel, Arab lawmakers on Sunday recommended that Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief, get the first chance to form a government over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a watershed assertion of political power.
Ayman Odeh, the leader of the Arab Joint List, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed published on Sunday that the alliance's 13 incoming lawmakers -- the third-largest faction in the newly elected Parliament -- had decided to recommend Mr. Gantz because it would "create the majority needed to prevent another term for Mr. Netanyahu."
"It should be the end of his political career," Mr. Odeh wrote.
The Arab lawmakers' recommendation, which Mr. Odeh and other members of the Joint List delivered to President Reuven Rivlin in a face-to-face meeting Sunday evening, reflected Arab citizens' impatience to integrate more fully into Israeli society and to have their concerns be given greater weight by Israeli lawmakers.
"There is no doubt a historic aspect to what we are doing now," Mr. Odeh said in the meeting with the president, which was broadcast live.
Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party responded furiously to the Joint List's recommendation, continuing an anti-Arab campaign as if the election was yet to take place.
"There are now two options," Mr. Netanyahu said in a video clip soon after the meeting between members of the Joint List and the president. "Either there will be a minority government that relies on those who reject Israel as a Jewish and democratic state and glorify terrorists who murder our soldiers and civilians, or there will be a broad national government."
"I know what the answer is and so do you," he continued, "which is why I will work as hard as I can to form a broad national unity government."
There was no immediate word from Mr. Gantz or his Blue and White party.
The Joint List's recommendation was a striking act of comeuppance for Mr. Netanyahu, who for years had rallied his right-wing supporters by inflaming anti-Arab sentiments. Before the Sept. 17 election, he accused Arab politicians of trying to steal the election and at one point accused them of wanting to "destroy us all."
Israeli Arabs "have chosen to reject Benjamin Netanyahu, his politics of fear and hate, and the inequality and division he advanced for the past decade," Mr. Odeh wrote in the Op-Ed for The Times.
It was all the more surprising that the Arab lawmakers chose to end a quarter-century of noninvolvement by endorsing Mr. Gantz, a former army chief of staff. He led a devastating, 50-day war against the militant groups in Gaza five years ago. Blue and White has three former military chiefs in its top four slots, who appeared in a past campaign video in full battle dress.
In a further gesture of outreach to the Israeli mainstream, Mr. Odeh quoted from Psalms 118:22, telling Mr. Rivlin, in Hebrew, "The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone" -- a verse cited in Jewish and Christian scriptures and liturgies.
Still, even though the Joint List recommended that Mr. Gantz be asked first to form a government, Mr. Odeh wrote that the group would not itself enter a government led by Mr. Gantz because he had not agreed to embrace its entire "equality agenda."
That agenda consists of various positions, among them, changing housing and planning laws to treat Arab and Jewish neighborhoods the same; resuming peace talks with the Palestinians; and repealing the law passed last year that declared Israel the nation-state only of the Jewish people.
Also, one of several predominantly Arab parties making up the Joint List, Balad, which accounts for three of the alliance's 13 seats, opposed recommending Mr. Gantz. Its representatives did not attend the meeting with the president. Some Arab lawmakers described Mr. Gantz as a "default choice."
The last time Arab lawmakers recommended a prime minister was in 1992, when two Arab parties with a total of five seats in Parliament recommended Yitzhak Rabin -- another former chief of staff -- though they did not join his government.
"We have decided to demonstrate that Arab Palestinian citizens can no longer be rejected or ignored," Mr. Odeh wrote.
In the 1992 election, Mr. Rabin initially held a narrow majority in the 120-seat Knesset even without the Arab parties' support, though he came to rely on it a year later after Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party, quit the government when Mr. Rabin signed the Oslo peace accords.
Mr. Odeh wrote that the decision to support Mr. Gantz was meant as "a clear message that the only future for this country is a shared future, and there is no shared future without the full and equal participation of Palestinian citizens."
Mr. Gantz narrowly edged the prime minister in the national election last Tuesday. Afterward, both candidates called for unity, but differed on how to achieve it.
The former army chief appears to lack a 61-seat majority even with the Joint List's support.
He emerged from the election with 57 seats, including those of allies on the left and the Joint List, compared with 55 seats for Mr. Netanyahu and his right-wing allies.
Some analysts questioned whether Balad's three seats would ultimately be counted as being on Mr. Gantz's side, since Balad refused to endorse him, potentially leaving Mr. Gantz with only 54 supporters.
Avigdor Liberman, leader of the secular, right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, which won eight seats, is in position to be a kingmaker, but said on Sunday that he would not recommend any candidate. He said Mr. Odeh and the Joint List were not merely political opponents, but "the enemies" and belonged in the "Parliament in Ramallah," not in the Knesset.
Mr. Liberman said that Mr. Gantz called him on Sunday night, and that the pair agreed to meet on Monday.
Mr. Rivlin began hearing the recommendations of each major party Sunday evening and was to finish on Monday, before entrusting the task of forming a government to whichever candidate he believes has the best chance of being successful.
In remarks at the start of that process, Mr. Rivlin said the Israeli public wanted a unity government including both Blue and White and Likud.
On paper, the Joint List's recommendation increases the chances that Mr. Rivlin will give Mr. Gantz the first crack at forming a government.
But analysts said the postelection imbroglio was far from resolved.
In deciding who is better placed to form a viable and stable coalition, Mr. Rivlin may take more than the basic numbers of recommendations into consideration, according to experts. In addition to Balad's non-endorsement, he could, for example, take into account the Joint List's broader refusal to join a Gantz-led government in weighing Mr. Gantz's prospects.
In any case, there are risks for both Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu in being the first to try to form a government, and analysts were already parsing the pros and cons of going first. Each might prefer their rival to try first and fail, in the hope that the second time around, it may be easier to persuade potential partners to cooperate in order to prevent a third election.
For Mr. Gantz, there could be an additional advantage in waiting: Mr. Netanyahu is facing a looming indictment in three corruption cases on accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and he could be charged in the coming weeks or months.

Two Ways to Spread a Message: A Protester and a Reporter Meet

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
September is turning out to be busy here at Team Climate. On Friday, we're expecting protests and strikes worldwide to protest climate change. They're timed to a week of climate events run in coordination with the United Nations. Then, on Saturday, youth delegates will convene in New York for a climate summit, and world leaders are scheduled to gather to discuss global warming on Monday. Those events will very likely draw protests and demonstrations, too.
All that comes after an, umm, lively start to the month. We've had no shortage of news, like the political storm over a presidential hurricane forecast. Then, there was the administration's plan to relax energy efficiency rules for light bulbs and its effort to revoke California's authority to set its own emissions standards. The president has been tweeting about that.
We're keeping an eye on it all, so stand by. Meanwhile, if you haven't already signed up for the newsletter, you can do it here. And, read on!

By now, you've probably seen ads for green energy companies. But how do you know if signing up will really reduce your carbon footprint?
The short answer: It will, but probably not the way you think.
That's because companies generally cannot send renewable energy directly to your home. Once electricity is in the grid, suppliers cannot distinguish the power produced by solar and wind farms from the power produced by fossil fuels, hydroelectric dams and nuclear plants.
To get around this problem, power companies came up with renewable energy certificates. Each certificate represents a given amount of electricity that's been generated from renewable sources. When energy companies produce that power, they get certificates they can sell to consumers.
So, when you sign up for green energy, you're really buying those renewable energy certificates.
"Short of having a solar array on your roof and keeping all those electrons to yourself, it'd be really hard to figure out what type of electrons you're using if you didn't have something like R.E.C.s to keep track of the math," said John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
If you live in a state with a deregulated energy system (most Northeastern states, California, Oregon and Texas) you can sign a supply deal with a renewable energy company. If you do, your provider will probably never mention the certificates behind the system. But, wherever the electrons really came from, all the energy you use will represent green power generation.
Those supply deals generally cost a bit more than a traditional utility bill. Prices vary, but the average household should expect to pay a few dollars more each month.
If you live in a state with a regulated energy system, you won't be able to choose your electricity provider. In that case you can still buy renewable energy certificates online to help encourage green power, but that would be separate from your utility service and bill.
Either way, the World Resources Institute, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Union of Concerned Scientists have said that certificates are a legitimate way to foster the growth of the renewable energy industry.
Mr. Rogers, the energy analyst, called them "totally legit."
Another thing you should keep in mind is that the market for certificates is unregulated. That means the government is not keeping an eye on producers to ensure that they deliver what they promise. There is an independent watchdog for green energy projects, though: Green-e.
Green-e does two important things: It verifies that the energy concerned actually does come from renewable sources, and it makes sure that the certificates are not double-counted. The E.P.A. recommends that consumers buy from companies with a Green-e certificate.
So, do your homework. And you can help encourage the transition to green energy.

Climate week is on its way, and you can expect to hear about a lot of protests, including the global student climate strike planned for Friday. Here at The Times, we're no strangers to protests, including the semiregular demonstrations around our building by Extinction Rebellion. The group is demanding quicker and more vigorous action on climate change, using protest and civil disobedience to spread its message.
That's how I first met Richard McLachlan; he was part of a protest back in the spring that involved student protesters and Extinction Rebellion.
When I saw that first demonstration from my office window -- it was in May, and related to the youth climate strike in Times Square -- I walked downstairs. In a world where people scream at each other anonymously on social media, I look for face-to-face conversation.
I asked several people, including Richard, why they were protesting at The Times. After all, we've got a team of about a dozen people whose whole job is covering climate change, and The Times covers the topic more thoroughly than just about any other publication. We ended up having a good conversation about what my colleagues and I do at the NYT.
Since then, Extinction Rebellion has returned to The Times on a number of occasions, including a shutdown of the street in front of our building in June that got some 70 people arrested.
One of the people who seems to always show up is Richard, a genial man from New Zealand who now lives in Brooklyn. Richard and I decided to get coffee together. He came to The Times one day in July. I got him through security -- the guards recognized him and were a little surprised to see me ushering him in. We went up to the 14th-floor lunchroom.
We talked about our grandchildren, and how we both worry about what the future will be for them. "It's giving me bad dreams," he told me.
One of his grandsons, he said, heard about the protesters getting arrested and that Richard was one of them. The boy said of his grandfather, "I'm a little bit proud of him."
Richard added, "I have to be able to look this kid in the eye in 10 years' time."
He's excited about a recent venture: speaking out on New York City subways about climate change and the need for action. You might think that New Yorkers would hate the intrusion into their day and their commute. It's a tough crowd, right?
But Richard told me that the response has been overwhelmingly positive; he even gets occasional applause. It helps that he's not asking for money, just giving out fliers. And he gives them out by the hundreds. It's his sincerity, it seems to me, that makes the subway soapbox moments work. "A homeless guy called me 'the new Noah' today," he said with a laugh.
We don't agree on everything. He wants The Times to adopt the prescriptive language of activists and use the terms "climate crisis" and "climate emergency." "I really believe that the urgency is not coming through," Richard said.
"At the moment, it feels that climate -- it's not even an emergency, man, it's a catastrophe! -- is one story among many" in Times coverage, he said.
I explained that we try to let the strength of our reporting underscore the urgency without using the language of advocacy, and that many of our readers are more persuaded by a sober statement of facts than an impassioned one. I said that I believe the reporting and prominent play The Times provides get that sense of urgency across. At the same time, I added, the longstanding view of the Times's editorial board is that climate change is a global crisis and requires intense and quick action.
I don't think I persuaded Richard. But we plan to keep talking. We both try to get the word out about climate change in our own way.

Hello again! One reader wrote to ask whether last week's One Thing item on a tax break for solar energy was an advertisement or an editorial. It was neither. The Times has a strict policy of keeping news separate from advertising and opinion, and Climate Fwd: is news. Hopefully, it's news you can use. That's the point of the One Thing column: to share ideas about how you can make a difference. Have a great week!

Texto completo: Headnote Wide receiver under investigation after rape accusation
The New England Patriots released Antonio Brown on Friday, ending his brief but turbulent tenure with the team as the NFL was investigating him for multiple accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, including rape. "The New England Patriots are releasing Antonio Brown," the team said in a statement. "We appreciate the hard work of many people over the past 11 days, but we feel that it is best to move in a different direction at this time."
On Thursday, Nike said it had terminated its contract with Brown. He also lost a contract with Xenith, the helmet manufacturer.
Cathy Lanier, the NFL's chief of security, was scheduled to meet Friday with a woman who said she endured unwelcome sexual advances from Antonio Brown two years ago. This week, the woman accused the wide receiver of sending her texts she found intimidating.
The meeting, according to Debra S. Katz, one of the woman's lawyers, was arranged "to ensure that my client's safety concerns are being addressed and to preserve electronic evidence." NFL officials also spoke with the woman's lawyers, Katz and Lisa J. Banks, on Friday morning.
The release capped a stormy period for one of the NFL's marquee franchises and Brown, who was accused of rape in a federal lawsuit filed by Britney Taylor last week. Taylor spoke with NFL officials earlier this week. Brown, who has denied the accusations from both women through his lawyer, posted about his release on social media, saying "Thank you for the opportunity" to the Patriots on Twitter. Brown's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said in a statement that it was "unfortunate things didn't work out with the Patriots" but that "Antonio is healthy and is looking forward to his next opportunity in the NFL."
The release came several hours after Patriots coach Bill Belichick abruptly ended a news conference after reporters asked multiple questions about Brown. He declined to answer them.
The text messages, first reported by Sports Illustrated, were sent Wednesday night by a number Brown used to initially communicate with the woman two years ago. They were sent to a group that included Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, and seemed to encourage a third party to research the woman's history. The texts included a photograph of her children.
Brown was instructed by the league and the Patriots to cease communicating with the woman, according to a statement from Katz and Banks.
"The NFL advised us that the Patriots directed Brown to have no further contact with our client, either directly or through his associates," they said. "The NFL also advised us that it contacted Mr. Brown's representative and reiterated that Mr. Brown was to cease and desist efforts to contact or intimidate our client."
The woman, an artist, had told Sports Illustrated this week that while she was working on a mural at Brown's house in 2017, he approached her from behind while naked, holding a hand towel over his genitals. She was later fired, she said.
In a letter sent to the NFL Thursday evening by the woman's lawyers, the artist also said Brown had sex with another woman while she was working on the mural in the same room.
Brown's tumult spanned three franchises and was marked by issues large and small - none as serious as the rape allegations.
He was sent from the Pittsburgh Steelers, where he played for nine years, seven of them as a Pro Bowler, to the Raiders in the offseason.
He then missed much of training camp with blistered feet, apparently caused by a cryogenic therapy chamber. Next came a dispute over his helmet, with Brown preferring a decade-old model that is no longer approved for use. He lost a grievance about the matter.
Unhappy, Brown was very active on social media throughout the Raiders' preseason, posting a letter from the team about his fines for missing practice as well as a phone conversation with his coach.
An altercation with his general manager, Mike Mayock, and a plea from Brown for his release, helped bring an end of his brief time with Oakland. The Patriots swooped in to acquire him as a free agent within hours.
In his debut for New England last Sunday, Brown caught four passes, including one for a touchdown, in a 43-0 win over the Dolphins. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The decision by The New York Times to remove a key exculpatory fact from its recent article on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is such an incredible editing error that it raises the prospect that it might have been an ideological intervention.
What editor, looking to cut down an article containing a new allegation of collegiate penis exposure, would happen to remove the detail that the female object of said exposure has told friends she has no memory of it? Any sentient editor would realize that the section containing this accusation would attract intense scrutiny. Nearly every other sentence in the piece was a more likely candidate for excision.
But why would an ideologically motivated editor remove a fact that is contained in the book (“The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation”) on which the article is based? This would be bias compounded by utter stupidity.
It has not helped that the Times responded to the controversy with all the transparency of an embezzling politician. At first, the Times said it was proud of the “well-reported and newsworthy” piece. Then the authors of the article (Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly) blamed their editors for the cut on national television. And that the whole thing was “just an oversight.” And that the sentence was removed because it contained the name of the supposed victim.
The last explanation assumes utter stupidity on the part of readers. If it is the policy of The New York Times not to reveal the names of possible sexual assault victims, why not just remove the name of the victim (who does not recall being a victim)? Why remove the whole sentence containing news about her not having any memory of the event?
Whether the result of bias or incompetence, this is journalistic malpractice of the first order. And its happiest critic is Donald Trump.
Whatever the initial plausibility of the case against Kavanaugh, it has grown weaker over time. The “previously unreported story” of exposure in the Times article is based on the accusations of one witness whom the authors did not interview and is disputed by the supposed victim herself. Support for Deborah Ramirez’s allegation of sexual exposure remains an unconvincing collection of partial memories and second-hand accounts.
And the reported portions of “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh” do little to make Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of attempted sexual assault more credible. Ford’s main character witness is her high school friend Leland Keyser. “We spoke multiple times to Keyser,” write Pogrebin and Kelly, “who also said that she didn’t recall that get-together or any others like it. In fact, she challenged Ford’s accuracy. ‘I don’t have any confidence in the story,’ she said.”
All of this leaves many of us in exactly the same place as before. We should take charges like these very seriously. But it should not be possible to destroy a person’s reputation on evidence so thin.
Why does the campaign to discredit Kavanaugh continue with such intensity? Some critics may be concerned about his views on campaign finance reform or the unitary executive. But the matter that provokes the most passion is abortion.
“When he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade,” Ford’s lawyer Debra Katz has said, “we will know who he is, we know his character, and we know what motivates him, and that is important: it is important that we know, and that is part of what motivated Christine.” The goal, it seems, is to preemptively discredit an unfavorable court decision by putting what Katz describes as “an asterisk” next to Kavanaugh’s name.
This strategy is one indicator of the unhealthy focus of our entire political system on Roe v. Wade. Because it touches on the deepest issues of autonomy and human dignity, the legal status of abortion is crucial. The problem comes when we see all politics through the lens of one issue.
Many on the right justify support for Trump because his corruption and dehumanization are less important than saving lives from abortion. But it is a theory without a limiting principle. It would justify voting for some pro-life politician who is a child molester. It would, quite literally, justify voting for a pro-life president who shot someone on Fifth Avenue.
Many on the left rationalize using Trump-like tactics against someone like Kavanaugh on the theory that preserving Roe justifies any means. If you can’t control the Supreme Court, trash it. Call the legitimacy of rulings by the court into question. The politics of personal destruction has merged with the politics of institutional destruction.
But not all roads lead to Roe. And opposing it, or preserving it, does not justify every method.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A whistleblower complaint and Democratic outrage over President Donald Trump's discussions with the Ukrainian president have sparked yet another inquiry into Trump's interactions with foreign leaders and has spilled over into the 2020 presidential campaign.
The story folds together diplomatic efforts from both the Obama and Trump administrations. Here we've attempted to breakdown what everyone is talking about.
First, it's important to know the players, who include familiar and some not-so-familiar names. They are: Trump, his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and current Ukrainian secretary general Yuriy Lutsenko.
At the heart of the matter are two developments that took place this summer: an August whistleblower complaint by a U. S. intelligence official and a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Zelensky. Democrats have demanded access to the whistleblower complaint and are seeking more information about the contacts with Ukraine, including those involving Trump and his personal lawyer, Giuliani.
A secret whistleblower complaint and a phone call
The whistleblower complaint remains shrouded in secrecy but The Washington Post and The New York Times have reported that at least part of it involved Ukraine.
Democrats want to know more about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic 2020 presidential candidate, and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma Group, an energy company in Ukraine. They contend that using the levers of diplomatic engagement to dig up dirt on a political rival is an abuse of power and raises questions about whether the president's actions amount to illegal soliciting of campaign assistance from a foreign country. The issue has further fueled growing Democratic pressure to impeach Trump.
On Sunday, Trump acknowledged bringing up Biden in a phone call with Zelensky but said the talk was appropriate.
"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption – all of the corruption taking place – and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine," Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas and Ohio.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that Trump asked Zelensky eight times to investigate Hunter Biden.
Hunter Biden in Ukraine
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, Shokin, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out.
But Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
Hunter Biden told the Times in May that he had "no role whatsoever" in the Ukrainian investigation of the company or any of its officers. The Post has reported there is "no evidence" Biden was trying to help his son.
Trump's call with Zelensky
On July 25, Trump called Zelensky, the Ukrainian president. Trump allegedly told Zelensky he could improve that country’s image by pursuing corruption cases, according to a letter from House Democrats investigating the call.
Trump also withheld more than $250 million in security assistance that Congress had appropriated and that Ukraine desperately needed. But the Trump administration made the funding available earlier this month.
Trump-Ukraine phone call: Trump acknowledges bringing up Joe Biden in phone call with Ukraine president
The day after Trump’s call, Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U. S. special representative for Ukraine, was dispatched to meet with Zelensky. And days later, Giuliani met in Spain with Andriy Yermak, a Zelensky aide, to discuss a possible meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
Giuliani has tweeted allegations of Biden corruption repeatedly, at one point alleging “bribery, extortion, money laundering and fraud” by the Biden family in China and Ukraine.
Biden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield told The New York Times in May that Biden acted "without any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen. ”
Standoff over the whistleblower complaint
Democrats are in a standoff with the Trump administration, which is refusing to turn over to Congress an Aug. 12 complaint from a whistleblower within the intelligence community. The conflict intensified after The Washington Post reported that the whistleblower had raised concerns over Trump’s contact with the foreign leader, including a "promise" he made to the leader.
The inspector general for the director of national intelligence (DNI), Michael Atkinson, said in a Sept. 9 letter that the matter involves an "urgent concern," which is defined as "a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, violation of the law," but "does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters. " Atkinson said a preliminary review found the complaint credible.
Such complaints are typically reported to Congress within seven days. But Atkinson said he hit an impasse with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, over sharing the complaint with Congress. Atkinson said he was told by the legal counsel for the intelligence director that the complaint did not meet the definition of an “urgent concern. ” And he said the Justice Department said it did not fall under the director’s jurisdiction because it didn't involve allegations concerning a member of the intelligence community or intelligence activity.
Atkinson said in a letter to Maguire he disagreed with that Justice Department opinion.
"I set forth my reasons for concluding that the subject matter involved in the complainant's disclosure not only falls within the DNI's jurisdiction, but relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people," Atkinson wrote.
The inspector general said he requested authorization to at the very least disclose the “general subject matter” to Congress but had not been allowed to do so. He said the information was “being kept” from Congress.
Biden: I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings
Democrats say they have "grave" concerns about the Trump administration's refusal to allow the complaint to be disclosed to members of Congress.
“Reports of a reliable whistleblower complaint regarding the President’s communications with a foreign leader raise grave, urgent concerns for our national security,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , said in a statement. “The president and acting DNI’s stonewalling must end immediately, and the whistleblower must be provided with every protection guaranteed by the law to defend the integrity of our government and ensure accountability and trust. ”
Giuliani admits he talked to Ukraine about Biden
Congressional Democrats said they were appalled by the efforts of Trump and Giuliani to get Ukraine to investigate Biden.
"If he demanded a foreign government do his political bidding, that’s when he crossed the critical threshold," Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn. , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote on Twitter.
The dispute had been simmering as Congress investigated what was said during the call. But it began to boil over last week when Giuliani gave an interview to CNN in which he first denied that he urged Ukraine to investigate and then acknowledged it.
“Of course I did,” Giuliani said during the rambling interview.
Giuliani said he visited Ukraine on his own and then told Trump.
“I did what I did on my own,” Giuliani said. “I told him about it afterward. ”
In reaction to Trump's acknowledgment that he talked about Biden in the call with Ukraine's president, Murphy tweeted: "If an American president gets away with bullying foreign counties to do his political bidding then we should just give up and accept our new banana republic. "
Three congressional chairmen – Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – had announced Sept. 9 that they were demanding records from the White House and State Department about alleged attempts to manipulate Ukraine’s judicial system.
“As the 2020 election draws closer, President Trump and his personal attorney appear to have increased pressure on the Ukrainian government and its justice system in service of President Trump’s reelection campaign, and the White House and the State Department may be abetting this scheme,” said the letter from the Democratic chairmen.
The State Department has insisted that President Trump’s attorney is “a private citizen” who “does not speak on behalf of the U. S. Government. ” Yermak publicly stated that “it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks. ”
The IG meets with the House Intelligence Committee
The inspector general met privately Thursday with members of the House Intelligence Committee. But Schiff, the committee chairman, said the official refused to describe the complaint, but called it “both credible and urgent. ”
The committee plans to hold a public hearing with Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, on Sept. 26. Maguire and Atkinson also are expected next week at the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Schiff said the prospect of misconduct at the highest levels of government "raises grave concerns that your office, together with the Department of Justice and possibly the White House, are engaged in an unlawful effort to protect the President and conceal from the Committee information related to his possible 'serious or flagrant' misconduct, abuse of power, or violation of law. "
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R. I. , tweeted that withholding the complaint could become another part of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation.
"This is deadly serious," Cicilline said. "If the President does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the Articles of Impeachment. "
Trump said the complaint was partisan, although he later said he didn’t know who made it.
"It’s a partisan whistleblower," Trump said.
Trump's response
Trump has said Biden should be investigated, but when speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump refused to describe his July call with the Ukrainian president and he dismissed the whistleblower complaint as a partisan attack.
"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case," Trump said. "It's a disgrace. " Trump has denied any impropriety in the call.
"I've had conversations with many leaders. They're always appropriate," Trump said last week. "It's just another political hack job. "
Biden's response
Biden lashed out Friday at Trump's effort to push Ukraine to investigate him.
"Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said during a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. . "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden then put out a statement Friday evening.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," the statement said. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Biden said on Saturday he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings overseas.
"Here’s what I know," he said. "Trump should be investigated. "

Texto completo: Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now as Springsteen turns 70 on Monday, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but area venues do have Boss-themed shows, including the Brian Kirk and the Jirk's-led "Born: Celebrating the Boss' 70th" at the Count Basie Center in Red Bank on Wednesday, Sept. 25, and Thursday, Sept. 26. Visit thebasie.org for more info and tickets.
"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, opens Sunday, Sept. 29, at the historical association in Freehold.
Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," said Springsteen to applause on Sept. 12 at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump will use his address before the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday to "affirm America's leadership role," while pressing for a "collective response" to challenges on the world stage, said a senior administration official, offering a broad preview of the president's remarks.
Trump will return to New York on Sunday night, and kick off three days of diplomatic events starting Monday, when he is scheduled to headline a forum on religious freedom, according to the White House.
On Tuesday, the president is slated to address the annual summit of world leaders, where he is also expected to hold a series of one-on-one discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday with his counterparts from Egypt, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Poland, New Zealand, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.
The gathering comes as Trump continues to navigate a number of foreign policy challenges, including escalating tensions with Iran, failed peace talks with the Taliban, and stalled denuclearization discussions with North Korea.
Asked what message he planned to deliver at the upcoming summit, Trump told reporters on Friday: "We have a big message for UNGA. We have a big message."
Some issues that foreign policy experts say are likely to generate the most attention include the following:
Discussions on Iran
In the wake of an airstrike on Saudi oil fields that the United States has blamed on Iran, Trump administration officials and top-ranking U.N. officials alike have said the General Assembly gathering could provide the venue to cool down tensions in the Persian Gulf.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, speaking to reporters at the UN's midtown Manhattan headquarters last Wednesday, said he was "absolutely sure" the Security Council, comprised of 15 member nations, would take up the issue of the attacks and the overall escalating tensions in the region.
"I don't think there is a more serious threat to peace and security in the world today than what's happening in the Gulf. This clearly is an area where I am absolutely sure the Security Council has a key role to play," Guterres said.
Iran has denied playing a role in the attacks, pointing to Yemen's Houthi rebel group, which has claimed responsibility for the strike. But Saudi officials and Trump administration officials contend the group, which is backed by Iran, could not execute such a high-level attack without assistance from Iran.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who met with Saudi leaders in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, days after the airstrike, told reporters he was "confident" that both the United States and Saudi Arabia would raise the issue of the strikes to the Security Council.
"We'd like a peaceful resolution, indeed, I think we've demonstrated that," Pompeo said.
Trump himself had floated the prospect of meeting one-on-one with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani in New York, but in the days leading up to the General Assembly, both sides backed away from the idea.
Officials in Tehran stated Iran would only engage in talks with nations that still belong to the Obama-era Iran Nuclear Deal, from which Trump withdrew last year, while Trump told reporters on Tuesday he would "prefer not" to meet with Rouhani on the sidelines of the UN summit.
Trump, who on Friday announced another wave of economic sanctions on Iran, told reporters he supported the idea of building a coalition with other allied nations to address Iran's latest provocations, before going on to tout the United States' nuclear capabilities.
"Well, I always like a coalition," Trump said. "So, we'll see what happens. Look, the United States is in a class by itself. We have the most powerful military in the world, by far. There's nobody close. As you know, we've spent tremendous and hopefully ... we pray to God we never have to use it, but we've totally renovated and bought new nuclear."
A senior administration official, speaking to reporters on Friday, emphasized the administration's push for a "collective response."
"We welcome this opportunity to consult with a broad range of partners and allies on our collective response," the official said. "It's important to remember the attack on the Saudi infrastructure is really an attack on everyone who consumes their energy."
Trump's 'bilat' with Ukraine
White House officials on Friday said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be among the handful of world leaders with whom Trump will hold bilateral talks while at the UN.
Trump's one-on-one talk with Zelensky comes as the president's discussions with the recently elected Ukrainian leader have come under scrutiny, amid news reports that the discussions were the source of a whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official last month who was reportedly concerned by the nature of the discussions.
The official who filed the complaint was alarmed by a "promise" Trump allegedly made to a foreign leader, according to a recent Washington Post report, citing officials familiar with the complaint. The Post and the New York Times have reported that the complaint involved Ukraine, but little else is known about the complaint, which the acting Director of National Intelligence has refused to release to Congress as required by law.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the complaint involved an alleged request by Trump for Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, with a Ukrainian gas company. The former vice president is the frontrunner among Democrats looking to challenge Trump in next year's election.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) has threatened to sue to force the release of the documents, and has argued the Trump administration's decision not to release the complaint to lawmakers is "unprecedented."
Asked about Trump's agenda for the meeting with Zelensky, a senior administration official said Friday that the president "is going to focus on again congratulating President Zelensky on his election victory and the incredible energy and success that Zelensky has put forward in implementing reform and anti-corruption efforts."
Trump's new hires
Trump's arrival at the UN summit comes days after his newly appointed UN Ambassador Kelly Knight Craft officially assumed her role, and days after Trump named former hostage negotiator Robert C. O'Brien his new national security adviser.
Craft, who previously served as Trump's ambassador to Canada, was tapped to replace former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who stepped down last fall. Foreign policy experts note that Craft will likely not enjoy the same level of influence on U.S. foreign policy as Haley, who held the ambassador's post as a Cabinet-level position. Trump has since restructured the position so it no longer belongs to his Cabinet.
Senate Democrats previously raised concerns about Craft's lack of diplomatic experience during her Senate confirmation hearings, but the former Kentucky businesswoman and deep-pocketed Republican campaign donor repeatedly defended her credentials, saying her business acumen would prove an asset in the position.
Speaking to reporters at the UN on Wednesday, Craft said: "In a world marked by humanitarian crises and geopolitical challenges, strong American leadership is absolutely critical, and I intend to provide it."
Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said O'Brien, a seasoned diplomat who once was tapped to be a part of the U.S. delegation to the General Assembly in 2005, would bring a level of experience that could help Trump hold "a more constructive attitude toward the UN."
Since taking office, the president has pulled the United States out of the UN's human rights council and withdrew the United States from the UN's arms treaty.
"There are so many significant issues on the UN agenda this year ... predicting what the Trump administration will do, however, is impossible given the president's leadership style and a new ambassador with little experience," O'Connell said.

JUST A QUICK REMINDER ABOUT TAKING YOUR GATOR TO THE AIRPORT

Texto completo: Alas, no pattern emerged this summer that could assist the authorities in predicting the location of the next Pittsburgh incident, so now it's pretty much a cold case because nobody's seen an alligator around here in more than two months.
Though it somehow commanded the attention of both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, two outlets that rarely agree on what is even an allegorical alligator and what is not, it appears our abbreviated reign as what somebody called the City of Chompions has ended without incident and with even less explanation.
That's partially why I'm heading to the airport.
Yeah, stay with me on this.
I didn't get to see any of Pittsburgh's four alligators - the one near the South Side Giant Eagle in May, the 5-footer in Beechview in June, the Carrick porch dweller a few days later or the one found loitering in a Shaler parking lot in mid-July.
Both Gator 1 and Gator 4 were apprehended within hissing distance of a Giant Eagle, but I wouldn't read anything into that. Even if boneless chicken breasts were on sale at some point during the relevant time frame, they don't stay on sale for two months.
Gator 4 was judged by authorities to be the least threatening, even though it still managed to generate one of the Great Moments in Pittsburgh-area Law Enforcement, when Shaler Police took the little guy's picture - he was a 2-footer - and posted it on Facebook above a caption that began, "If this is your alligator ... "
The only Pittsburgh gator with the potential for real menace was Chomp, the Beechview creature that left through a window after his owner let him out of a basement enclosure to clean it. Apparently the scores of other animals on the premises - having never been witness to a live alligator defenestration - were too awestruck to persuade Chomp to stay.
With noted reluctance (hissing and slithering), Chomp surrendered to authorities about 90 feet down the sidewalk, and I'm guessing that's about as theatrical as Pittsburgh's gator mania will ever get.
Unless I get lucky at an airport this weekend.
According to an email I received last week from the ever-informative Transportation Safety Administration, I'm almost as likely to see an alligator at a security checkpoint as anywhere else in the city.
Generally, the TSA does a fine job of screening things you shouldn't be carrying onto an airplane, but they do an even better job of counting them and cataloging unusual items. Because I'm flying coast-to-coast this weekend, I reminded myself to check their most recent stats.
Between Aug. 26 and Sept. 15, for example, the TSA found 253 guns in carry-on luggage nationally, 225 of them loaded, with 84 having a bullet in the chamber.
This is an improvement.
August brought only 329 guns to the TSA's attention at security checkpoints, down 13% from August 2018. At this rate, the likelihood that I'll be sitting next to someone who tried to bring a gun on the plane will be virtually nonexistent by the time I'm too old to fly anyway.
The TSA also reminds us that attempting to carry a gun aboard in carry-on baggage can result in a fine of $13,333 or an arrest. Further, that TSA-Pre status you're always bragging about, well you can kiss that goodbye. Honest to God, it says that on the website.
This probably came about from so many people saying, "What, no TSA-Pre? I've got to take my shoes off now? That's it. Where's my gun?"
Anyway, last week's TSA Week in Review hit my email with this teaser: "An Alligator?"
Apparently, at Shreveport (La.) Regional Airport, an X-ray screener spotted what appeared to be an alligator's head next to a grenade in someone's bag. That, of course, shut the line down temporarily while the screener - just to be safe, obviously - opened that particular carry-on to see what could possibly look like an alligator's head next to a grenade.
Turned out it was just an alligator's head next to a grenade.
Which, it turns out, is half legal.
The head of a deceased and/or taxidermy-treated alligator is legal in carry-on baggage, although the TSA recommends you check with your airline anyway.
By contrast, grenades - inert grenades, empty grenades, faux grenades, replica grenades - are never allowed. No grenades, people. We shouldn't have to tell you this.
Alligators, particularly parts of dead ones, are not grenades in the eyes of the TSA.
I'm not going to argue that any part of any alligator, living or dead, should have grenade status when it comes to air travel (including alligator bags), because it's just not worth it. I just don't want to sit next to someone who is traveling with a comfort gator.

Texto completo: As you read this, I’m away on vacation — unless you’re one of those people who let their newspapers stack up, that is. In that case, I might already be back. For the rest of you, look for me again Oct. 2.
Speaking of papers, many of you offered comments online and via email on my Sept. 1 column on the cessation of newspaper sales at Starbucks.
Not surprisingly, many of you enjoy newspapers, especially the printed version.
“I still get the local paper and read it every day. Online isn’t the same,” said Leah Leander Fuller.
“I like an actual paper copy! Especially because I love doing the New York Times crossword puzzle,” Rose Davidson said. “Just no fun to look at it online.”
“I still like spreading the physical newspaper out on my kitchen counter, double pager. It is my solace before a hectic day,” Laura Turnbull shared.
“I just do not want to depend on internet news. I will mourn the day when print dies,” said John Kolody.
“I like a physical newspaper also. Currently get the New York and LA Times along with the Daily Bulletin of course,” says John Fatini. (I like his “of course.”) Fatini continues: “After finishing I take all three to the Chino Senior Center where they are appreciated seven days a week.”
Now that’s an interesting idea. You could drop off your newspaper to a senior center or other place where people might like it. That is, if you haven’t already completed the crossword. They hate that.
Often I leave my morning Daily Bulletin behind at a bakery or coffeehouse if I’m out. Someone might pick it up and be intrigued.
My colleague Ryan Hagen was at a car dealership in San Bernardino the other day when he spotted a copy of that morning’s Sun. The sight “inspired a mother in the waiting room to explain to her roughly 5-year-old daughter what a newspaper is,” Hagen said. “The daughter seems like a fan!”
Get ’em while they’re young.
It’s not just Starbucks that isn’t carrying newspapers anymore, or Barnes & Noble, which stopped a year or so ago. “My Bristol Farms, and I suspect of all them, no longer stock papers,” wrote retired newsman Van Gordon Sauter.
Susan Strother Carrier said she may fight back against the Starbucks decision in her own way.
“I have the Sunday NY Times delivered. When I’m finished reading it,” she said, “I think I’ll start dropping it off at my local Pomona Starbucks.” That’s the spirit.
Karen Karlsson puts a digital spin on the whole thing: “I read my digital subscription to the NY Times (and the IV Daily Bulletin) on my laptop in Starbucks!” Hey, Starbucks has free wifi, so why not?
Let me add, I’m agnostic on print versus digital, enjoying both. Basically I just want to stay employed. Get whichever one appeals to you.
“I miss reading a physical copy of the newspaper, but I am, as of today, the proud owner of an IVDB online subscription!” Judi Holsten Guizado said a couple of weeks back. I hope it will serve her in good stead.
“While physical newspaper sales are diminishing quickly, there will always be a need and desire for great content and stories,” says Joshua Swodeck, who supports us online.
In fact, when someone groused to him recently about how we at the Bulletin have the nerve to want people to pay for our product, Swodeck pulled out a dollar bill — our trial subscriptions online are 99 cents for 13 weeks — and offered it up. (It wasn’t accepted.)
Some ex-readers are disaffected by a perceived political bias in their former newspaper of choice. Randie Kreutzer canceled the L.A. Times after 30 years but said: “I really miss reading the news in print and I do get the San Gabriel Valley Tribune delivered on Sunday as a concession to my need to stay informed. Otherwise, you can count me as one reader who doesn’t miss buying a paper.”
Regarding my quest for a New York Times, newspaper carrier Ray Bernal suggested home delivery of the Times or the Post. He added that “throwing one of those NYT Sunday editions” is “like a shot put.”
I could subscribe, but I already read four papers, including my own, and don’t have the time or dough for a daily Big Apple paper too. Plus, I can read the Times at a library if I need to, albeit not over a beverage.
When the paper became unavailable at Starbucks, though, I did get a sudden craving for what was out of reach. As I wrote here, I found a nearly week-old NYT Sunday edition at Ontario’s Newsboy Books and ponied up $6 plus tax, figuring there would still be plenty of interest. And there was.
I read how “Sesame Street” has used music in its 50 years, with the singer-songwriter Leslie Feist talking about how her “1234” song became her signature tune after the show used it. I read an interview with actor Tom Hiddleston and articles about use of the term “gaslighting” and about the history of nighttime tennis in the U.S. Open. I chuckled at learning the term “hicksters,” which refers to hipsters who live in the sticks.
Two weeks after I bought the paper, I finished it off last weekend by reading its magazine profile of Neil Young. I would say I more than got my $6 worth.
The Starbucks move seemed to have a ripple effect on the NYT’s local availability. Newsboy co-owner Jack Gingold called distribution “problematic” but said the store, which is closed Sundays, gets the Sunday bulldog edition by 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
I’ll have to pick up one again. Or see if Susan Carrier has left it behind at a Pomona Starbucks.

Texto completo: CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA – Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused President Trump of "abhorrent" behavior amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.
Biden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," Biden said in a statement Friday evening. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Asked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa . . . wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues. "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line that he found it "concerning to me that a president would do something like that. "
“It’s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,” Biden said in the interview. “I’ve never heard of it before. I’ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should. ”
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that Biden, as vice president, had pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.
"At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress," Biden said.
Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"
Earlier Friday, Trump called reports of the whistleblower complaint against him a “ridiculous story” and said his communications with other leaders were “at the highest level always appropriate. ” Asked by reporters Friday if he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden. ”
He said it "doesn't matter" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and that it should be done anyway.
Trump again attacked Biden in a Tweet on Saturday morning. He said his conversation with Zelensky was "perfectly fine and routine. " He added that, "nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. "
Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president "sober and serious stuff. "
"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,” Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. “This is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct. ”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter that Congress' failure to impeach Trump following the release earlier this year of the Mueller report made it “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. ”
“Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” Warren added. “A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right. ”

Texto completo: A mother tries to free her daughter from Keith Raniere's group, and a Netflix documentary examines the humanitarian efforts of the co-founder of Microsoft.
What's on TV
ESCAPING THE NXIVM CULT: A MOTHER'S FIGHT TO SAVE HER DAUGHTER 8 p.m. on Lifetime. This June, Keith Raniere, the leader of an organization known as Nxivm, was convicted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges, ending a trial that exposed the secretive group's inner workings. Nxivm presented itself as a personal fulfillment program, but some of its female members say they were recruited into a secret society within the group, known as D.O.S., where they were branded, threatened with blackmail and assigned to have sex with Raniere. It's no wonder, then, that the operations of the enclave, which prosecutors likened to that of a "horror movie," serve as the inspiration for this made-for-TV film. Based on the tell-all memoir "Captive," by the actress Catherine Oxenberg, the film follows Oxenberg's struggle to free her daughter, India, from the group's secret society. Peter Facinelli plays the enigmatic Nxvim leader, and Sara Fletcher plays Allison Mack, the "Smallville" actress who pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy related to her involvement in the group.
DRUNK PARENTS 8 p.m. on Starz. Alec Baldwin, Salma Hayek and Jim Gaffigan star in this comedy that follows the misadventures of an upper-class couple after they realize that they're actually broke. To keep their daughter enrolled at her private university, Frank (Baldwin) and Nancy (Hayek) scramble to make some extra money through a network of half-baked neighborhood schemes, like renting out their wealthy neighbor's mansion while he's out of the country.
What's Streaming
INSIDE BILL'S BRAIN: DECODING BILL GATES Stream on Netflix. Over his lifetime, the 63-year-old Microsoft co-founder has been branded a genius, a ruthless businessman and a generous philanthropist. This three-part documentary looks at the way those roles have influenced Gates's humanitarian work with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, like trying to improve sanitation or eradicate polio across the globe. The film, directed by Davis Guggenheim ("An Inconvenient Truth"), looks back at Gates's childhood in Seattle, the founding of Microsoft and his antitrust battle against the government in 1998, juxtaposing those personal triumphs and challenges with his efforts to improve the world's problems using his singular mind.
THIS CLOSE Stream on AMC Premiere. Following its Friday night finale, you can catch up on the entire second season of this groundbreaking series online. The deaf writing partners Shoshannah Stern and Josh Feldman star in this comedy as Kate and Michael, best friends trying to navigate Los Angeles, career ambitions and relationships, who also just happen to be deaf. "We don't want to feel we have to educate people or represent our community well," Feldman said in an interview with The New York Times. "We just want to tell a story about two people who are deaf." In the final two episodes, Michael confronts his substance abuse issues and family trauma at rehab, and Kate and Michael re-evaluate their codependent friendship after Kate moves into her own place.

Trump on the defensive over whistleblower; Democrats demand details amid word of improper discussions with a foreign leader and targeting of Biden.

Texto completo: Correction: Whistleblower complaint: In the Sept. 21 Section A, an article about a whistleblower complaint against President Trump said Ukraine has been battling Russian-based separatists occupying Crimea. The fighters are Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.
President Trump appeared on the brink of a new scandal Friday over a whistleblower's complaint that reportedly involves Ukraine and accuses Trump of making an improper promise to a foreign leader over the summer.
The controversy has refocused attention on Trump's attempts to undercut former Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading polls for next year's Democratic presidential nomination, by urging Ukrainian officials to investigate son Hunter Biden's business dealings there for possible corruption.
Trump tried to dismiss mounting concerns by calling the complaint "just another political hack job" and describing the whistleblower as "a partisan person" despite admitting he doesn't know who it is. He insisted his conversations with world leaders are "always appropriate."

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Trump refused to say whether he mentioned Biden in a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying "it doesn't matter" what they discussed.
But Trump, who is scheduled to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week, said that "somebody ought to look into Joe Biden," though he complained no one would "because he's a Democrat."
The Wall Street Journal reported that during their phone call, Trump had repeatedly urged Zelensky to help investigate Biden's son Hunter. The Washington Post and the New York Times had previously reported that the whistleblower complaint involves Ukraine and Trump's communications with a foreign leader, but much of the situation remains murky because the whistleblower's identity and the specifics of the complaint remain under wraps.
The former vice president has denied any wrongdoing.
"Not one single credible outlet has given any credibility to [Trump's] assertions," Biden said after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "I have no comment, except the president should start to be president."
The whistleblower complaint was filed on Aug. 12 with the intelligence community's inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who notified the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 9 because he considered the complaint "urgent" and "credible."
Atkinson, a former federal prosecutor who was appointed to his current position by Trump, stressed the urgency of the matter in a second letter on Sept. 17, saying it "relates to one of the most significant and important of the [director of national intelligence's] responsibilities to the American people."
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), the committee chairman, has fought to obtain a copy of the complaint. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has refused to release it.
The top lawyer for Maguire's office wrote in a letter to Schiff that the complaint "concerned conduct by someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to any 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision," meaning there was no requirement to provide it to Congress.
Democrats say Maguire is violating the law, which his office denies. The dispute is likely to become a new front in the legal battles between House Democrats and the White House.
Presidents have wide latitude to deal with foreign leaders and disclose classified information, so it wasn't immediately clear why Trump's conduct triggered an intelligence officer's complaint to the inspector general. Schiff said there's no reason to believe the whistleblower merely disagreed with Trump's policies.
"This involves something more sinister, something involving a serious or flagrant abuse or violation of law or misappropriation," he said Friday.
Maguire is scheduled to testify publicly on Capitol Hill next Thursday.
Democratic leaders rallied around Schiff's efforts. The dispute raises "grave, urgent concerns for our national security," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said in a statement. If Trump "has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy" she added. Trump has made no secret of wanting Ukrainian authorities to investigate Biden, an effort that could boost his reelection effort, much as he demanded U.S. authorities investigate his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.
"He's a guy who has no boundaries," said Anthony Scaramucci, who was briefly Trump's communications director and has since become an outspoken critic. "He'll do and say anything if he thinks it will help him."
The president's personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, has publicly urged Ukraine's prosecutors to reopen an investigation involving Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company where Hunter Biden was a board member.
The company was scrutinized by a top Ukrainian prosecutor several years ago, but the Obama administration wanted him ousted as part of a crackdown on corruption in Kyiv. Biden, then the vice president, threatened to withhold a $1-billion loan guarantee to Ukraine if the prosecutor wasn't sacked, and he was pushed out in March 2016.
No available evidence indicates that Biden's demand was linked to his son, a Los Angeles resident who has not faced any accusations of wrongdoing for his role at Burisma. It's unclear whether the investigation into the energy company was active when the prosecutor was pushed out.
Giuliani's efforts to spark a new investigation in Ukraine reflects Trump's fixation on a potential campaign match-up with Biden, whom he's watched carefully in the run-up to next year's primary season. The president has regularly asked allies and friends how he could attack the former vice president and how he might fare in that fight.
Taras Berezovets, who heads the Kyiv-based political consulting firm Berta Communications, said "it is not news here" that Trump wants the Burisma investigation reopened.
"If Zelensky goes ahead and does it, that will be strategically ruinous for the relations between our countries," he said. "That would be direct meddling in U.S. internal affairs."
There are suspicions that the dispute may be tied to U.S. military assistance for Ukraine, which has been battling Russian-based separatists occupying Crimea. The White House delayed providing $250 million worth of aid authorized by Congress, finally releasing it this month.
"When I was in Ukraine in early September, Ukrainian officials fretted that U.S. military assistance -- then on hold at the request of the White House -- was being held hostage to earlier Giuliani requests for dirt on Hunter Biden," said Jeffrey Feltman, a former United Nations undersecretary-general for political affairs.
There was a sense of deja vu in Washington over the latest White House mystery, which erupted five months after former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III released his report on the Russia investigation.
That case also revolved, in part, around Ukraine. Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for tax evasion, bank fraud and other crimes related to his work as a political consultant for the country's pro-Russian government, which has since lost power.
Mueller ultimately did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Moscow's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. Although Mueller laid out ways the president tried to block the investigation, Atty. Gen. William Barr and Deputy Atty. Gen. Rod Rosenstein concluded that Trump did not obstruct justice.
House Democrats have been slow to advance their own investigations since then, and Pelosi has avoided backing impeachment hearings, saying Congress would need overwhelming evidence and bipartisan support before trying to oust the president.
But now Trump faces the prospect of an entirely new scandal, complete with the drip-drip of leaks and mushrooming speculation about misconduct in office.
"It could be a whopping big deal if the president of the United States was using American governmental power to get a foreign power to help do his bidding in exchange for aid or other concessions from the U.S. -- that would be absolutely lawless," said Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), who already supports an impeachment inquiry over the Russia investigation.

Texto completo: Few big donors could pass a purity test
I've read with great interest your multiple articles on Jeffrey Epstein's ties to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, now, Harvard (“MIT, Harvard reveal more Epstein ties," Page A1, Sept. 13). In the late 1960s, a landlord, Maurice Gordon, was set to donate millions of dollars to the Boston University School of Nursing, where I was a student. Protests arose, and the donation was rejected. Subsequently, the School of Nursing closed.
Big money is hard to come by for universities, cultural institutions, hospitals, and other nonprofits.
Yes, there are a few squeaky-clean billionaires, but how many? If these esteemed institutions start rejecting money made by crooks, robber barons, and other unsavory sources, they might as well close their doors. There are very few names on our Boston institutions whose money was made without sin.
Let's stop being self-righteous, and let the sinners repent with the money they earned with their nefarious deeds. Redemption has many paths.

Institutions face challenges as federal funding shrinks
The way in which MIT handled Jeffrey Epstein is deplorable (“MIT female faculty confront president," Page A1, Sept. 19). It is also a reflection of a deeper problem in science. As federal funding has tightened, scientific institutions have turned increasingly to wealthy donors. While most donors are decent and well-meaning, many of them are attracted by science that is glitzy or serves a political goal. As competition for their largesse has become keener, it is easy for scientific institutions to lose sight of their mission and standards.

Epstein scandal is of a piece with MIT's Saudi partnerships
Earlier this year, MIT did some soul-searching about the funding it obtains from Saudi Arabia, and produced the Lester report on the issue. On Feb. 6, president L. Rafael Reif wrote a letter to the MIT community, saying, in part, that the Lester report “explores the full range of competing factors to consider, including faculty autonomy, the social and scientific value of the work we undertake with Saudi people and entities, the challenge of working in a nation so out of step with our commitment to inclusion and free expression, and our community's deep sense of revulsion at actions of the Saudi regime.
“Ultimately, the report concludes that if MIT faculty wish to continue their current engagements with colleagues, students, and public and private research sponsors in Saudi Arabia, they should be free to do so, as long as these projects remain consistent with MIT policies and procedures and US laws and regulations."
Reif wrote, “I agree with these recommendations."
MIT senior leadership's apparent decision to allow the Media Lab to accept donations from Jeffrey Epstein, albeit under some conditions aimed at reducing the benefit Epstein would obtain from his association with MIT, should not come as a surprise in light of the principles articulated in Reif's Feb. 6 letter.

Serial abusers have been enabled in a range of sectors
The Globe's revelations about MIT's quietly cozy relationship with Jeffrey Epstein (“At MIT, an Epstein gift brings regret, soul searching," front page, Sept. 14), and the new book “She Said" by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, showcase a network of enablers disguised as lawyers, lab directors, consultants, and business partners. This enabler class deemed laboratory supplies, or movie scripts, more valuable than lives shattered by sexual violence.
Everyday Americans become enablers when they cheer an NFL team whose gifted running back beats his fiancee. Tribal politics asks voters to support their party's candidates and chosen judges, even when credible allegations of predatory behavior and sexual misconduct surface.
When profits, academic research, or political advantage matters more than a woman's humanity, society learns to tolerate and protect the sexual aggression of prominent men. As long as we allow abusers to shine among us, or as long as we provide them with cover, violence against women will remain a sickening staple of American life.

Must Epstein be known, on first reference, for his finances?
In the ongoing coverage about Jeffrey Epstein and his secret donations, I think it is appropriate that the Globe replace the first phrase usually used to describe Epstein, “disgraced financier," with “convicted sex offender."
Articles often cite that he was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution, but let's call that what it actually is — the sexual abuse of someone's child. If anyone is disgraced now, it's Harvard, MIT, and the individuals who accepted money from this convicted sex offender.

Texto completo: Headnote From the Editors ofE - The Environmental Magazine
Dear EarthTalk: What is the so-called Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and is Congress likely to go for it? - Mark Talarico, Brooklyn, N.Y.
The concept of a "Green New Deal" (GND), first called for in a 2007 New York Times op-ed by Thomas Friedman, has been in the news lately, thanks to a protest outside of Nancy Pelosi's office in mid-November a week after the 2018 mid-term elections when Democrats took back the House.
The goal of the GND is to put America at the forefront of green technologies to meet or exceed our Paris climate treaty commitments while boosting the economy and reducing economic inequality.
Think of it as like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's original "New Deal" that helped get Americans back on their feet economically after the Great Depression through the creation of millions of federally-funded jobs that not only employed people but boosted U.S. economic productivity.
The GND aims to give Americans a leg up in profiting off the transition to greener energy sources while simultaneously reducing the divide between the haves and have-nots.
At that November protest, hundreds of activists affiliated with the so-called Sunrise Movement showed up to call on Pelosi to back omnibus economic stimulus legislation that would put millions of Americans to work on facilitating the transition to an economy powered by 100 percent renewable, emissions-free energy.
Later that day incoming Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez showed her support by proposing the creation of a new House Select Committee on a Green New Deal tasked with detailing a "national, industrial, economic mobilization plan capable of making the U.S. economy 'carbon neutral' while promoting 'economic and environmental justice and equality'."
"There are so many different progressive issues that are important, and climate change and addressing renewable energy always gets to the bottom of the barrel," Ocasio-Cortez told The Intercept.
"That can gets kicked from session to session and so what this just needs to do is create a momentum and an energy to make sure that that it becomes a priority for leadership."
At least 45 House members have expressed support for the GND, while eight Democratic presidential candidates (including Jay Inslee, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Ber-nie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren) are also behind it.
And with the majority of Americans favoring taking strong action against climate change even if it means higher taxes, implementing some of kind of GND seems like a no-brainer.
But environmentalists might not want to hold their breath. For starters, Ocasio-Cortez's proposal for the creation of a new House Select Committee on a Green New Deal won't be ready for a full House vote until 2020. Also, just because 40 members of Congress are supportive now doesn't say anything about where the other 395 Con-gresspersons stand, let alone the 100 members of the still-Republican-controlled Senate.
Meanwhile, conservative critics point out that a Green New Deal could actually hurt the economy more than help it, given how reliant we are on abundant and cheap fossil fuels. Even some liberals worry that the GND is trying to bite off more than we can chew.
Only time will tell if something like the GND will become the law of the land - and many "greens" are keeping their fingers crossed.

Ganging up: Kavanaugh faces 2 more critical media books, from Wash Post, LA Times

Texto completo: The publishing industry is bracing for a public push back on pending investigative books about Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh after the New York Times fumbled its debut of theirs.
“The epic bomb of the NYT Kavanaugh book will hit the two remaining Kavanaugh ‘take downs,’” said a Washington book agent. Those books are coming from Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus and Los Angeles Times Washington Editor Jackie Calmes.
While the sales numbers won’t be out for a week, the Times book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, has stumbled and may not even make it on to the Times' best-seller list. It ranks 690th on Amazon, a 200-point drop in just one day.
In total, Kavanaugh is the subject of at least 10 finished or pending books.
Reporters who covered the Kavanaugh Senate confirmation hearings said that the Times book was newsy, but the paper mishandled the debut in the paper by leaving out key details of an alleged sexual assault by Kavanaugh the the victim didn’t remember.
Ryan Lovelace, who recently released his book on the hearings, Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign against Brett Kavanaugh, said the Times book could undermine the public’s trust in journalists and the court.
“The newest rumors against Justice Kavanaugh traded up the chain of the press just the same way that last year’s sexual misconduct allegations did. This is how nonsense becomes nightly news — through a compliant press, activist lawyers, and ambitious politicians with ulterior motives,” he said in an interview.
What’s more, he added, “The legitimacy and authority of the Supreme Court is under attack and the public’s confidence in the judiciary is what’s at stake now.”

Environmental apocalypse predictions have failed for half a century

Texto completo: Climate change activism is warming up this week with climate strikes, a U.N. summit, plus extra media coverage. Naturally, the apocalyptic rhetoric is warming up, too. To take only two examples among many: “2020 could be your last chance to stop an apocalypse,” warned a Los Angeles Times editorial last Sunday. What's more, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to criticism that her Green New Deal is unrealistic by saying, “What’s not realistic is Miami not existing in a few years.”
Before anyone is tempted to start believing any of these predictions, it’s worth recalling that similar predictions of impending environmental doom have been made regularly for the past half-century. They have been made by leading scientific experts as well as journalists and politicians.
Although the cause of looming disaster has changed over the decades, one thing hasn’t changed: Every prediction with a date attached has not happened. Most have been spectacularly wrong. Here are a few examples.
Young Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich, who became famous with publication of The Population Bomb in 1968, regularly predicted global mass starvation by the 1970s and 1980s because of overpopulation and resource depletion. In 1970, Ehrlich predicted that the oceans would be dead in less than a decade, that Americans would face water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980.
Ehrlich, by the way, is older but not wiser. He’s still making similar predictions with the dates changed to a few years into the future.
The next wave of doommongers focused on global cooling and the next ice age. The Guardian reported in January 1974, “Space satellites show new Ice Age coming fast.” Time got around to reporting the same news in July the same year. In 1976, the New York Times reviewed a book by young climate scientist Stephen Schneider about how to prepare for lower food production caused by global cooling. Some years later Schneider became a leading advocate of global warming alarmism.
Cooling was so '70s. By the late 1980s all the really cool people were predicting imminent catastrophes caused by global warming. James Hansen of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies beginning in 1988 predicted major droughts and up to six feet of sea level rise in the 1990s. One reporter recalled that in the late 1980s, he asked Hansen in his Manhattan office whether anything in the window would look different in 20 years. Hansen replied, “The West Side Highway [which runs along the Hudson River] will be under water. And there will be tape across the windows across the street because of high winds.”
The doommongers have made countless predictions of imminent climate catastrophes in the three decades since Hansen’s debut. Let’s focus on just one: the melting Arctic Ocean icecap.
Al Gore predicted in 2009 that the North Pole would be completely ice free in five years. A U.S. Navy scientist in 2013 concluded that the Arctic’s summer sea ice cover would all be melted by 2016.
Bogus predictions confidently made are not always harmless. The Maritime Bulletin reported that on Sept. 3, 16 “climate change warriors” making a documentary film on the melting polar icecap had to be rescued by helicopter from their ship because it was stuck in the ice halfway between Norway and the North Pole.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute has compiled copies of news clips of these wrong predictions and many more. Most of them are hilarious in hindsight, but they raise a serious question.
After 50 years of misinformed, misguided, and mistaken predictions, is there any reason to believe that the current prophecies of global warming apocalypse are likely to come true?

Glaciologist Erin Pettit began a research project to find out what calving glacier ice sounded like to a humpback whale. The sound of the ice in the water turned out to be more interesting. Acoustic research in Alaska’s Icy Bay and other glacier ice-filled waters found that the fizz created by the release of air bubbles under high pressure makes fjords with glacier icebergs the noisiest places in the ocean.

Texto completo: CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA – Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused President Trump of "abhorrent" behavior amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.
Biden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," Biden said in a statement Friday evening. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Asked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa . . . wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues. "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line that he found it "concerning to me that a president would do something like that. "
“It’s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,” Biden said in the interview. “I’ve never heard of it before. I’ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should. ”
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that Biden, as vice president, had pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.
"At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress," Biden said.
Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"
Earlier Friday, Trump called reports of the whistleblower complaint against him a “ridiculous story” and said his communications with other leaders were “at the highest level always appropriate. ” Asked by reporters Friday if he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden. ”
He said it "doesn't matter" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and that it should be done anyway.
Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris came to Biden's defense and hammered Trump over reports that he sought foreign help to go after a political rival.
“He has openly invited interference," the California senator told reporters prior to a speech in Waterloo, Iowa. "And now we have information that suggests that, again, he has engaged in that kind of behavior. What he fails to understand is that he is the president of the United States, and that the office of the president of the United States is the people’s office — not his office. And he may be afraid of a candidate in this election. "
"Well then win on merit, but leave Joe Biden alone in terms of being in cahoots and collaborating with a foreign government to attack our democracy," Harris said. "That’s what this is about. It's really basic. Donald Trump appears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America’s democracy. ”
Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president "sober and serious stuff. "
"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,” Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. “This is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct. ”

Texto completo: Three volcano monitoring stations are scheduled to be installed on Mount Hood next week in what the U.S. Geological Survey says will be a big step for protecting lives and property.
Seth Moran, scientist-in-charge at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, said the three early-detection and monitoring stations will have seismometers, used to measure earthquakes, and GPS receivers, used to detect surface deformation.
“If the ground starts moving, when magma is moving, it can deform the surface, Moran said. “This will really give us capacity to detect ground deformation associated with unrest.”
The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the Cascades, provides an example of how monitoring can foretell a coming eruption.
In March 1980, a series of earthquakes offered scientists the first clues that Mount St. Helens was waking, 123 years after its last major eruption in 1857.
In the days leading up to the cataclysmic eruption on May 18, 1980, a bulge on the volcano's north side was growing by an astonishing 5 feet a day from magma moving and building below the surface.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, Mount Hood has erupted repeatedly over millenniums, with its most recent eruptions occurring from 1781 to 1793.
The mountain is an active volcano that produces frequent earthquakes and earthquake swarms. Steam and volcanic gases are emitted around Crater Rock near the mountain's summit.
Mount Hood has been classified as a “very high threat volcano,” in part because of its proximity to nearby communities.
Helicopter delivery
The early-detection and monitoring stations will be placed above Mount Hood's treeline on the volcano's west, north and east flanks. A volcanic gas monitoring station will be installed later.
A helicopter will be used to deliver equipment to the monitoring sites. About 15 employees from the Cascades Volcano Observatory will trek to the sites on foot to install the equipment.
Moran said it could take two full days, maybe three, to install the equipment at all three sites.
“You never know what complications you might be running into,” he said. “There are no motors up there. Everything will be done by hand.”
Poor weather could postpone installation because, as Moran noted, “helicopters need clear weather to fly.”
Minimizing effects
Installation of the three stations will come after five years of work with the U.S. Forest Service, which approved the project in August. The New York Times published a story last week about the long process to place volcanic instrumentation in wilderness areas on Oregon's highest peak.
To minimize environmental effects, the stations will be positioned away from trails and painted to blend in with the area.
“Since the Department of the Interior is a steward of America's public lands, one of our mandates is to ensure our scientific inquiries at USGS have as little impact on the landscape as possible,” USGS Director Jim Reilly said in a statement.
“Because this sensor network will have a relatively small footprint and we can access the data remotely from various locations, there will be very little disturbance to the environment and wildlife in this area. These stations represent a huge step forward in monitoring that helps us safeguard lives and property.”
‘Gold standard'
Once the three additional stations have been installed, there will be 11 seismometers and six GPS receivers on Mount Hood, Moran said.
Mount St. Helens, which he called “the gold standard” for volcano monitoring, has 20 stations within 10 miles.
Moran said a group of government and university scientists studied volcanos around the world and assessed what it takes to monitor a volcano before recommending 12 to 20 seismic and GPS stations within 10 miles.
“If Mount Hood were to wake up, would we be all set?” Moran asked. “And the answer is no. We would need to get more stations up there.”
Specifically, scientists would want to place a station on Mount Hood's summit, which currently is difficult because of “brutal weather” at the top of the 11,249-foot mountain, Moran said.
“One way of thinking about our observatory is we are like a fire department in that we need to be ready for an eruption,” he said. “But unlike a fire department, we don't have fires several times a day or several times a week.”
“Our job is to keep ourselves ready,” Moran added. “Part of that is taking seriously what we have seen around the world, and that is volcanos can wake up quickly.”

California Uber Alles

Texto completo: "As goes California, goes the country.” This perennial American phrase continues to hold relevance in an age of rapidly changing demographics and social values, isolation, and, as the New York Times’ Ross Douthat put it in a recent column, despair. Even as its nearly divine promises ring increasingly hollow, the Golden State nevertheless maintains a particular allure to those around the world, just as it did for its first European settlers in the 16th century.
Pop artist Lana Del Ray’s latest, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, attempts to analyze what the promise of California means in this era of despair. Does the state with some of the nation’s most fertile land, dramatic sights, creative energy, abundant wealth, and beautiful people remain America’s Eden?
“So I moved to California, but it’s just a state of mind,” Del Rey confesses in F--k It I Love You. It’s one of the strongest on a record that spans nearly 70 minutes and features tracks ranging from psychedelic rock to languorous ballads to idyllic odes to a new American sound book of sorts. Del Rey’s cover of Sublime’s Doin’ Time might even make music snobs reconsider their dismissal of the 1990s Long Beach-based reggae-rock outfit.
In an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this year, Del Rey addressed the record’s title: “It was kind of an exclamation mark: so this is the American dream, right now. This is where we’re at — Norman f-----g Rockwell. We’re going to go to Mars, and Trump is president, all right ... But it’s not a cynical thing, really. To me, it’s hopeful, to see everything as a little bit funnier. The chaos of the culture is interesting, and I’m hopeful that there’s room for there to be some movement and excitement within it.”
As much as Rockwell was lampooned at the time for his work being too saccharine, many of his paintings featured biting social commentary. His 1964 “The Problem We All Live With” featured a young black Ruby Bridges dodging tomatoes as she is escorted by federal marshals to a recently desegregated New Orleans school.
Most of Rockwell’s art was publicly consumed on behalf of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal agenda. His paintings, such as “Four Freedoms,” were always aspirational, never meant to reflect the present reality for all his countrymen.
That kind of idealism — where man and woman complement each other, where stardom is still just as glamorous as it was in the 1950s, and where California still offers boundless opportunity — is what draws Del Rey back to her newly adopted state, the limelight, or men who, “Act like a kid even though [they] stand 6-foot-2.”
“Why wait for the best when I could have you?” she asks in the album’s eponymous opening track.
Del Rey has no problem surrendering herself to things, be they drugs, the mythos of California, or men. In How to Disappear, she confidently admits her attraction to the hyper-masculine energy of a lover named “Joe,” who has “cuts on his face ‘cause he fought too hard” and “moves mountains and pounds them to ground again.” After all, she explains, “I love that man like nobody can.”
In the piano ballad California, Del Rey describes a lover who has wisened up and fled the state. But he need not worry: she’ll be waiting for him with all “his favorite liquor off the top shelf.” If the ethos of female pop music is “I don’t need no man,” then Del Rey is here to tell you that you’re a fool.
Of course, in an age of female musicians whose brands almost entirely revolve around empowerment and being a “girl boss,” Del Rey’s expression of femininity has unsurprisingly brought criticism. In 2014, she told Fader, “Whenever people bring up feminism, I’m like, God. I’m just not really that interested.” She’s more interested in “the future.”
And yet it’s her memories and those of California’s past that helps Del Rey maintain her sanity and hope for the future in our chaotic present. “Life on Mars isn’t just a song” anymore, she croons on The Greatest, which doesn’t bring much comfort when “L.A. is in flames” and former friend “Kanye West is blond and gone.” That’s all okay, though, when you’re living in the same place “where the Beach Boys would go.” “The culture is lit, and if this is it, I had a ball.”
If there’s one place to be disillusioned, it’s still California. On The Next Best American Record, Del Ray reminisces about listening to The Eagles and Led Zeppelin with a former lover in Malibu, driving through the 405, and consciously collecting experiences for, yes, “writing the next best American record.” And she did.

Bret Stephens: Trump is locked, half-cocked and probably bluffing

Texto completo: Thomas Jefferson warned against entangling alliances. John F. Kennedy was ready to pay any price and bear any burden. Teddy Roosevelt advised us to speak softly and carry a big stick.
And then there’s Donald Trump. Locked, half-cocked, and probably bluffing.
That’s the lesson Iran’s leaders appear to have drawn following a carefully calibrated sequence of escalatory attacks against the U.S. and its allies in recent months.
In May, there were four unclaimed attacks on tankers transiting near the Strait of Hormuz — two Saudi, one Norwegian, and one Emirati. In June, two more tankers were attacked, and U.S. surveillance video caught an Iranian patrol boat in close vicinity to one of the damaged tankers.
Later that month, Iran took credit for shooting down a $130 million U.S. surveillance drone, which the U.S. insists was flying in international airspace. In July, Iran seized a British ship and its crew after Royal Marines stopped an Iranian tanker suspected of trying to bust international sanctions against Syria.
And now we have Saturday’s strikes on the Saudi oil processing facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais, which temporarily knocked out half the Kingdom’s oil production. There’s a question as to whether the attacks were carried out directly by Iran or by the (Iranian-armed) Houthi rebels in Yemen, and it’s important to carry out the forensic and diplomatic work needed to make a conclusive and persuasive determination.
But it’s not too soon to think through the implications of the likely answer.
The first implication is that weakness was, is, and remains provocative — especially when it’s weakness masked in bluster. Trump may have the rhetorical impulses of Bob Dornan, but the Iranians have noticed that he has the strategic instincts of Dennis Kucinich.
In the months before the attack, Trump recoiled from using the military to send a message to Iran for shooting down the drone. He unsuccessfully sought a one-on-one meeting with Iran’s president. He fired his hawkish national security adviser. He even pondered ways to relieve Iran from the pressure of the very sanctions he imposed.
These are not the actions of a leader spoiling for a fight. Iran’s increasingly bellicose behavior is less of a response to U.S. economic pressure than it is an assessment of U.S. strategic will. Trump’s transparent hankering for a deal gives Tehran an opportunity to aggravate the crisis — all the better to extract favorable terms in a negotiation.
The second implication is that sanctions are a necessary but clearly insufficient condition for changing Tehran’s calculus. Though there’s no question that Iran’s ability to carry out mischief throughout the region has been strained by economic pressure, the regime has survived much worse. It can almost surely afford to wait out Trump.
What would Iran’s leaders really fear? Above all, a revival of the Green Movement that nearly toppled the regime following the stolen presidential election of 2009. As Omid Memarian of the Center for Human Rights in Iran noted recently in Foreign Affairs, “The ferocity with which the authorities have persecuted human rights lawyers, who bring abuses to both domestic and international attention, reflects their fear of exposure and their urgent desire to evade accountability.”
Unfortunately, the task of helping to revive the Green Movement — ideally, by providing the type of public and covert support the Reagan administration once gave Solidarity in Poland — has been made harder by Trump’s general indifference to human-rights issues, to say nothing of his rhetoric and policy toward migrants. Who knew that abandoning American values would have strategic repercussions?
A third implication is that we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of the American era in the Middle East. Trump has boasted of his willingness to support the House of Saud (not least when it is butchering journalists) and even seemed to be asking for Saudi direction when it came to responding to Saturday’s attacks.
At the same time, Trump has also made plain his desire to withdraw from Syria and Afghanistan (to Iran’s advantage in both cases), his reluctance to re-establish deterrence with Tehran through a limited military reprisal, and his general skepticism regarding America’s role in policing the global commons. That ought to be music to the ears of America’s quasi-isolationists, including Trump’s critics on the left.
But it ought to frighten America’s traditional Mideast allies. It’s long been obvious that Saudi Arabia can’t defend itself despite its $68 billion military budget — and that’s probably just as well. If the U.S. won’t defend it, who will? If it’s undefended, what might Iran do next? It’s worth remembering that there is a large and unhappy Shiite minority in eastern Saudi Arabia.
Those who don’t like Saudi Arabia as it is will like it even less when it’s gone.
That’s a thought that ought to be at the top of Robert O’Brien’s mind as he assumes the role of Trump’s national security adviser — with the tremulous optimism of a new bride joining Henry VIII at the altar. How the U.S. responds to an unprovoked attack on one of the central pillars of the global economy is a test of American leadership. The consequences of failure will be felt for years.

Texto completo: Shane Gillis's historically brief tenure on "Saturday Night Live" has turned into a referendum on an amorphous idea: cancel culture.
Shortly after Gillis was announced as a new featured player on SNL late last week, clips of the comedian using racist language about Asians on a podcast recorded last year began circulating online - along with calls for him to lose his new job. He tried to explain himself as a performer who "pushes boundaries." On Monday, SNL decided to part ways with him.
"This is just cancel culture. The guy shouldn't have been fired," comedian Jim Jefferies said Monday on David Spade's talk show. The Federalist, a conservative online publication, praised Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang for "refus[ing] to join cancel culture" when he offered to have a conversation with the comedian.
The concept has been around for a while, but this particular term has stuck in recent months. In a Netflix comedy special released a few weeks ago, Dave Chappelle decried "celebrity hunting season," prompting a round of content about "cancel culture." Republican leaders used the phrase while chastising actress Debra Messing for publicly shaming supporters of President Trump.
But what is cancel culture, which is simultaneously decried as everything that's wrong with humanity (or liberals, or Generation Z) and condemned as a made-up term that helps people escape accountability for past wrongdoing? Is there anything useful we can learn from this mess about the nature of comedy and the Internet?
Let's find out: Here's a step-by-step guide to how people end up endlessly arguing about the idea of cancel culture.
Step 1: The context Canceling someone refers to shaming a public figure for alleged wrongdoing and advocating for them to lose access to their platform. It is a group effort, and it usually plays out these days on social media - although similar boycott campaigns predate Twitter hashtags.
Cancel culture can refer to wildly different things, depending on whom you ask. Some people denounce it, pointing to instances of mob behavior and online infighting, or to situations where a career is jeopardized because of a bad tweet someone made as a teen.
But it also can be used to describe how traditionally underrepresented and oppressed groups harness the Internet and social media to hold powerful people accountable when institutions won't. That's been the case with the #MeToo movement, the wave of many, credible accusations of sexual misconduct against powerful figures in various industries following the New York Times' reporting on Harvey Weinstein.
Step 2: The news Gillis, relatively unknown to a national audience, got a huge career break last week when the news of his SNL hire was released. The announcement also included fellow comedians Chloe Fineman and the show's first East Asian cast member, Bowen Yang, a milestone that was widely celebrated. Then freelance comedy journalist Seth Simons tweeted a 2018 podcast clip of Gillis using racial slurs against Chinese people and making racist references to Chinatown.
Sometimes people who suddenly get a big job or become famous quickly try to get ahead of this public vetting, especially because there are plenty of recent examples of what happens when you don't purge your archive. Trevor Noah had to answer for his old tweets when he first got the "Daily Show" hosting gig, and Melissa Villaseñor caught similar criticism about tweets posted years before she was hired by SNL in 2016.
Gillis's comments were from last September. Someone had already deleted past episodes of "Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast" from its YouTube page, but there was still an active subreddit with a lot of content. Other writers dug around to see whether those first clips that went viral were isolated or part of a pattern, and they unearthed other racist, as well as homophobic and sexist, language.
Step 3: The debate Stand-up comedy, just like other art forms, has traditionally enjoyed an unspoken pact with the audience: Comedians can say pretty much whatever they want, and people in the crowd can feel however they want about the jokes. In live comedy, the power dynamics tend to favor the comedian who has the stage, spotlight and microphone. If a couple of people in the audience are deeply offended, the comic may never know about it.
But the Internet changed this relationship. The audience can do more than heckle a live performance; they can talk back, at length, and get a lot of people to listen.
This shift has prompted a huge debate among comedians and anybody with opinions about comedy. And Gillis's firing brought back many of those questions:
Where are the lines of decency? Is there room for forgiveness for old, hurtful bits? Gillis didn't say that stuff in a stand-up set but on a podcast - a more conversational format - so are these expressions of opinion or jokes? Given the content, does the distinction even matter? Is the comedian's intention relevant? Should a person who clearly felt it okay to say such things in any context be afforded a massive platform like SNL? Does giving that platform serve as a tacit endorsement of the language or, at the very least, that such language isn't disqualifying? Is "it's just a joke" an appropriate defense or a lazy one?
Step 4: The content This debate soon became fodder for endless stories about the broader cultural wars.
Fueling this commentary bonanza? Among other things: clicks. Stories claiming that "left-wing mobs" are attacking people online have become a mainstay of conservative publications, for instance. And stories about the racist pasts of minor public figures also have an enormous potential audience online.
Gillis initially responded to the increased attention by tweeting: "I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries. I sometimes miss." He added: "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually been offended by anything I've said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks."
Step 5: The consequences The content machines ran at full speed for an entire weekend until SNL producer Lorne Michaels said through a spokesman on Monday that Gillis was fired.
"We were not aware of his prior remarks that have surfaced over the past few days," the statement said. "The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard."
Gillis released a statement of his own: "It feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are. I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can't be taken away. Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand it would be too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a mad tv guy anyway."
Step 6: The second career options Canceling can cost opportunities; that's what it's designed to do. Roseanne Barr lost her show over her racist tweets. Kevin Hart lost his lifelong dream job, hosting the Oscars, over old homophobic tweets (though, financially, he is doing more than fine). Louis C.K. lost his manager and got iced out of Hollywood after he admitted to sexual misconduct. (While he is still touring and performing, it is without the prestige and cultural cachet he once had.)
Invoking cancel culture has been weaponized by its potential targets: Some celebrities, opinion journalists for national outlets and political figures have taken to minimizing it as a way to paint accountability, scrutiny or social justice advocacy as illegitimate outpourings of mob rule.
Being canceled happens when there is a mismatch between the thing someone said or did and the ethical expectations of their audience. Those who face consequences for their pasts do have an alternative to silence and repentance: They can cater to the fans waiting to champion the canceled as one of their own.
There is a whole cottage industry devoted to people who are upset by the idea of others being outraged. Content can be marketed to this population, and many mainstream institutions participate. Netflix has a vast category devoted to "politically-incorrect stand-up," including Chappelle and Ali Wong. The notion of cancel culture itself has become joke fodder in recent specials from Aziz Ansari and Bill Burr.
Now celebrities, cable news commentators and fans are talking about Gillis being a victim of this system. Fans posted that they hoped comedian Joe Rogan would interview Gillis on his wildly popular and divisive podcast. Hours after Gillis lost his SNL gig, prominent comics such as Norm Macdonald publicly reached out to offer support.
Gillis hasn't indicated what he's going to do next. But he now suddenly has a name with national recognition, which means he may have a new audience that could be very different from the one he would have reached on SNL. If he wants to pursue it.

F-35 PROJECT IS THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AT ITS WORST

Texto completo: Let's review some headlines from the past several years regarding Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, shall we?
From Fortune magazine: "Pentagon Report: The F-35 Is Still a Mess."
From Scientific American: "What Went Wrong with the F-35, Lockheed Martin's Joint Strike Fighter? The F-35 was billed as a fighter jet that could do almost everything the U.S. military desired but has turned out to be one of the greatest boondoggles in recent military purchasing history."
From Popular Mechanics: "WTF-35: How the Joint Strike Fighter Got to Be Such a Mess: The story of the F-35, and what went wrong to put the Joint Strike Fighter so far over budget and behind schedule."
From National Interest: "The F-35 Is a $1.4 Trillion Dollar National Disaster."
From Defense News: "The Pentagon is battling the clock to fix serious, unreported F-35 problems." From Americans for Tax Reform: "The F-35 is a 'big government' disaster in its worst form."
From the Foundation for Economic Education: "The F-35 Project Has Been a Disastrous Waste of Money: A cherished Pentagon boondoggle, the F-35 program is the most expensive weapons system in history."
The list goes on. And on. And on. The F-35 project, which a New York Times report recently referred to as "arguably the most notorious weapon ever produced," is such a fiasco that former acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan reportedly referred to the Lockheed Martin program that developed it as "f?-ed up." That got Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, in hot water, so the Pentagon's inspector general stepped in to examine whether the acting secretary was unfairly biased against a project developed by a competing cog in the military-industrial complex.
No, the inspector general determined, Shanahan did not display undue bias when he referred to the F-35 program as "f?-ed up," and complained about how frequently the planes were grounded. He was just repeating the common thinking at the Department of Defense. According to Military.com, "that sentiment appears to be widespread among Pentagon leaders. Witnesses said his comments about the F-35 program are consistent with those made by other defense leaders, the report states."
Michael Gilmore, the director of operational testing and evaluation for the Pentagon, was particularly blunt. "The F-35," he said, "is an extreme example of optimistic, if not ridiculous, assumptions about how a program would play out."
So where might this turkey land? At Madison's Truax Field. The prospect has stirred significant opposition locally, especially since a draft environmental impact statement released by the Air Force determined that bringing the National Guard's F-35 Fighter Squadron to town would subject almost 2,800 people to substantially increased noise levels with a 24-hour average sound level of 65 decibels or more. Some areas near the airport would become "incompatible for residential use," according to the report. With substantial spending to mitigate against the increased noise, homes in and around those areas might be made livable. But the questions of how decisions regarding mitigation will be made and what guarantees will be given Madisonians remain unresolved.
Proponents of the F-35 project remain enthusiastic about it, suggesting it could produce as many as 65 new jobs and, potentially, secure the future of the Truax facility. But state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said, "I just really question (whether 64 or 65 jobs are) really worth it to displace people. Is it really worth it to disrupt the quality of life for these people?"
Thousands of Madisonians are answering "no" because of concerns about the potential displacement and disruption that the military admits could be associated with the plan to base F-35s in the city. But even if the planes were silent, there's a strong case to be made against linking Madison's future with this F-35 fiasco.
Just last week, Defense News reported that the F-35 program as well as the F-22 "will not meet an 80 percent mission-capable rate requirement set by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis." Proponents of the F-35 project keep claiming things are getting better, arguing that Lockheed Martin is finally getting its act together. But, by too many measures, it remains the mess that the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was talking about during one of the last hearings he chaired while serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee. "The F-35 program's record of performance has been both a scandal and a tragedy with respect to cost, schedule and performance," said McCain. "It's a textbook example of why this committee has placed such a high priority on reforming the broken defense acquisition system."
Wisconsin has a rich tradition of objecting to the absurd excesses of the military-industrial complex. It goes back a century to when former Sen. Robert M. La Follette warned his constituents to be wary of "gentlemen interested in war as a business." Former Sen. William Proxmire became famous for identifying excessive and irresponsible Pentagon spending with his Golden Fleece awards. Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson led Senate battles against unnecessary weapons systems. And former Sen. Russ Feingold worked with McCain to identify and address abuses by military contractors including, notably, Lockheed Martin.
Objecting to the waste, fraud and abuse that is perpetuated by the military-industrial complex that former President Dwight Eisenhower identified is a Wisconsin tradition. La Follette laid the marker down long ago, declaring that we should always guard against "the tide of sentiment that, under the guise of patriotism, is actually based on commercial greed."
The F-35 project is an example of commercial greed at its most indefensible. It has no place in Madison or anywhere else in Wisconsin. CREDIT: John Nichols ; jnichols@madison.com and @NicholsUprising.

Trump prepara duro derechazo para inmigrantes que enfrentan deportación

Texto completo: La Administración Trump está sopesando la posibilidad de aumentar drásticamente los precios que los migrantes pagan en las cortes para apelar sus casos de deportación o para solicitar la ayuda de un juez que reconsidere sus reclamos en los tribunales.
Los mayores afectados serían los migrantes que se encuentran detenidos por el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE , en inglés) y los que fueron devueltos a México para esperar por la resolución de sus peticiones de asilo en tribunales estadounidenses.
Según documentos obtenidos por la web informativa BuzzFeed News, los oficiales solicitaron que los migrantes paguen $975 dólares por la apelación de un fallo de un juez de inmigración y $875 dólares para solicitar que un caso sea reabierto o reconsiderado por la Junta de Apelaciones de Inmigración.
Actualmente, el precio para ambos procesos está instituido en $110 dólares cada uno. La nueva medida podría influir sustancialmente en la manera en que los inmigrantes apelan la decisión de los jueces en los casos de deportación .
Algunos expertos también consideran que un gran número de migrantes verían reducidas sus opciones para solicitar protección o un estatus legal.
“Están esencialmente privando a las personas del derecho a apelar, eso es mucho dinero. Es un aumento sustancial de las tarifas que está fuera del alcance de las personas “, explicó la ex jueza de inmigración en San Francisco, Rebecca Jamil.
De acuerdo con BuzzFeed News, el Departamento de Justicia no quiso hacer comentarios al respecto, pero varios oficiales señalaron que los costos de los procesos no habían aumentado desde 1986 y que, si lo hacían era, se debía a un abarrotamiento en las cortes del país.
“La administración no ha puesto énfasis en el debido proceso de los inmigrantes: estas tarifas parecen estar a la luz de ese patrón. Creo absolutamente que esto disuadirá a las personas de tomar decisiones atractivas, incluso si son injustas “, señaló Sarah Pierce, analista de políticas del Instituto de Política Migratoria.
Bajo la actual administración de Donald Trump, los casos de apelación se incrementaron hasta 30,000 durante el año fiscal 2018 .
Un artículo de The New York Times reveló que en el mes de las cortes de inmigración tenían más de 800,000 casos pendientes, lo que significaba que se necesitaba un promedio de 700 días para procesar cada uno de ellos.
Si se aprueba, la medida no se haría efectiva de inmediato, puesto que las regulaciones requieren de un periodo de discusión de 60 días.

Gas Prices In Pa. Expected To Rise Following Attack On Saudi Oil Facilities

Texto completo: Gas prices at the pump are expected to rise 15 to 30 cents over the next few weeks because of the weekend attack on Saudi Arabian oil fields, a petroleum analyst said Monday.
The impact of the Saudi attacks will be felt almost immediately, said Patrick deHaan, head of petroleum analysis, Gas Buddy. “They depend on supplies of gasoline they get Monday night.”
It is conceivable that gas stations will be passing along higher prices within a day or two, he said.
Andrew Kleit, Penn State University professor of Energy and Environmental Economics, said that based on the market increase by 13% of the price of a barrel of crude oil Monday, “We could see an immediate 15 cents increase at the pump in a day or two.”
Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, told The New York Times that Monday’s jump was expected to add about 20 cents to gas prices. He added that the typical American family uses 90 gallons of gas each month, adding $18 per month in fuel expenses as a result of the attack.
DeHaan believes the price rise will be more incremental, pennies a day over the next few weeks. “I don’t think it is going to happen all at once. I think it will be measured more in pennies per day almost every day or so for the next one to two weeks. Either way, expect to see the price rise pretty quickly.”
In Greater Hazleton, some of the early price increases have been between 10 and 20 cents per gallon this week.
AAA lists a 3-cent change in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton market from Monday to Tuesday.
Luzerne County has the highest gas prices in the area, at an average of $2.728 per gallon Tuesday. Schuylkill County fuel costs $2.697 per gallon, while Carbon County pumps average $2.661 per gallon —only Juniata, Montour and Blair counties in Central Pennsylvania have lower average prices.
According to AAA, gas prices across the state rose 5 cents per gallon for regular fuel from Monday to Tuesday, and 3 cents for other grades and diesel. The average price for a gallon of regular gas, $2.73, is still 30 cents less than it was a year ago.
Within Pennsylvania, prices are generally higher across the northern and western counties.
Drones fired multiple cruise missiles in the bombing of Saudi Arabia’s Abqaiq oil processing plant and a key oil field Saturday. The U.S. blames Iran for the attack, which was claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. A Saudi military spokesman has said “Iranian weapons” had been used in the assault.
The expectation now is that Saudi Arabia gets its oil production back on line very quickly, within a matter of a week, deHaan said. “If they don’t manage to do that there will be more of a pricing effect that lasts for a longer period of time. The restoration is something Saudi Arabia has to do, so we’ll have to see if they can stick to that scheduled restoration.”
It is important to note that this isn’t oil companies arbitrarily raising prices, deHaan and Kleit emphasized.
This is a fact, deHaan said: “There is a finite amount of oil, and when we woke up Monday morning, there was 5 million barrels less of oil to satisfy the market’s demand. This is certainly a lesson in economics. Now, with a lot less oil on the market, people are getting more desperate. This is about buyers that are having to bid more for a product that is suddenly less available.”
It is typical that whenever there is a cutoff in oil supply, people normally blame oil companies, Kleit added. “Here what we have is an external event, we have reduction in Saudi supply, so naturally the price of oil and other products are going to go up.”
Meanwhile, there is a distinct possibility the president would, if needed, offer oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, which holds several hundred million barrels of crude oil, deHaan said.
“Knowing that there is oil available, should it be needed would have more of a psychological impact, and perhaps limit the rise in oil prices,” deHaan said “I don’t know that we’ll have to reach into the strategic reserve somewhere in the U.S. We should be able to make due without it.
“But the situation certainly could change,” he said. “There are still a lot of unknowns.”

Texto completo: Trump reality check
Editor: President Trump’s supporters rave about the great job he has done over the past 2½ years.
This would be a good time for a reality check. Consider the following topics:
■ The economy. When Trump took office in January 2017, he inherited from President Obama a strong, healthy, growing economy that had produced 76 consecutive months of positive job growth. If you compare Trump’s first 29 months in office with Obama’s last 29 months, almost 1 million more jobs were created under Obama.
■ The stock market: Under Obama, the S&P index 500 grew by 56.4%, under Trump it has grown by 21.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average under Obama grew by 50.6%, under Trump it has grown by 25.2% The Nasdaq grew by 92.9% under Obama and by 34.2%under Trump.
■ The border wall: To date, not one inch of new border wall has been built. Mexico will not pay for it. Trump is desperate to begin construction on it, so he wants to steal $3.6 billion from the Pentagon budget. That would have an adverse effect on military bases and families at home and abroad.
■ Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act with a great health plan. Obamacare has not been repealed and Trump and the Republicans still have no health care plan.
■ Make America great again. Since Trump took office, the number of white nationalist groups expanded by 50% in 2018 alone, according The New York Times.
■ Foreign policy. It appears that Trump is intent on fulfilling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dream of driving a wedge between the United States and its allies. Trump has poisoned the relationship with the leaders of every major ally of the United States. In the meantime he has stood by Putin on key issues.

Shapiro’s overreach
Editor: Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro came to town recently to celebrate Constitution Day.
Shapiro is an upwardly climbing lifetime Democratic politician who no doubt has an eye on higher office.
To that end, he has set his sights on Graham Spanier, a former Penn State University president, whose numerous charges in the Jerry Sandusky scandal have come down to one - a minor one, no less - for which Spanier was scheduled to serve a two-month sentence when a U.S. magistrate judge dismissed the conviction. You might have thought that Shapiro would let the matter go, but he has chosen to appeal, saying that nobody is above the law.
That’s true, but people are also above being harassed by the law.
Shapiro is persecuting Spanier. Shapiro should remember former Gov. Tom Corbett, who, when running for re-election, was advised in a bumper sticker found on many cars across the commonwealth: “I’m from Penn State and I vote.”
It’s time to resurrect that bumper sticker.

Cleanup unity urged
Editor: Attempts to deal with erosion along Leggetts Creek are not working.
Has anyone noticed the danger on the northbound side of the creek in the notch area along Routes 6 and 11? I would wear a hard hat when I cleaned there. Rocks are falling.
The area I spent the most time in there cannot have novice help. The Great American Cleanup won’t help because organizers say, “It’s too dangerous on that road,” and I agree. I asked cleanup organizers to supply garbage bags and was told, “No, we don’t want to encourage you.” They were correct there, too. Cleanup costs were covered mostly by scrap money, but there’s nothing to be made when you pick up garbage.
Anyone who complains about the environment and does nothing should lose the right to complain. Clean up your yard, help a neighbor clean up, clean up eyesores in your neighborhood and make a difference.
Besides cast iron pipes cut apart and left in the creek and forest to rot, and a billboard with a 35-inch I-beam and 35-inch steel pole cut off and laying in a swampy, garbage-filled area in the Notch, there are things of greater concern. There was a hidden sewage hose connection. It was hidden in bushes with parts secured in place with the discharge end in the creek. There were lead rings from busted pieces of cast iron at their seams, 15 to 20 pounds of lead laying on the ground or the rocks of the creek.
The fish survive there somehow, but I wonder about the toxicity. I found other toxic items and did not feel well for three days after exposure.
But I have ideas. The area is too dangerous for novices and requires a concerted, professional and supportive public effort to address its cleanup needs - and it has many.

Renew weapons ban
Editor: I wonder how many people know that Republicans in Congress refused to renew the federal assault weapons ban when it came up for renewal in 2004.
Can you imagine how many lives it could have been saved in the last 15 years if the ban had been renewed? The National Rifle Association was at least as powerful than as now and must have made huge donations to keep Republicans in power to vote against a renewal of the ban.
I guess it shows money is more important than human lives.
There is a bill to renew the ban on assault weapons sitting on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s desk and he refuses to bring it to a vote.
How much longer will the American people allow this to go on?

Texto completo: General counsel to the Department of Homeland Security John Mitnick has been fired, according to media reports.
The move comes as DHS is contending with multiple lawsuits in response to immigration policies.
According to The New York Times, which first reported the move on Tuesday, the White House made the call to fire Mitnick.
"We thank John for this service, and we wish him well,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to USA TODAY.
The DHS spokesperson said that DHS Principal Deputy Joseph Maher will take over for Mitnick. The spokesperson did not provide a reason for Mitnick's departure.
The agency has overseen Trump administration immigration policies such as zero tolerance and the public charge rule, which would bar from entry immigrants who are deemed likely to become recipients of public aid services.
Several states including California, Maine and Pennsylvania have filed suit against the department and other immigration agencies over the public charge rule.
The administration recently announced that it would seek to hold migrant children indefinitely in detention with their families, thus ending a 1997 ruling that limits the amount of time children can be held to 20 days.
Mitnick was nominated by President Donald Trump for the position in August 2017 and confirmed by the Senate early 2018.
The department has seen multiple staff changes over the last several months, including former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned in April amid tension with the administration, and former DHS aide Andrew Meehan.
Mitnick, too, was reportedly being eyed by the White House for dismissal back in April.

Texto completo: SPRINGFIELD — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul this week said he would reject a settlement agreement with opioid manufacturer Purdue Pharma under its reported current terms and announced a lawsuit against several other opioid manufacturers.
In April, Raoul’s office filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of the opioid OxyContin and defendant in thousands of other lawsuits from local municipalities and states affected by the opioid epidemic.
Raoul’s suit alleged the company "dispatched sales representatives to Illinois hundreds of thousands of times" between 2008 and 2017, and "funded third-party publications under the guise of educational materials to promote opioids and downplay their risks."
Raoul alleged these tactics more than tripled prescriptions of Purdue’s opioids in Illinois. In a news release, he pointed to Illinois Department of Public Health statistics that showed more than 2,000 Illinoisans were killed by opioid overdoses in 2017. IDPH also reported instances of babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which can be caused by opioid exposure, increased by 64 percent from 2011 to 2017.
In August, Raoul expanded the suit against Purdue to include members of the Sackler family, which founded and operates Purdue Pharma.
"The Sackler family knowingly misled the public and continued pushing Purdue’s addictive opioids without care or consideration of the death and destruction their product caused," Raoul said in a statement Wednesday.
Raoul’s statement was in response to media reports that detailed a tentative settlement between Purdue and thousands of municipal governments and more than 20 states.
The New York Times reported the deal, for which final details are still being negotiated, would compel Purdue to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and dissolve. A new company would be formed that could continue selling OxyContin and other medicines, but its profits would be used to pay the plaintiffs in the suit, which was reported to be worth $12 billion.
Purdue would also be required to donate drugs for addiction and overdose treatment, and the Sackler family would donate $3 billion in cash over seven years but would not be forced to admit any wrongdoing.
Raoul, however, was among at least 20 attorneys general who told NBC News they had not agreed to the deal.
"My office is prepared to hold the Sacklers accountable, regardless of whether or not Purdue declares bankruptcy, and I am pleased that a majority of states will continue to fight," he said in a statement.
According to the news release, Raoul’s expanded suit asks the court to "prohibit Purdue and the Sacklers’ deceptive conduct" to ensure "it does not happen again in the future," and to assess penalties against the defendants. Raoul is also asking the court to require the defendants to pay to help remediate the opioid problem and forfeit profits resulting from the alleged misconduct.
"I reject in the strongest terms, any agreement that does not adequately hold the Sackler family accountable for the irreparable harm their actions caused to families in Illinois and across the country," Raoul said in the statement. "My office expanded our lawsuit against Purdue Pharma to include the Sacklers because as the family behind Purdue, their ruthless pursuit of profits destroyed other families and communities throughout Illinois and the nation."
Raoul filed a similar lawsuit Tuesday against 16 other opioid manufacturers, alleging they "carried out unfair and deceptive marketing campaigns that prioritized profits over public health."
The companies’ actions, Raoul’s office said in a news release, "resulted in unprecedented levels of opioid prescribing, while the distributors irresponsibly flooded Illinois with opioids, failing in their role as gatekeepers in preventing the diversion of opioids."
Raoul’s lawsuit seeks similar results as the one against Purdue: to "abate and remedy the statewide public nuisance," prohibit the manufacturers’ and distributors’ "deceptive and unfair conduct" and force penalties on the companies.
The companies named in the suit are Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Endo Health Solutions Inc.; Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.; Cephalin Inc.; Allergan Finance LLC; Actavis Pharma Inc.; Actavis LLC; Watson Laboratories Inc.; McKesson Corporation; Cardinal Health Inc.; and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation.

For its 20th birthday, Mark Bittman's 'How to Cook Everything' is getting a not-so-minimal update

Texto completo: “How to Cook Everything" has made its way into more than a million first apartments, college dorms, and family homes since it debuted. Guided by author Mark Bittman's chatty, relaxed coaching, countless cooks have used the book to get comfortable in the kitchen. “Anyone can cook, and most everyone should," wrote Bittman in its 1998 introduction. Recipes relied on pantry staples, and built aptitude in basic techniques.
If your vintage copy is hanging on by the pancake batter, you're in good company — and help is on the way. Twenty years after its first release, a completely revised anniversary edition will feature updated recipes, color photos, and an emphasis on sustainability.
On a recent afternoon from his Hudson Valley kitchen, Bittman reflected on the two decade mark.
“You know, 'How to Cook Everything' was never intended to be, 'This is the best way to do this, and this is the best way to do that,' " he said. “It's more, 'This is a really good way to do this that's not going to drive you crazy, and it's going to work.' "
Cleaning up from lunch, Bittman could see his small flock of chickens from the kitchen window. As he clattered, it was impossible not to wonder how the cookbook author and former New York Times “Minimalist" columnist stocks his own pantry.
Bittman reports he's in what he calls “spend-down mode," the time of year when he works through the “10 or 15" types of beans and whole grains on his shelves, augmented by his own garden bounty. He's an avid bread baker and enjoys making tortillas; his simple spiced lentils went over well with recent dinner guests. In essence, he practices what he preaches.
“I do think that's the strategy," he said. “It's not 'go to the store and buy haddock.' It's 'go to the store, buy what looks good, and then I'll help you figure out how to cook it.' "
The 1998 edition reversed baroque tendencies of the 1970s with a simpler “come as you are" approach to cooking. Instead of delivering complicated shopping lists and unwieldy techniques, “How to Cook Everything" invited readers to make the best they could with what they had.
The 20th anniversary edition introduces color photography, something the debut did without, instead relying on Bittman's calm narration to bring recipes to life.
“That was a very conscious decision in the original 'How to Cook Everything,' and it's an equally conscious decision to put them in," said Bittman.
At the heart of the update is how people consider meat.
“If [I] speak in front of an audience and I say, 'Who's eating less meat than they were 10 years ago?' every single person, except for the people who want to appear rebellious, raises their hand." said Bittman. “Not only do people eat meat less frequently, we tend to eat less meat at each serving."
The revised book reflects that change, reducing the emphasis on meat-centric courses, and shrinking the portion size of those dishes — a shift that began in 2008 in a 10-year anniversary update, which launched alongside a vegetarian edition.
“Certainly [for] people of my generation, everybody ate a steak when you sat down to eat beef," said Bittman. “Now in my experience, we cook a steak and divide it two or three or four ways."
A desire to reduce meat intake is part of Bittman's broader thinking around not just how we cook, but the impact of our consumption. He first began writing “How to Cook Everything Vegetarian" as soon as he completed the debut book. This past spring, Bittman launched a new Medium publication called “Heated," which he aims to serve as a platform for more complex food conversations, beyond simply pleasure and nourishment.
“For years, food has not been taken seriously," he said. “We talk about the economy. We talk about politics, we talk about, to some extent, the environment. But we haven't talked enough about agriculture, where food comes from, and how it's produced."
All of that takes root in the kitchen. In the 1998 edition, Bittman lamented the creeping prevalence of convenience food in our diets. “Why are people eating so much junk?" he asked at the time. “Why are they eating in restaurants so much, and why is home cooking dying? That was my crusade."
Since then, he sees some things changing for the better. “I used to have to drive across town to buy soy sauce and olive oil. . . . And now, obviously, those kinds of things are in every supermarket," he said. But disappearing farms and an increase in monoculture means that while local ingredients may be easier to find, prices are higher, and overall, he said, food quality seems to be lower.
That's bad news for our tastes and our diets alike.
“Everyone in the United States has been raised to have problems with food, because we're encouraged to eat junk food, animal products, and sugary food from the time we're born," he said.
“That's how our palates have developed, and study after study show those styles of eating in general are, if not addictive, highly habitual. To break those habits is the work of a lifetime."
But it's possible.
Back in the '90s, Bittman mused that he'd be successful if he could convince Americans to eat rice and beans once a week. Now, he said that's not so lofty a goal — whole grains and legumes once a day could be a new target.
“It seems to me the change happens slowly, even in your own kitchen," he said. “It happens by seeing that there's a different way, and moving towards that."
Still, there are bigger forces in play.
“To put all of this change on individuals is to ignore that our choices are limited to what's out there," he said. For instance, if the majority of supermarket products are made from monocropped corn and soybeans, “We're not getting the kind of choices that we ought to get."
That's too much for any one home cook to solve, he said. “It's sort of the same thing as saying, 'Buy a Prius, turn off your lightbulbs, decrease your food waste,' or whatever other perfectly sound ideas are out there about reducing your carbon footprint."
What we need, said Bittman, are policy changes that impact the way we farm, process, and produce food. “Those changes can't be made for the most part by individuals. They have to be made by regulation, by government, by mandate."
So what's for dinner these days? Two decades later, the Minimalist himself is still simplifying.
“Julia Child once said to me, 'I don't get what's going on with Italian food — all they do is put a few herbs and olive oil on stuff and stick it in the oven.' And that's exactly right," he said.
“Not to take to anything away from her, because obviously, she turned zillions of people on to cooking — but back then it was, 'how elaborate can I make this dish?' and now it's kind of, 'how simple can I make this dish?' and I think that's real progress."
He chuckled. “I would say that."
For many, progress looks like a book so well-loved it has a calorie count of its own. Don't feel too bad if your copy has seen better days — it turns out that it's not entirely your fault.
“The bindings were just terrible!" said Bittman. “People thought, 'Oh my God, I really abused this book!' But in fact, they fell apart immediately."
Veteran readers and fledgeling home cooks alike will have a chance to start fresh when the 20-year edition hits shelves next month. This time, the book takes on a new flavor for Bittman.
“I had no idea this was going to happen, that I was going to write this arguably staple cookbook for a generation or two," he said. “That's a totally cool thing. And it's equally true that there is a broader world out there in the world of cooking."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
It was just past 10 p.m. on Sunday when The New York Times sent out the alert: "Ric Ocasek, a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame artist and the lead singer of the Cars, was found dead in his Manhattan apartment," the notification read. "He was 75."
He was 75 ... right?
The New York Police Department said he was, and some news articles relied on a 1944 birth date. But other sources -- including Mr. Ocasek's New York voter registration information and biographies on Spotify and Pandora -- indicated he was five years younger. Without a readily accessible birth certificate, how could The Times be absolutely certain?
In the hours after Mr. Ocasek's death became public, not many others seemed to be sure, either. The top result of a Google search for Mr. Ocasek's age says he was 70 -- a number that seems to be pulled from the singer's Wikipedia page, which by Monday morning had been edited dozens of times since his death and, at one point, had included both 1944 and 1949 as potential birth years.
And on the home page of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which the Cars were inducted into last year, a memorial to Mr. Ocasek on Monday morning listed his birth year as 1949. (It was changed to 1944 later on Monday.)
Even past reporting from The Times contributed to the confusion. An introduction to a 2006 story about the singer's music recommendations said he was 57, which would indicate that he was born in 1949.
So on Sunday night, here's how Mr. Ocasek's obituary by Jon Pareles, The Times's chief pop music critic, put it: "Sources have differed on Mr. Ocasek's age -- some saying he was 70 -- but a few public records and previous articles about him suggest that he was 75."
After the obituary published, Times reporters and researchers kept finding clues that pointed to an earlier birth date for Mr. Ocasek. In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Mr. Ocasek said he graduated from Maple Heights High School, near Cleveland, in 1963 -- which would mean he was born around 18 years earlier, unless he got his diploma as a 14-year-old prodigy.
There are also yearbook photos, as well as personal accounts from a Facebook group filled with Maple Heights High School alumni, that corroborate 1963 as his graduation year.
The Times found a court record showing that in 1988, a man named Richard T. Otcasek -- the singer's legal name -- was cited in Baltimore for speeding and driving with an expired license. His birth year for these citations was given as 1944.
It's not clear how the 1949 birth date circulated, but it's likely that Mr. Ocasek himself played a role. It seems much more probable that a rock star would want people to think he's younger than he is, rather than older. Musicians and actors publicly shaving off a few years -- or, in Mariah Carey's case, claiming that she doesn't have a birthday at all -- isn't anything new, and Mr. Ocasek declined to disclose his age in some interviews.
Then there is Mr. Ocasek's voter registration in New York, again under his legal name, Richard T. Otcasek. Mr. Ocasek registered with a birthday of March 23, 1949.
Voters provide their personal details, including a birthday, themselves when registering. This information isn't verified by the Board of Elections, Valerie Vazquez, a spokeswoman with New York City's board, said in an email.
Voters do, however, have to sign an affidavit confirming the accuracy of the information on their registration form, she added. The form threatens a fine of up to $ 5,000 and up to four years in jail if the information provided isn't true -- a high price for a few extra years of youth, if that was the case.
With most -- but not all -- evidence pointing to 1944, declaring Mr. Ocasek's age with absolute certainty can be tricky, especially when the best person to verify with is no longer with us. But on Monday, The Times felt certain enough to make a definitive change to Mr. Ocasek's obituary. The story no longer alludes to any conundrum: He was 75.
For what it's worth, it seems that Mr. Pareles caught on much earlier with his suspicions about Mr. Ocasek's real age. He "claims to be twenty-nine," Mr. Pareles wrote for Rolling Stone in January 1979, "but looks a few years older."

Don't believe the victim, says New York Times reporter — she was probably drunk!

Texto completo: New York Times reporter Robin Pogrebin seems determined to humiliate her newsroom at every turn — and all for the sake of selling her new book.
First, she published a hilariously ill-advised tweet from one of the Times' main social media accounts this weekend, promoting an excerpt from her upcoming book. Pogrebin then threw her editors under the bus after the excerpt placed in the paper’s Sunday Review section was found to have excluded relevant exculpatory details regarding allegations that Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as an undergraduate at Yale University, once dropped his trousers during a party and that friends then “pushed his penis into the hand of” an unidentified female victim.
The problem is that the alleged victim of this treatment is telling friends she doesn't remember any such thing. And so Pogrebin has responded by claiming that the woman was probably too drunk at the time to say whether it did or did not happen.
The alleged victim was “incredibly drunk at that party, as was everyone,” Pogrebin said Tuesday in a radio interview.
The unidentified woman declined to be interviewed by the Times, according to the Times. Pogrebin has not interviewed this woman and cannot possibly know how many drinks the woman supposedly had that evening. Yet Pogrebin is perfectly comfortable accusing the alleged victim of being drunk that evening, possibly too drunk to say whether she had someone's penis placed into her hand.
What could motivate a journalist to attack a victim in this way? Why, a desire to downplay concerns that the alleged victim of Kavanaugh’s alleged depredations featured in Pogrebin’s upcoming book reportedly does not at all recall the thing being alleged. The sole source of the allegation, Democratic consultant Max Stier, talked to investigators but refuses to speak publicly about what he claims he saw all those years ago. The only reason anyone even knows about Stier’s allegation is because two unnamed government “officials” who claim to “have communicated with Mr. Stier” passed the story along to Pogrebin and her co-author, Katy Kelly.
But never mind all that, Pogrebin said Tuesday in a radio interview. Stier, who first brought his story privately to the Senate and the FBI during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, is a serious man. Very serious! So serious that you cannot put too much weight on what the alleged victim says she does or does not remember. Remember, the Times journalist said, the alleged victim was intoxicated at the time and probably cannot be trusted to remember.
“And so I think we’re talking about memory here. It’s, you know, a really kind of a questionable issue,” Pogrebin said Tuesday. “There are plenty of things that, you know, that are conceivable that could happen when people are too drunk to remember them.”
Stier, on the other hand, he was surely not drunk. The warning about memory and alcohol applies only to those who dispute Pogrebin's reporting.
The excerpt published this weekend by the Times originally included the following passage:
We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirez’s allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. (We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier.) Mr. Kavanaugh did not speak to us because we could not agree on terms for an interview. But he has denied Dr. Ford’s and Ms. Ramirez’s allegations, and declined to answer our questions about Mr. Stier’s account.
This is the full extent of what the Times reports regarding the Stier allegation. He told officials privately last year that he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party when they were all students at Yale. Stier also said he saw Kavanaugh's friends push Kavanaugh's penis into a woman's hand (I am not even sure how that works, logistically speaking). That's it. That is all there is to this allegation. Stier has declined to go public, and the alleged victim herself turned down the Times' interview requests. That this allegation made it to print at all is nothing short of shocking. That it made it to print without originally including details about how the alleged victim does not recall the alleged incident is inexcusable.
The Times amended the published excerpt later so that it now includes an editor’s note that reads [emphasis added]:
An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.
Even before the Times updated the op-ed with these exculpatory details, Pogrebin had already called a social media firestorm down on her newsroom by tweeting from the New York Times' opinion section Twitter account: “Having a penis thrust in your face at a drunken dorm party may seem like harmless fun. But when Brett Kavanaugh did it to her, Deborah Ramirez says, it confirmed that she didn’t belong at Yale in the first place.”Tweet.pngSince then, Pogrebin has gone on to blame her editors for omitting the fact that Stier's alleged victim apparently does not recall what he claims he saw. Now, as to why Stier won’t go public or talk to the Times about his allegation, Pogrebin has some interesting ideas there as well.
“My sense is that he feels as if he did his duty, which was he brought the information that he had to the Senate — to senators and to the FBI. He made them all very aware that he had this experience that he had witnessed firsthand in a dorm room during his freshman year at Yale. What they did with the information was up to them. It never materialized and became part of the process,” she said Monday in an MSNBC interview.
She added, “Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and [Stier] was done. His work had been done. He had done his part. And he had no interest in revisiting it.”
If this were a baseball game and Pogrebin a pitcher, we all would be screaming at the dugout to pull her. That the Times has not sent the manager to the mound yet is nearly as unbelievable as the paper’s assertion that it was an honest editing mistake that omitted the exculpatory evidence from their Kavanaugh essay.

The Jeffrey Epstein donations: Is an apology from the MIT president good enough?

Texto completo: They knew.
In his most recent letter about the unfolding scandal over MIT's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, university president Rafael Reif said officials had “limited facts" about the late financier's crimes when the institution began accepting gifts from him in 2012.
But really, how could MIT not have known the following?
■ That Epstein in a controversial deal with Florida prosecutors pled guilty in 2008 to two charges of soliciting a prostitute, including one involving a minor.
■ That by the time Epstein was released from prison in 2009, after serving 13 months, more than a dozen civil lawsuits had been filed by women who alleged they were molested by him when they were underage. Some victims were as young as 14.
■ That Epstein had to register in New York in 2011 as the highest-level sex offender.
All of this information was readily available — from the pages of the Palm Beach Post to The New York Times. You don't need a degree from MIT to figure out how bad Epstein was. You could have just Googled him.
Of course, they knew.
No matter how Reif wants to spin it today, university officials knew that it would be a PR nightmare if word ever got out that Epstein was a regular donor to the MIT Media Lab. That was clear from a bombshell report in The New Yorker that exposed the secrecy and how former Media Lab director Joi Ito worked to keep Epstein's money hidden by marking donations anonymous.
The Globe's Deirdre Fernandes later reported that Ito had hardly acted alone; top Massachusetts Institute of Technology officials worked closely with Ito to ensure Epstein's gifts didn't draw attention.
Ito began courting the multimillionaire in 2013, raising about $525,000 via Epstein's foundations and perhaps millions more by using his connections.
Ito resigned on Sept. 7 .
Epstein also donated money to MIT professor Seth Lloyd in 2012, and Reif signed the thank-you letter.
They knew, but still didn't care.
“You don't have to think hard about whether you want any connection to Jeffrey Epstein," said Wendy Murphy, an attorney who teaches sexual violence law at New England Law Boston and is a former sex crimes and child abuse prosecutor. “What kind of child prostitution is OK with MIT's list of values?"
In his letter last week, Reif wrote that senior members of his team were aware of Epstein's gifts starting in 2013 and raised concerns.
“They knew in general terms about Epstein's history — that he had been convicted and had served a sentence and that Joi believed that he had stopped his criminal behavior," Reif wrote. “They accepted Joi's assessment of the situation. Of course, they did not know what we all know about Epstein now."
Here's the thing about people convicted of sex crimes: They have to register as sex offenders because there's a high risk they will re-offend.
Reif went on to reveal that Epstein gifts were discussed “at at least one of MIT's regular senior team meetings, and I was present."
So why didn't he say something, do something, then?
The truth is what we know about Epstein today is what we knew about him in 2008 and 2009. We knew the FBI and others investigated him for sex trafficking of minors and that he was able to negotiate a sweetheart deal on lesser charges.
“There is nothing new now. It's all the same allegations, everything," said Florida attorney Spencer Kuvin, who represented three of Epstein's victims, including a 14-year-old who was ordered to strip naked and perform a sex act.
What is different is the same allegations are taking on new meaning in the post-me-too era. In 2018, some victims began to come forward to tell their stories to Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown, who spent a year re-examining Epstein's case. A federal judge ruled in February that Epstein's original agreement with prosecutors violated the Crime Victims' Right Act by not informing his victims about the deal ahead of time. Authorities began to once again interview potential Epstein victims from the 2000s.
In July, the US attorney in New York charged Epstein with sex trafficking of minors. At his court hearing, one of Epstein's lawyers called the new allegations “ancient stuff" and a “redo" by the government.
The 66-year-old Epstein was being held in a federal facility in Manhattan when he was found dead in August. His death has been ruled a suicide by hanging.
“I am aware that we could and should have asked more questions about Jeffrey Epstein and about his interactions with Joi," Reif wrote. “We did not see through the limited facts we had, and we did not take time to understand the gravity of Epstein's offenses or the harm to his young victims. I take responsibility for those errors."
MIT has hired the law firm Goodwin Procter to investigate the university's ties to Epstein. Last week's letter was Reif's fourth to the campus in less than a month. Reif in his first letter offered “a profound and humble apology" to Epstein's victims. He committed to raising an amount equal to the funds MIT had received from Epstein, money that would be donated to a charity that will benefit his victims or other victims of sexual abuse.
It will now be up to the school's board to determine whether saying sorry is enough. Ultimately, how Reif handles the Epstein donations and its fallout reflects how the university values women.
At any organization, the culture is set from the top. The infection that started in the Media Lab has now spread to another lab after visiting MIT computer scientist Richard Stallman asserted in an e-mail to colleagues last week that one of Epstein's underage victims had presented herself as “entirely willing" to have sex.
Stallman resigned on Monday.
Who should be next?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The two New York Times reporters who wrote the essay containing a new accusation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh spent Tuesday morning explaining why the initial report left out information about the alleged victim not having any recollection of the incident.
Speaking on MSNBC, Robin Pogrebin, one of the reporters who wrote the essay along with Kate Kelly, said that her editors had removed clarifying information about the alleged victim and her account of the incident as a result of a New York Times practice of not naming victims.
The omitted section described how the person involved in the incident in which reportedly Kavanaugh's "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student" did not want to be interviewed and did not remember the incident, according to her friends.
The Times had cited another man, Max Stier, as the witness to the incident who had later reported it to the FBI during his confirmation process.
The Times later added a note clarifying that fact and added the information into the article.
"I think what happened actually was that we had her name and, you know, the Times doesn’t usually include the name of the victim," Pogrebin said. "So I think in this case the editors felt it was better to remove it, and in removing her name they removed the other reference to the fact that she didn’t remember it. "
Later Tuesday, in an appearance on ABC's The View, Pogrebin said that people had focused too much on one part of the essay and that "people have seized on certain things and magnified them for their own purposes. "
"It's fine to have a bunch of Democratic presidential candidates calling for impeachment but that was before the book came out," said Pogrebin, also noting the outrage the essay prompted among conservatives.
Their essay, adapted from their forthcoming book "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" included reporting about a newly surfaced misconduct allegation, as well as additional details about an accusation of sexual misconduct by Deborah Ramirez, a former student at Yale University.
Kavanaugh has denied all of the allegations.

More: Ayanna Pressley to introduce impeachment resolution against Brett Kavanaugh
The New York Times story and the reactions to it have resurfaced frustrations around the Kavanaugh confirmation on both sides. Conservatives say the story is the latest attempt to "smear" Kavanaugh, and some Democrats are pushing to reopen the debate over whether the justice should have been confirmed to the Supreme Court a year ago.
President Donald Trump called the Times a "journalistic disaster" in a series of tweets Tuesday and called for the resignation of everyone involved in the publication of the Kavanaugh story.
And in an opinion piece in Fox News, Republican National Committee spokeswoman Elizabeth Harrington slammed the attempts to use "unverified claims to launch political witch hunts" and denounced what she saw as a "new low for the media. "
The left faces its own debate over Kavanaugh, with several Democratic presidential candidates and members of Congress calling for his impeachment.
More: Democrats are calling for Brett Kavanaugh to be impeached. How would that work?
Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. , introduced an impeachment resolution against Kavanaugh Tuesday, saying lawmakers have a "responsibility to collectively affirm the dignity and humanity of survivors. "
But the controversy seems unlikely to affect Kavanaugh's place on the court. Senior Democratic leaders appear not to want to move forward on impeachment, and the Republican-controlled Senate would almost certainly reject any attempt to remove Kavanaugh.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler told WYNC on Monday that his committee would be "concentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president and that's going to take up our limited resources and time for a while. "
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , who has called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, sent a letter to Nadler on Tuesday proposing "additional structures to pursue an investigation, such as a special task force or outside counsel. "
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. , the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told Politico on Monday that "We’ve got to get beyond this ‘impeachment is the answer to every problem. ’ It’s not realistic. "
“If that’s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we’re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families,” he said.
Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S. C. , said Democrats were attempting to gain political advantage by attacking Kavanaugh.
"It must be an advantage in their world to call for impeachment based on an article that's false," Graham said. "It's going to backfire. It's going to blow up in their face, I hope. "

KAVANAUGH TWEET BY NYT GETS APOLOGY

Texto completo: When the New York Times revealed a new allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh this weekend, the political world was again thrown into turmoil. Democrats, including several presidential candidates, called for further investigations and impeachment, while President Donald Trump and top Republicans staunchly defended the embattled judge.
But amid that furor, the Times also weathered fierce criticism over how it framed the news and promoted it on social media. On Sunday, the newspaper apologized for a tweet that said the type of misconduct in the claim against Justice Kavanaugh "may seem like harmless fun" and updated the article to reflect that the woman at the center of the latest allegation reportedly does not recall the incident.
The Times wrote that the tweet "was clearly inappropriate and offensive. We apologize for it and are reviewing the decision-making with those involved."
Drawing on reporting from an upcoming book by two Times reporters, Saturday's piece focused largely on Deborah Ramirez, who came forward last year to accuse the then-Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her during a dorm party at Yale University in the 1980s. The article was published in the Times's Opinion section and was titled "Brett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not."
Call for impeachment
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Monday he believes the House should impeach President Donald Trump, and now it's his committee's job to convince the public that it's the correct course of action before the House moves forward.
"Personally, I think President ought to be impeached," Mr. Nadler told WNYC's Brian Lehrer.
Mr. Nadler's comments were some of the most detailed he has offered thus far about his rationale for the House to pursue impeachment. He said that he believes the House should act on impeachment, even if the Senate will not remove the President, because Congress has to "vindicate the Constitution."
Maine explosion kills 1
An explosion on Monday morning killed one firefighter and critically injured five other people at a building in Farmington, Maine, that had just been evacuated because it smelled like propane, officials said.
Capt. Michael Bell, 68, a 30-year member of the Farmington Fire Department, died in the blast, which destroyed a two-story building housing an organization that serves people with disabilities, according to Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety.
Scott Landry, a Farmington selectman, said the building housed staff members for the organization, Life Enrichment Advancing People, or LEAP. No clients were in the building, which had recently finished being constructed, he said.
Florida serial killer
Genetic genealogy led Florida investigators to a suspect in a 2016 killing, and he has been linked through DNA and other forensic evidence to at least three other slayings from a decade prior, authorities said Monday.
Even with that link, it was a cigarette butt that the suspect dropped at a bus station last week that led to his arrest, court documents indicate.
Robert Hayes, 37, was arrested Sunday without incident. A Palm Beach County judge ordered him held without bail Monday on a first-degree murder charge, pending a grand jury proceeding.

Faith-Based Clinics Aren't The Answer

Texto completo: AUSTIN, Tex. -- In its quest to "defund" Planned Parenthood and end access to clinical abortion care, the federal government under the Trump-Pence administration is poised to recreate a public health disaster that has blighted the already heavily damaged reproductive health care safety net in Texas, where lawmakers recently replaced seasoned medical providers with Bible-thumping grifters.
In 2016, an organization of crisis pregnancy centers applied for a Texas family planning grant. The Heidi Group told the state of Texas that with just $ 1.6 million in taxpayer dollars, it could transform itself from a small religious nonprofit that had never provided comprehensive reproductive care into Planned Parenthood minus the abortion referrals.
But the Heidi Group couldn't make the transformation. Investigations are continuing, but state data suggests that the organization treated only a small fraction of the 70,000 Texas patients it promised to serve, even after being selected to receive a second round of state funding that would have funneled a total of over $ 6 million to the organization.
The Heidi Group's failure to deliver was so egregious that a former employee told The Texas Observer, "That's sinful, to take that amount of money and not use it for what it was supposed to be used for."
And yet the Heidi Group's founder, Carol Everett, is still in the mix. In January, as Ms. Everett's state funding sources were drying up during investigations into the Heidi Group's finances, she applied for federal family planning dollars -- money from Title X, the program that Planned Parenthood has backed out of because of the Trump-Pence administration's domestic gag rule that prevents providers from discussing abortion with their patients. When that application failed, Ms. Everett tried again in July, this time under a new name: Vita Nuova Inc.
At first glance, it is puzzling that someone at the center of such a public kerfuffle would seek to recreate the very conditions that landed her there, and on a bigger scale. But a closer look reveals the logic behind Ms. Everett's efforts: What happened in Texas with the Heidi Group wasn't a mistake, or bureaucratic blunder, or gamble that just didn't pay off. It was supposed to be a new kind of government-and-faith-group partnership predicated on a shared ideology that, if not expressly religious, was rooted in conservative Christian beliefs and practices, and for which the state had been laying the groundwork for years.
When Texas booted Planned Parenthood out of publicly funded reproductive care programs in the early 2010s, journalists and activists -- myself included -- investigated the state's claims that a hodgepodge of nonspecialist providers could fill in for Planned Parenthood, all coming to the same conclusion: Nope. As the years went on, the state's own numbers showed that Texas' safety net programs served many fewer patients than were seen by Planned Parenthood, culminating with the Heidi Group scandal.
Now similar efforts are being made at the federal level, and this time, funds are being awarded to a fake clinic organization from California with ties to none other than the Heidi Group.
Ms. Everett's first application for Title X funding was made together with California's Obria Group. Like the Heidi Group, Obria is led by one woman on a religious crusade, Kathleen Eaton Bravo, and first sought local funds (which it has been accused of misdirecting) before turning its attention to Title X.
Ms. Bravo has promised her supporters that Obria will never provide hormonal contraception, saying she'll contract with other providers to fulfill that need, and the federal government liked her proposal. It awarded Obria $ 1.7 million, but gave nothing to the Heidi Group. Ms. Everett persisted with her next application as Vita Nuova, simultaneously filing suit against the federal government under the presumption that Vita Nuova will be denied Title X funds because it intends to refuse care to L.G.B.T.Q. clients, in violation of federal law (for now).
Ms. Everett and Ms. Bravo are hellbent (or perhaps, in their view, heaven-bent) on seizing an opportune political moment. Vice President Mike Pence, who was at the vanguard of the anti-abortion movement's early attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, is now in a position to move federal barriers out of the way for these conservative Christian groups that say they can provide health care. Already, this administration has weakened federal protections against discrimination in health care, while instituting policies such as the domestic gag rule.
Moves like these make it clear that the administration's intent is for those who rely on Medicaid and other public programs to be forced to seek care from faith-based providers who are tasked with delivering services that they not only have no experience providing, but which their leaders sometimes find morally repugnant or run contrary to their own stated religious values. Those services could include hormonal contraception, STI treatments for sexually active unmarried people, and fertility and adoption counseling for L.G.B.T.Q. people.
For years, conservatives have claimed to want to run government "like a business," getting the public used to the idea that anyone but the government should run government programs. Now, we know who "anyone" is: those who espouse extreme right-wing beliefs on sexuality and regressive views of what it means to be an American family.
Discrimination is intended to be a feature, not a bug, of public services under the Trump-Pence administration. As we have seen in Texas, when providers who are best equipped to deliver health care services are replaced by ideologues who are more interested in biblical signs than vital signs, it will be low-income people, communities of color, and L.G.B.T.Q. folks who pay the price -- literally, with their tax dollars, and bodily, as providers deny care according to their religious whims.

From 'my generals' to 'my Kevin,' Trump's possessiveness has a dual interpretation

Texto completo: President Trump has used it with groups and individuals. He has used it for family members and employees. And he has bestowed it on Washington politicians and middle-of-the-country farmers.
For Trump, the possessive pronoun "my" is a term of endearment - one he dispenses with freely, from "my generals" to "my Peter" Navarro, one of the president's senior economic advisers, to "my little Melania," his wife.
Trump uses the pronoun affectionately, part of an almost subconscious effort to shine warmth on someone in his orbit, say current and former aides, who describe the linguistic tic as a doting gesture. But others say the habit can also seem belittling and, for Trump, that it may be as much about dominance and control as familiarity.
Tim O'Brien, a Trump biographer who is critical of the president, said that while he has never heard the president use the phrase dismissively - "he always uses it to convey you're part of the home team," O'Brien said - the practical reality is more complicated.
"He thinks he's conveying a compliment to the people he says it about, but in fact, it's not really about putting them on equal footing," said O'Brien, executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion. "I read anytime President Trump starts a statement with 'my' that it's completely in the possessive, and it's about ownership, and it's about control."
And with Trump, O'Brien added, the modifier provides only minute-to-minute reassurance. "You can go from being 'my' to being gone in a tweet that goes out in 15 seconds," he said.
The president's preferred possessive was in the spotlight most recently on Friday, when the Wall Street Journal reported that as Trump awaited Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi at the Group of Seven summit last month in France, he jokingly called out, "Where's my favorite dictator?"
In response, Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter who covers the White House, tweeted a "partial list of people the president has recently referred to as 'my,' " including Sissi, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, an unnamed reporter and an unidentified African American man at one of his campaign rallies.
Indeed, Trump deploys "my" widely and frequently. Just before his January 2017 inauguration, the president-elect gazed across a ballroom during a celebratory lunch at the Trump International Hotel and used the diminutive for then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) - a pet name that was viewed as verbal evidence of the two men's strong political relationship.
"Where's Kevin," Trump asked. "There's my Kevin."
More recently, recounting a congressional softball game where Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), playing second base, fielded a "smash groundball" and threw it to first, Trump extolled Scalise and referred to him warmly as "my Steve."
"Who could have that but my Steve, right," Trump said, speaking before the American Farm Bureau in New Orleans earlier this year.
Trump also refers to "my farmers" with some regularity. Speaking in the Roosevelt Room in May in solidarity with the nation's farmers and ranchers, the president was clear in his support: "I have to take care of my farmers with disaster relief," he said.
A month earlier, at a rally in Michigan, Trump urged the nation's farmers to hold tough in his trade wars with China and the European Union, saying, "There may be a little pain for a little while, but ultimately for my farmers, I love my farmers."
Sam Nunberg, a former Trump 2016 campaign aide, said that during his time in Trump's employ, the habit felt purely affectionate. "Occasionally he'd be like, 'Oh, my Sam! How's my Sam doing? What's my Sam up to?' "
With business relationships, Nunberg added, proclaiming faux ownership over an individual is, to Trump, simply a form of flattery. "He's very good at making people feel as if they're the center of the universe, and that's part of his charm," he said.
Yet the president's use of the possessive pronoun can also go awry, as it ultimately did after Trump, spotting Gregory Cheadle, who is black, at a 2016 campaign rally California, shouted him out fondly, though not by name.
"Oh, look at my African American over here!" Trump said, pointing at Cheadle, who at the time was a Republican who had unsuccessfully run for Congress. "Look at him! Are you the greatest?"
But last week, Cheadle announced he was leaving the Republican Party, in large part because of the behavior of the president, who Cheadle said has "a white superiority complex." When asked last week about Cheadle, who is now running for a House seat as an independent, Trump said he didn't know who he was.
Trump also regularly refers to "my generals" and "my military," seeming to assert a type of ownership over the nation's civilian defense institutions that has irked some in the U.S. military community.
Ann Burnette, a professor of communication studies and presidential rhetoric at Texas State University, said that in some ways, Trump falls into a long tradition of many of his predecessors.
"Presidents often use pronouns to signal identification with an audience, so they'll often use pronouns like 'we' or 'our' to signal that closeness," Burnette said. "So when a president uses a personal possessive pronoun, that communicates intimacy, and sometimes that can be effective."
Problems can arise, however, when that intimacy is either inappropriate or presumptuous, Burnette said. Proclaiming Sissi "my favorite dictator," for instance, struck many as inappropriate.
"We don't want to hear a president talk about his intimacy with or admiration for a dictator," she said. And, she added, "When he says 'my African American,' that presumes the person he's talking about feels the same closeness, and that might not be the case. Same with 'my farmers' - some farmers might feel that closeness, but some might not."
Trump has also referred to "my base" in almost paternalistic terms, such as last month when, shortly before boarding Marine One, he was asked by reporters whether his base supported background checks for gun purchases.
"I think my base relies very much on common sense, and they rely on me, in terms of telling them what's happening," the president said.
Trump has previously described first lady Melania Trump as "my little Melania," including, according to the New York Post, during their lavish Palm Beach, Fla., wedding ceremony in 2005.
More recently, the president has introduced some members of his Cabinet as "my secretaries," and, according to Factba.se, an online database that collects all of Trump's rhetoric, has referred to "my people" more than 250 times. For the president, "my people" seems to be an anonymous and amorphous group that includes, but is not necessarily limited to, his base, his top advisers, his campaign and, simply, his pals whom he sometimes consults.
Trump associates generally say a playful "my" is a descriptor to be savored, not spurned. Nunberg, who was ultimately fired from the 2016 Trump campaign, said that as his relationship with Trump grew more tense, his boss bestowed "my Sam" upon him with less frequency.
"He may genuinely feel affection at that moment, too, because in my experience, when I was on the outs and being pushed aside, I got less and less of those," Nunberg said.

Texto completo: The New York Times ran an eye-catching correction online late Sunday night.
“An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hands of a female student at a drunken dorm party,” the correction begins.
At this point in the correction, any person who had followed the accusations against Kavanaugh, and the media coverage of them, knew where this was going.
“The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.”
It’s almost hard to believe. The Times published an article on the front page of its Sunday review section accusing a man of possible sexual assault, yet omitted the fact — known to the reporters — that the alleged victim had no recollection of the incident.
Anyone who read the Sunday Times in print was thus thoroughly misinformed by the Times. Anyone who read the story online in the first 24 hours after publication similarly was misled. The Monday print edition didn’t even carry a correction.
Thus misled, dozens of Democratic lawmakers called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. The Times’ news story on those impeachment calls once again included the accusation, but without mention of the alleged victim’s denial. It was an amazing self-reinforcing news cycle of political propaganda fueled by misinformation.
There’s another detail on this Sunday Times piece. Max Stier, the named accuser in an assault reportedly denied by its alleged victim, is a partisan Democratic operative and attorney who worked opposite Kavanaugh and Ken Starr on the defense team of Bill Clinton, who had lied about his extramarital affair with an intern half his age.
How did the Times reporters describe Stier? “Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington.” Incredible.
The Times’ news reporters had filed, in effect, a prosecutor’s brief that omitted known exculpatory evidence. The exclusion of known exculpatory evidence (such as a victim’s denial) is considered to be misconduct when a prosecutor does it. But prosecutors have an agenda by design. It’s far worse when supposedly objective reporters do it. What’s clear is that the Times’ aim here was not to inform the reader. So we are left to speculate on what these journalists and their editors are up to.
The most innocent explanation for their misconduct is that the authors and their editors are greedy and hope to sex-up thin allegations so that they can sell books. Normally, this explanation would be enough, but it fits too neatly into a pattern that extends way beyond the desire to make a tidy six- or even seven-figure sum on a book.
The Times in 2018 assigned an opinion writer, openly and stridently opposed to Kavanaugh’s nomination, to write a news story about him — on which she did a pretty lousy job. NBC published multiple totally uncorroborated and later debunked, stories accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When none of the other witnesses could confirm any details of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh, and as her story kept shifting, the media provided an assist for the Democrats’ backup plan: to claim that Kavanaugh had perjured himself. They served this cause by misrepresenting, quite flagrantly, what Kavanaugh had actually testified about never having blacked out from drinking. Outlet after outlet led readers to believe that Kavanaugh had denied being drunk, which he in fact had not done.
[Related: 'Just didn't make any sense': Friend of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford now challenges her story]
News outlets always make errors. But throughout the 2018 Kavanaugh fight, and in the renewed scuffle sparked by the Times this week, the errors and the lapses in journalistic standards by the networks and the Times always, without fail, seem to lean in one agenda-driven direction.
Given this pattern of misinformation to undermine Kavanaugh, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that NBC, the New York Times, and other outlets wanted to defeat Kavanaugh, and that having failed to do so, they now want to continue inflicting as much pain upon him as possible.
Every conservative who feels that the press is out to punish conservatives has found confirmation in the Kavanaugh ordeal. And it happened all over again on Saturday night. It is no defense that the Times corrected its error after Mollie Hemingway, co-author of Justice on Trial, spent much of the weekend shaming the Times for its journalists' professional misconduct.
When it all comes down to it, this entire saga is about the right to kill babies in the womb, just as Blasey Ford's attorney told the same journalists behind this report. When Roe v. Wade next comes before the court, the Times, most of the media, and all of the Democrats will use the repeatedly debunked and never-even-slightly-corroborated accusations against Kavanaugh to argue that any ruling undermining Roe is “discredited” or illegitimate because of the charges.
This helps explain behavior on the Left, including at the Times. In the eyes of honest observers, though, it’s not Justice Kavanaugh who has been discredited. It is his ruthless and heavily biased prosecutors in the press.

Joe Biden faces another social justice struggle session

Texto completo: The social justice-driven mauling of Joe Biden continues. After the former vice president said at the Democratic presidential debate last week that our never-ending apology for slavery should focus on black families and education, social justice liberals rose from their coffins to claim their pound of flesh.
Biden had transgressed Democratic Party dogma that explicitly states: No white man shall speak to the ills and trials of the aggrieved (in this case, black people). The absolute best Biden could have done in his situation was to do what every other Democrat running for president is doing, which is to make some vague promise about a “panel” or “commission” that will then “study” reparations.
Sens. Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have all made that condescending pledge, and they’re all sitting pretty. But Biden made the mistake of proposing real, tangible solutions to wrecked black families. That leaves him two burst blood vessels away from being labeled a full-blown klansman.
Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow said Sunday that Biden’s “positioning on racial issues” is “problematic.” White guy Ryan Grim at The Intercept said Biden’s answer at the debate was an example of “blatant racism.” Friday on MSNBC, so-called political analyst Zerlina Maxwell said Biden’s answer was “tone deaf,” “completely out of touch,” and “wildly offensive.” Later in the same segment, she again called the comment “tone deaf.”
The issue initially raised at the debate was already stupid. One of the moderators asked for Biden to account for something he had said about reparations nearly 50 years ago — "I'’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago” — and how Americans generally should “repair” the “legacy of slavery.”
Biden’s answer was difficult to follow, but it can basically summed up as: Black families are too broken down and repairing them means committing resources to education and parenting. “We bring social workers into homes and [to] parents to help them deal with how to raise their children,” he said. “[T]hey don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure ... you have the record player on at night. Make sure that kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor school — a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there.”
Problems with the black family are real and social scientists, scholars, and researches have documented them all at great length over the course of several decades. It’s a fact that 70% of black children are born out of wedlock, a rate that’s astronomically higher than any other group in the United States. Furthermore, 66% of black single mothers don’t have a high school diploma, compared with only 18% of white single mothers.
Princeton professor Sara McLanahan and Harvard professor Christopher Jencks digested those depressing numbers in a 2015 paper, writing that “a father’s absence lowers children’s educational attainment ... by disrupting their social and emotional adjustment and reducing their ability or willingness to exercise self-control.”
The Washington Post in 2014 wrote, “the disadvantages of education are much more severe for black children” raised by single mothers.

These are facts that can’t be acknowledged in today's Democratic Party. Point them out and you're a racist.
This was always going to be a problem for Biden. There’s nothing worse than being born white in today's Democratic Party, and that goes double if you're a man. The terrain for whites and men is dotted with landmines that can only be skirted by way of issuing endless pathetic apologies in the vein of Beto O'Rourke. Incidentally, it doesn't seem to have done him much good.
Biden has already apologized for being white, for having touched women on their shoulders in public, and for the confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, which Biden voted against.
Now he’s expected to submit to the social justice mob for having proposed a solution to real black problems, which amounts to more than just giving away free money with no strings attached.
The truth about reparations and racial justice is that their advocates have no feasible policy proposals to address either. The reality is that both issues, to the extent that we can seriously call them “issues,” exist purely for the purpose of perpetually reminding America that “victims” reign supreme in our national discourse, and should be regarded with utmost reverence.
As described in my forthcoming book, Privileged Victims: How America’s Culture Fascists Hijacked the Country and Elevated Its Worst People, oppression, grievance, and victimhood now set the tone for everything in the Democratic Party. And no amount of submission or self-abasement is ever enough.
As Charles Blow wrote on Monday, there is nothing Biden or anyone can do to truly atone for slavery. “[A] fact is a fact,” wrote Blow, “and no amount of growth, change, or well-intentioned good-heartedness has the ability to erase it.”
We should drop the issue altogether, because the social justice crowd was never interested in finding a solution. They were only ever interested in reminding Biden and the rest of us of who’s in charge.

New York Times sinks its Kavanaugh claim with Editor's Note stating alleged victim 'does not recall the incident'

Texto completo: More than a day after publishing a bombshell exposé detailing a new sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the New York Times added a significant passage, along with an editor's note, that undercuts the claim.
The report published Saturday evening was adapted from an upcoming book by reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, titled "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation" and due out Tuesday.
The Times reporters revealed the account of one of Kavanaugh's male classmates at Yale University, Max Stier, who said he witnessed Kavanaugh make inappropriate sexual contact with a female student in the mid-1980s. Stier notified the FBI and senators about the incident. Although the FBI did not investigate the claim, two officials who communicated with Stier corroborated the story to the Times.
In the updated version of the article, the following passage was added: "the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode."
"An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article," read the editor's note at the bottom of the story that was added Sunday evening.
After the report's publication Saturday, liberal activist organizations and some 2020 Democratic candidates called for Kavanaugh to be impeached. President Trump defended Kavanaugh in a salvo of tweets and urged him to "start suing."
Stier's account echoes that of Deborah Ramirez, who previously accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his penis into her face at a drunken dormitory party, prompting her to swat it away and accidentally touch it in the process.
As noted in the Federalist, the Times reporters also did not mention that Stier was one of the attorneys representing former President Bill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation in the 1990s while Kavanaugh was part of Ken Starr's team leading the inquiry.
Kavanaugh faced other allegations of sexual misconduct, including that of Christine Blasey Ford, who last year testified during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings that he had attempted to force himself on her at a high school party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations put forth by Ramirez and Ford, but did not answer questions about Steir's account.

The crisis in the Border Patrol isn't a mystery, and Democrats are to blame

Texto completo: A very long New York Times article published on Sunday explores the state of the Border Patrol, which the paper describes as being in a “morale crisis.”
“The Border Patrol, whose agents have gone from having one of the most obscure jobs in law enforcement to one of the most hated,” read the report, “is suffering a crisis in both mission and morale.”
Wow, that sounds awful. What could possibly be the problem? I bet the Times is eager to get to the bottom of it.
“Some agents blamed migrant parents for bringing their children into the mess,” the Times explained. “Their anger began building under President Barack Obama.” That’s as close as the four authors of the story get to answering who is responsible for the depressing cloud cast over an entire government law enforcement agency. You have to read nearly 40 paragraphs in before you get to the obvious truth. It comes in the form of a quote by an anonymous agent who’s been with Border Patrol for 10 years.
“I have personally not come across any agents that do not like [President] Trump’s positions on border security, on immigration. Hispanic, Latino, black, white — it doesn’t matter the origin of the agents, they all have a strong border-security mentality," the agent said. "So they love what Trump brings to the table. What they hate, what is detrimental, is the complete opposite feeling from the Democratic side.”
The Times offered no additional context to that sentiment. The fact that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez falsely accused border agents of forcing detained migrants to drink out of toilets goes unmentioned. The fact that House Democrats have refused to do a single thing to stop the hundreds of thousands of Central Americans from throwing themselves, sick and poor, into the care of border agents is ignored. The fact that Democrats have directly compared border enforcement to Nazi Germany is just shrugged off.
None of that was included in the Times report. The “morale crisis” is instead described as though it’s a natural occurrence with no clear remedy.
But in fact, there is a clear remedy. It’s called closing the asylum loophole. It’s called ending every dumb policy and welfare benefit that incentivizes all of the Western Hemisphere’s destitute to jump across the border with the expectation that they’ll be taken care of by the American taxpayer.
The “morale crisis” isn’t a mystery and we all know who’s to blame for it.

Would-be witness in Kavanaugh case shows rare courage

Texto completo: Leland Ingham Keyser is my new heroine.
Keyser is the high school friend identified by Christine Blasey Ford, the accuser of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, as the other young high schooler at the small gathering at which Ford said Kavanaugh forcibly groped her. All along, though, Keyser has said she remembers no such gathering, nor ever meeting Kavanaugh.
Now, with the publication of a new book on the Kavanaugh mess by two New York Times reporters, those allegations and two others from Kavanaugh’s Yale days are receiving renewed attention. Most of the commentary has focused on the alleged incidents at Yale and the new, albeit tremendously dicey, supposed corroborations thereof.
What should not be lost in the shuffle, though, is the new reporting the book’s authors did with regard to Ford and Keyser. Keyser is a former Georgetown women’s golf coach and political podcast producer for her ex-husband Bob Beckel, the very liberal longtime foil for Fox News’ mostly conservative lineup. Keyser reportedly leans at least somewhat leftward politically as well.
Keyser reportedly came under enormous pressure from decades-long friends and from liberal activists to change her story so as to give more credence to Blasey Ford’s account. Suffering from chronic pain due to a major neck injury and knee replacement, along with other health issues, it would have been easy, not to mention ideologically satisfying, to give in and offer some sort of half-fudged statement that seemed to give Ford’s account more credibility.
Instead, Keyser stood firm. Not only did she say she doesn’t remember such a gathering as the one described by Ford, Keyser also now specifically says she has reason to disbelieve her longtime friend. In doing so, she has faced pressure, criticism, ostracism, and (reportedly) threats against her reputation.
“The harsh glare of the public eye has taken a tremendous physical, emotional, and financial toll on her,” wrote her son, Alex Beckel.
Still, Keyser continues to refuse to bend the truth. Still, she persists.
Keyser’s integrity is an inspiration. Here’s hoping it is appreciated, even by Kavanaugh’s political foes.

Texto completo: The New York Times wants to relitigate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s spot on the bench, and it’s willing to sacrifice its credibility to do so.
The paper dropped a report over the weekend detailing what actually aren't new accusations against Kavanaugh, although the fact that it bills them as "new" might be the least misleading thing about the report.

The reporters, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, went back over Deborah Ramirez’s supposed encounter with Kavanaugh in a new book. Ramirez, recall, accused the then-Yale freshman of sticking his penis in her face, forcing her to “swat it away and inadvertently touch it.” But no one present when this supposedly happened remembered it occurring. Also, recall that during the Kavanaugh hearings, Ramirez attempted to coach people to remember her version of events so that they would back up her story.
The story of the other accuser — an unidentified woman neither remembers the incident nor came forward with the accusation herself — was brought forward by another classmate, Max Stier. This allegation was reportedly shopped to Senate Democrats during Kavanaugh's confirmation, but they didn't find it credible enough to act on it, as the Judicial Crisis Network’s Carrie Severino notes. And the Washington Post apparently had the story a year ago but refused to print it because it couldn't confirm anything.
Essentially, two old accusations lacking credibility have been conveniently repackaged to sell books. They are not the bombshell the Times wants them to be. As before, neither has been credibly corroborated and therefore neither is believable.
The whole piece is thoroughly dishonest and irresponsible, especially given that the Times conveniently left out two important details in its report. First, Stier, the Yale classmate who allegedly witnessed Kavanaugh’s encounter with the second unidentified woman, is a longtime Democratic consultant who worked on Bill Clinton’s defense team during the federal investigation into his affair with Monica Lewinsky. But the Times reporters chose to describe Stier as the head of a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C., and a “respected thought leader,” which, for all we know, he could be. But the fact that they felt a need to hide his actual significance as a political operative shows you that they knew they were hiding something. It's evidence, as they say in the law, of mens rea.

More important, the Times failed to mention that the very allegation it detailed has been denied by the Yale woman whom Kavanaugh allegedly victimized. That’s right: The girl Stier claimed was sexually harassed doesn’t remember the incident at all and has consistently denied that it even happened, according to her friends. In their book, Pogrebin and Kelly “quietly” mention this, according to Mollie Hemingway, who obtained a copy before it releases on Tuesday. But the Times story neglected it completely. Only after Hemingway and others shamed them on Twitter all day Sunday did the Times' editors finally get around to adding an editor’s note explaining this key fact, which pretty much undermines the rest of the story.

“An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hands of a female student at a drunken dorm party,” the correction reads. “The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.” (Emphasis added.)
So why didn’t the Times include this information from the get-go? Because it would have made the story too dull to print — a mere re-hash of what was known already. Again, this seems like evidence of mens rea. This whole thing was apparently just an attempt to sell some books and perhaps revive a long-debunked narrative ahead of an election year.

The New York Times, and everyone else who jumped on the anti-Kavanaugh train without waiting for corroboration, wants to be right. They want the last word; the I told you so; the ability to point the finger at those who defended Kavanaugh and say, Look what you did. But this would require them to withhold context, print baseless accusations, and abandon integrity.
Naturally, they jumped at the opportunity.

Maureen Dowd: Let’s debate: Are the Democrats doomed?

Texto completo: Washington • He’s in our heads.
Even more than we knew.
It isn’t just that he hovered over the Democratic debate Thursday night: Should the candidates attack him or leave him to self-destruct? Were they talking about him too much or not enough?
It’s more profound than that.
Donald Trump has fundamentally altered the way we experience politics.
We’ve been trying to figure out for three years if he is a mad aberration, doomed to fade, or if he is rewiring the game in some permanent way.
Watching that depressing debate, one must conclude that the rewiring is well underway.
Trump is one of the phoniest people ever to walk the earth. Maybe that’s why he was uniquely suited to tear through the phony conventions and bloated world of consultants that made up politics as usual.
There were a lot of good politicians on the debate stage in Houston. But the night rang hollow as they clung to the old conventions — the overcoached performances, the canned lines, the pandering, the well-worn childhood anecdotes meant to project “relatability.”
Tactics superseded passion and vision. Everyone seemed one tick off. Unlike with Barack Obama in 2008, none made you feel like you wanted to pump your fist in the air and march into the future behind them.
“Being a good politician doesn’t matter anymore,” lamented one freaked-out congressional Democrat afterward. “It’s like being a great used car salesman. We need a Holden Caulfield to call out all the phonies.”
It’s a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron about a moron: Trump’s faux-thenticity somehow makes the Democratic candidates seem more packaged, more stuck in politician-speak.
In speeches and at rallies, Trump kicks over the traces, saying what’s on his mind, even though it often doesn’t mesh with reality, even though it lacks dignity and can be ugly and hateful.
Just consider his speech at the House Republican retreat in Baltimore, happening at the same time as the debate. Basking in chants of “Four more years!” Trump unleashed several buzzwords and crowd-pleasers, trashing eco-friendly paper straws and energy-efficient light bulbs.
“The bulb that we’re being forced to use — No. 1, to me, most importantly, the light is no good,” he said. “I always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst. But No. 2, it’s many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly — I don’t know if you know this — they have warnings. If it breaks, it’s considered a hazardous waste site. It’s gases inside.
“And,” the Narcissus president repeated a couple of times for good measure, “the light is not as good. I mean, frankly, the light is not as good.”
He offered his usual aria of insults to the assembled shameless Republicans, calling Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” and Joe Biden “Sleepy Joe.”
“And now it looks like she could beat Sleepy Joe,” Trump said. “He’s fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he’s doing or saying.”
He made a Pete Buttigieg short joke and referred to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “Cortez” because her name, he said, is too long. He called the squad “A.O.C. plus three” and warned of the “grim specter of socialism.”
He mocked the Green New Deal, saying: “That’s a beauty. No more cows. No more planes. I guess no more people, right?” Then he teased Kevin McCarthy, House Republican leader: “Because Kevin is just like a cow. He’s just smaller.”
The split screen Thursday night was riveting. You know that the barbarian behind the White House gates will run with all the ammunition the Democrats were supplying him in real time.
The president said, “Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans,” and Beto O’Rourke said, “Hell, yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” The president said the Democrats would impose “crippling taxes,” and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed all their free stuff that would require tax hikes.
This exact display from Trump is just what many Americans find exhausting. It’s draining to live on the edge all the time, to be plunged into the culture wars — and now the straw and light-bulb wars — with the tweets and the tantrums and the put-downs, to feel that we’re being borne back ceaselessly into the past.
But how to counter this?
“No one made the broadest, most appealing message for change,” David Axelrod said of the debate. “Can we, as a country, function anymore if we have another four years of waking up to turmoil?”
There were a bunch of high-end, professional pols there and yet no one actually won it. Not a good sign. The candidates struggled to alchemize our exhaustion into excitement. The three hours seemed endless, with two questions hanging over the night: “Can’t anybody here play this game?” and “Will the most beatable candidate in American history win twice?”

Texto completo: A war with Iran in question. A billion-dollar bankruptcy deal. And we get to the bottom of the "Corn Pop" situation. Here's the news to know Monday.
First, we know the guac is extra: But has anyone noticed a change in Chipotle's guacamole?
Trump doesn't want war with Iran
A day after threatening an armed response over an attack on Saudi Arabia oil facilities, President Donald Trump said Monday that he doesn't want war. When asked if Iran was responsible for missile and drone strikes this weekend on a major source of oil for the Saudis and the world, Trump said “it’s looking that way. ” Trump added that he doesn't want war with Iran – who has denied it was involved in the attack – but said the United States is "more prepared" for conflict than any country in history. "With all that being said, we’d certainly like to avoid it," Trump told reporters.
Trump said the U. S. doesn’t need Middle East oil production. Here's why the country is less dependent than ever on Saudi oil.
Energy prices surged worldwide Monday after the oil facility attack that disrupted more than 5% of the world's daily supply.
The Dow fell more than 100 points as oil prices jumped following the attack on Saudi supplies, raising the prospect of higher gas prices.
A deadly blast heard for miles
A hole is all that's left after a propane blast leveled a building in Farmington, Maine, leaving one firefighter dead and six people injured. Firefighters arrived to investigate the structure Monday after the smell of gas was detected, prompting the evacuation of the building. The blast was heard for miles around. The building, where a company served people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, was only a couple of weeks old, Farmington Town Selectman Scott Landry said. The blast had such force that only debris remained from the two-story building. "The building is gone," Landry said.

Purdue Pharma's billion-dollar bankruptcy deal
Pharmaceutical giant Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy late Sunday, an expected step in the Oxycontin maker's billion-dollar settlement to curb the opioid crisis it is accused of facilitating. To catch you up: Purdue Pharma is being sued by almost every state, and about half the states agreed to a settlement. The deal could be worth up to $12 billion over time. Why dissent? Some lawyers say the proposed payouts, even if they are made, won't be enough to fund needed opioid mitigation efforts. Will Purdue Pharma survive? Sort of. The company could operate with profits used to pay for the settlement, or the the judge could order it to be sold.
Trump: Kavanaugh is the one 'being assaulted'
Democrats called for Brett Kavanaugh's impeachment, but the president stood firm in his support of controversial Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a report published Saturday, The New York Times resurfaced claims of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. Trump disagrees on the victim in the situation, tweeting Monday, "The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh. " Since publishing the report, the Times clarified part of the story, which is based on a forthcoming book, regarding "an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. " In an editor's note, the Times said the female student declined to be interviewed and does not recall the incident.

Will the real 'Corn Pop' please stand up?
Yes, "Corn Pop" is a real person. This weekend, a 2017 clip of presidential candidate Joe Biden recalling his time as a Wilmington, Delaware, lifeguard in the 1960s went viral. In Wilmington, where the pool he worked at as a college student was being named after him, Biden told the story of Corn Pop. "Corn Pop was a bad dude," Biden said. "And he ran a bunch of bad boys. " The story ended in words exchanged, straight razors, an apology and Corn Pop walking away. The two-minute clip made many people wonder on Twitter who Corn Pop is and if the incident actually occurred. In short, William L. Morris was very much a real person.

Democratic Presidential Candidates Call For Kavanaugh's Impeachment

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) - Several Democratic presidential candidates have lined up to call for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a new, uninvestigated allegation of sexual impropriety when he was in college.
Kavanaugh was confirmed last October after emotional hearings in the Senate over a sexual assault allegation from his high school years. The New York Times now reports that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University and that the FBI did not investigate the claim.
The latest claim mirrors one offered during Kavanaugh's confirmation process by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party.
The Times said that the female student in the latest claim declined to be interviewed and that friends said she doesn't recall the episode. The newspaper said Sunday in an editor's note that an earlier version of its story didn't include that information. None of the Democratic candidates publicly adjusted his or her position on Kavanaugh after the newspaper published the editor's note and updated the story.
When Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, he denied all allegations of impropriety.
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said after the Times report that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people." She tweeted: "He must be impeached."
A 2020 rival, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, tweeted that "Confirmation is not exoneration, and these newest revelations are disturbing. Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke asserted in a tweeted, "We know he lied under oath. He should be impeached." He accused the GOP-run Senate of forcing the FBI "to rush its investigation to save his nomination."
Their comments followed similar ones from Julian Castro, a former U.S. housing secretary, on Saturday night. "It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath," he tweeted. "He should be impeached and Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont didn't refer to impeachment by name in a tweet Sunday, but he said he would "support any appropriate constitutional mechanism" to hold Kavanaugh "accountable."
Later Sunday, Sen. Cory Booker tweeted: "This new allegation and additional corroborating evidence adds to a long list of reasons why Brett Kavanaugh should not be a Supreme Court justice. I stand with survivors and countless other Americans in calling for impeachment proceedings to begin."
Democrats control the House, which holds the power of impeachment. If the House took that route, a trial would take place in the Senate, where Republicans now have a majority, making it unlikely that Kavanaugh would be removed from office.
Trump, who fiercely defended Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation process, dismissed the latest allegation as "lies."
In a tweet Sunday, Trump said Kavanaugh "should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue." It wasn't immediately clear how the Justice Department could come to the justice's defense.
Trump added that they were "False Accusations without recrimination," and he claimed his accusers were seeking to influence Kavanaugh's opinions on the bench.

Texto completo: Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "should start suing people for libel" or the U.S. Justice Department "should come to his rescue," President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday, following a New York Times report detailing sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court last following a tumultuous Senate confirmation process in which women accused the judge of sexual misconduct during his time in high school and college.
"Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue," Trump tweeted Sunday morning. "The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!"
Trump also tweeted, "Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!"
The Times article, published Saturday, centered on Deborah Ramirez, a Kavanaugh accuser who said the judge had exposed himself to her during a drinking game while freshmen at Yale University. The Times story detailed further corroboration of the account, included another sexual misconduct claim, and noted that the FBI did not interview witnesses who said they could back up the claims.
Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, a Democratic candidate for president, tweeted Sunday that Kavanaugh should be impeached. "It's more clear than ever that Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath," Castro wrote, referencing the article. "He should be impeached. And Congress should review the failure of the Department of Justice to properly investigate the matter."
On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minnesota) said on ABC's "This Week" that she would need to review documents related to the government's investigations of Kavanaugh. "My concern here is that the process was a sham. I don't think you can look at impeachment hearings without getting the documents ... and the Attorney General is shielding documents."
But Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said on "This Week" that last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee "did what we should have done. We held a hearing, we -- we invited the principal witness to testify, we heard it, the American people heard it and at the end of the day, the American people made a judgment that -- that the evidence wasn't there, the corroboration wasn't there, and -- and I think this article just shows the obsession with the far left..."
Cruz said, "I bet you the next Democratic debate, they'll all be saying impeach Kavanaugh, impeach Trump. There's nobody they don't want to impeach. And at some point, they just have to let the anger go and recognize that the democratic process actually moves on. And I think it's time for them to do that."

Texto completo: There was a monumental moment at the Hootie & the Blowfish concert that wasn't something to be heard.
Instead, it was a message shared in four written words, projected some two stories high onto the screen behind the band on the Colonial Life Arena stage in Columbia.
"Greetings from South Carolina."
With a popular national tour this summer and new music this fall, Hootie & the Blowfish are, once again, sharing the spotlight with South Carolina. This is nothing new for the hometown heroes who never really left their hometown.
Even when "Cracked Rear View" sat atop the Billboard album charts, the foursome kept a band office in Columbia, just steps from the bars where they first played R.E.M. covers for free beer and loose change. They all lived in the tree-lined neighborhood just up the hill, too.
It was about 25 years ago that frontman Darius Rucker wore a Gamecocks hat as he accepted the group's Grammy for Best New Artist. And here he was last week, wearing yet another University of South Carolina cap as he belted out bluesy, roots-rock melodies for the first of three sold-out crowds at the school's arena.
This sort of state ambassadorship goes beyond the stage. The easygoing pop-rockers have starred in a Myrtle Beach tourism summer TV spot this year, and Rucker penned a Charleston guide for September's Golf magazine.
The tour T-shirts feature a graphic that blends the stars and stripes with South Carolina's sabal palmetto and crescent moon.
Hootie's America is South Carolina.
Last week's concerts — just a couple miles from the dorms where guitarist Mark Bryan first heard Rucker's rich baritone bouncing off the concrete walls — are a grand finale. These are the last headlining dates in the band's 44-city summer U.S. tour in honor of the 25th anniversary of "Cracked Rear View."
A new album, the first in a decade, is slated for a November release.
The shows sold like it was 1994. The group, made up of four friends from the University of South Carolina, sold out two nights at Madison Square Garden. They packed the Hollywood Bowl. Most dates on the tour were sold out or close to selling out.
In Columbia, fans quickly snatched up all the seats for the originally planned Friday show at the 18,000-seat arena. Promoters then added Thursday's sold-out appearance. They fit in another show Wednesday night, which — you guessed it — also sold out.
These are Hootie & the Blowfish's first ticketed shows here in 18 years.
All of these tickets and tour dates also add up to another accomplishment: The band is introducing a new generation to a certain slice of South Carolina culture, one feel-good four-minute ditty at a time.
In Columbia, that looked like the father and son standing on their feet with the first notes of "Hannah Jane." The mother and daughter who swayed to "Hold My Hand."
Another mother held the hands of her children as they walked the hallways of the arena. Both wore small neon shirts proclaiming, "This is my first concert."
The media mea culpa The anniversary has also prompted the generation that was around the first time Hootie & the Blowfish headlined arenas to rethink the band's legacy.
The band's reputations have been damaged, for decades, by the intense backlash that followed the massive success of the debut album. Subsequent albums fizzled, but the band played on, just for mostly half-full concert halls into the early 2000s.
They went on hiatus in 2008. Rucker pivoted toward a successful country solo career.
One woman addressed the backlash directly Wednesday night: She wore a shirt to the show that said, "I still like Hootie, (expletive)."
Elsewhere, tastemakers like The New York Times published a profile back in June titled, "Hootie & the Blowfish, Great American Rock Band (Yes, Really)." Esquire magazine took it a bit further with its "How Our Cruelty Killed Hootie and the Blowfish – and Damaged Our Souls." Consequence of Sound did a new review of "Cracked Rear View," noting there "wasn't a real miss on the album," celebrating its bright lyrics, muscular guitar riffs and sing-a-long hooks.
At the time, Hootie was "an alternative to the alternative," said Michael Miller, a former entertainment writer for The State. The music from decade-defining grunge acts like Nirvana and Pearl Jam was darker, more introspective, he said.
And then "this band from South Carolina came along with more uplifting, bright, positive songs," Miller said. "People connected with them."
Of course, no one knew it in 1994, but "Cracked Rear View" would be the last monster rock album of the age. And maybe ever, considering that people just don't consume music that way anymore, one CD purchase at a time at the local music shop.
The debut album sold 21 million copies, making it the ninth-highest selling album ever, according to the RIAA's Gold & Platinum Program ("Cracked Rear View" is tied with Garth Brooks' "Double Live").
It's the highest-ranked debut album and the only Southern entry in the top ten, too. (Garth Brooks was technically born in Oklahoma — more Western than Southern.)
Hootie & the Blowfish's name is listed in the history books now with the very bands they spent years covering, like Led Zeppelin.
SC, the fifth band member Miller covered Hootie in the early days, when they played rowdy sets for bars and frat parties, hoping for just enough gas money to get to the next gig. They matured in this process, Miller said. They discovered their own original sound that is a reflection of this region, too, blending gospel, R&B, country, roots-rock and Southern rock.
Miller watched how Columbia itself gave the group a boost as they marched toward massive success. "They were able to play a lot in Columbia," he said. "They could do it a good pace and not break the bank. They could afford to live here."
They made it big here, too, Miller noted. Unlike other South Carolina musical successes like R&B icon James Brown or jazz great Dizzy Gillespie, the members of Hootie & the Blowfish didn't leave the state to find their big break.
"There were very much devoted to this state and to this school, and they still are," said Miller, who wrote a book on the band called "Hootie!." "I think that's what endears them, especially to South Carolina. They are proud (to be from here)".
Miller can't think of another contemporary band as devoted to its home — or a home as devoted to one band.
South Carolina, it seems, was there as each new fan picked up the album or watched them on TV in 1990s, whether they realized it or not.
The album cover for "Cracked Rear View" features photographs shot around Columbia. The music videos for that album's singles were shot in old barns and mills just outside of town. When MTV Unplugged wanted to film a Hootie & the Blowfish episode, the group insisted they come to Columbia.
They convinced Willie Nelson to stage a version of his fundraising festival, Farm Aid, here.
It's not surprising that Columbia was host for the final night of U.S. shows Friday. But this will not be the end of the tour.
The European leg of Hootie & the Blowfish's tour will launch in October with a date in Dublin, Ireland.
Still, the message from the stage that night will be the same.
"Greetings from South Carolina."

Texto completo: When was America founded?
The New York Times is trying to "reframe" American history and its teaching by marking the introduction of African slaves into Virginia in 1619 as the year of our "true founding." This effort denigrates our shared history and ignores the full American story.
Nothing can negate or excuse the horror of slavery. As Abraham Lincoln said, "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong."
But focusing single-mindedly on the introduction of slavery in 1619, and the legacy of oppression and discrimination against African Americans that followed, ignores the reasons for hope that have driven generations of Americans. It disregards the fact that many of the original colonies were settled by individuals escaping religious persecution in Europe. And it ignores the fact that many who followed later also were fleeing oppression.
Worst of all, it relegates to the back seat of American history the true miracle of our country's founding, when citizens with varying backgrounds, interests, and philosophical and religious beliefs came together to create a new form of government never before seen. They came together not on prejudice or passion but on the self-evident truth proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence: That all people "are endowed by their Creator" with the same rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
For the first time in world history, a genuine conversation took place about establishing a government dedicated to liberty and justice. As Alexander Hamilton said, all other countries before America were the product of "accident and force"; only our country had a constitution created by "reflection and choice" of the people.
True, "we the people" did not include everyone at the time - but 1776 laid the foundation for such inclusion. Consider what happened to slavery during our founding. Under British rule, slavery was legal in every colony in 1775. When the Americans started to rule themselves, slavery came under attack. By 1808, the slave trade had been outlawed; slavery had been prohibited in the Northwest Territories; and slavery had been abolished or put on the path to extinction in eight of the original colonies.
In his fight against slavery, Lincoln looked back to 1776 for inspiration. In his 1863 Gettysburg Address, he reminded us that "four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal."
That same year, the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass echoed Lincoln's sentiments, declaring that "the Federal government was never, in its essence, anything but an anti-slavery government. If in its origin slavery had any relation to the government, it was only as the scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building was completed. There is in the Constitution no East, no West, no North, no South, no black, no white, no slave, no slaveholder; but all are citizens who are of American birth."
Martin Luther King Jr. agreed with Douglass and Lincoln, proclaiming 100 years later that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution gave African Americans a "promissory note" for freedom. Like Lincoln, King saw 1776 as a fount of hope and justice. He knew that the heart of the American story is not the oppression of some by others but freedom for all - and the struggle to attain it.
This is a history worth teaching.
There is clearly a need to teach the full story of America's founding and our tumultuous and sometimes bloody struggle to live up to its principles. But centering our story on 1619 instead of 1776 is just as misleading as ignoring slavery, creating a warped view of the America that we should all get to know.

Trump: Kavanaugh needs to be rescued New sexual misconduct allegation surfaces against justice

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump vigorously defended Brett Kavanaugh on Sunday following a new allegation of sexual misconduct during the Supreme Court justice's college years, as some leading Democratic presidential contenders raised fresh suspicions that Kavanaugh was untruthful during last year's Senate hearings leading to his confirmation to the high court.
In an early-morning tweet, Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to Kavanaugh's rescue," and accused critics of trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration. The president's angry ripostes came a day after The New York Times reported that a male former classmate at Yale had told the FBI about witnessing an episode similar to, but separate from, an already publicized account by a female classmate, Deborah Ramirez, who said an inebriated Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a Yale party in the 1980s.
The authors of The New York Times story said Kavanaugh did not speak to them about the newly reported allegation.
Many of the Democrats who want to challenge Trump in 2020 have frequently referred to the string of sexual-misconduct allegations against the president himself, but there has been little appetite for making the Kavanaugh case a major campaign talking point, in part because the episode was so polarizing. In the ensuing months, the president has often invoked the case at fiery rallies, insisting that Kavanaugh was the wronged party.
But with the campaign season now underway in earnest, the previous allegations, coupled with newly reported information, are again becoming part of the discourse.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California both called for impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he supported "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" being used against the newest justice.
Warren tweeted that the new allegation was "disturbing," adding: "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Harris declared on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people," and Sanders said on Twitter that he should never have been nominated.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who, like Harris, sits on the Judiciary Committee and is seeking the Democratic nomination, repeated her deep misgivings about Kavanaugh in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week," citing his judicial views on the power of the presidency as well as the past and current sexual misconduct allegations.
Backers of Trump and Kavanaugh quickly rallied to the defense of both men. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, also appearing on "This Week," said the newly surfaced allegation recalls the "shameful circus" of last year's hearings. He predicted at "the next Democratic debate, they'll all be saying impeach Kavanaugh, impeach Trump - there's nobody they don't want to impeach."
On Twitter, Trump blasted "Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media" for targeting Kavanaugh and "talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment."
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel." Trump also accused Kavanaugh critics of acting out of unhappiness over high court rulings.
"They are trying to influence his opinions," the president tweeted.
Many commentators, however, called the situation yet another troubling instance of the president seeking to politicize the Justice Department and federal law enforcement by calling on the department to intercede on Kavanaugh's behalf.
The New York Times article focused on Ramirez's student days and her account of a party at which Kavanaugh, then a freshman, "pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it." The story said the FBI had failed to interview witnesses who may have been able to provide corroborating testimony, and that the paper's 10-month investigation suggested there was evidence to support Ramirez's account.
The New York Times also disclosed a previously unreported allegation: "A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The article said Stier, who heads a nonprofit organization in Washington, has not come forward publicly with his account, but notified senators and the FBI at the time.
The authors of the Times story said Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about Stier's account, and the article said the FBI did not investigate his claim.

Sleepy Morning at a Weather Hub, Then a Trumpian Tempest

Texto completo: CALERA, Ala. -- It had been a sleepy Sunday morning in the National Weather Service's office outside of Birmingham. The hot temperatures in the forecast were not out of the ordinary for the waning days of summer. There was a faraway tropical storm that the office was keeping an eye on -- one with the name of Dorian -- but with each passing day, it seemed more likely to veer in a different direction.
Then, out of nowhere, there came a flurry.
It was incoming phone calls from Alabamians energized about Hurricane Dorian, suddenly confused and worried about whether they were in the path of the giant Caribbean storm. At one point, the few people on duty were all answering calls at the same time.
In response to the alarm, one employee dashed off a short message to the office's 50,000 Twitter followers that reaffirmed what the latest models were saying: Alabama had little to worry about.
A far more alarmist forecast had gone out 20 minutes before on an account with a much, much larger reach. Alabama and other states, @realDonaldTrump had warned, would likely be hit "harder than anticipated."
The contrasting tweets set off a surprising clash that has stretched on for weeks, pitting top officials in the Trump administration against a small office of government weather experts -- a group better equipped to forecast the path of tornadoes than the trajectory of a prickly president's ire.
President Trump has gone so far as to press his top aides to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service, effectively reverse the local forecasters. An unsigned statement by the agency that seemed to back Mr. Trump over its own employees deepened the controversy.
The sequence of events cast an unwanted spotlight on the National Weather Service office in Central Alabama, where the forecasters occasionally fire up a barbecue in the backyard for collegial get-togethers and rarely discuss politics at their desks.
Until now, the office's tight-knit staff of about 25 has offered little insight about what transpired that day and the fallout. In interviews with The New York Times, employees stood behind the tweet, which remains on the office's Twitter feed. The person who wrote it declined through an intermediary to discuss the flap, but co-workers, expressing unity, argued that it had come from every last one of them.
They described the stressful aftermath, during which managers called staff members at home to help them deal with the pressure. A top official at the National Weather Service, they said, brought pizza to the office to temper their feeling of being under siege.
"You try to navigate these tricky waters that science people are not used to navigating," said Kevin Laws, the office's science and operations officer, who added that some employees were worried about how long the controversy would drag on and how many people it would sweep up. "What do you do in situations like this?"
Several forecasters said the employee who sent the tweet hadn't even been aware of Mr. Trump's post and had simply reacted to an influx of calls from the public.
"We don't monitor the president's tweets," said Michael Garrison, who manages the office's data on rainfall and temperatures and is the local steward for the National Weather Service Employees Organization. "Up until this point, it has nothing to do with what we do."
While Mr. Trump won Alabama with 62 percent of the vote back in 2016, Mr. Garrison said politics are not a "hot-button topic" in the office, which he said has a "good mix of Republicans and Democrats."
Mr. Garrison and his colleagues said that the post -- which was also shared on Facebook -- was not motivated by politics, and that the employee who sent it felt badly that it brought unwanted attention on the office.
That Sunday was a typical weekend shift at the office, a light brown, one-story building on Weather Vane Road next to the county airport. Forecasters headed to work expecting a few questions about Dorian, which seemed less relevant to the area than coming hot temperatures. The office had published a series of cautious tweets about the storm in the days before, but they all pointed to it having little impact on the area.
"The forecast track for #Dorian continues to shift a bit farther east," the office posted on Aug. 31, the day before Mr. Trump would weigh in with a forecast of his own. "If this track verifies, we'll be looking at dry conditions here in Central AL."
On the weekends, the office is generally staffed with just a few people, who answer the phones, monitor the weather, issue forecasts for pilots and post regular updates on social media.
Then the president weighed in with his weather update.
"It just started this big blitz," said Mr. Garrison, an employee since 2002. "We were just caught in the crossfire."
Some in the office have felt bewildered.
Chris Darden, the office's meteorologist-in-charge, posted to his personal Facebook account that the past days had been the "most confusing and disheartening" of his career.
One meteorologist in the Birmingham office tweeted that he was "crawling out from under this bus" on the day NOAA issued the unsigned statement that many forecasters saw as a challenge to the Weather Service.
The next night, a senior meteorologist changed his Facebook profile picture to the agency's logo and included a message: "NWS Birmingham Strong!"
The Central Alabama outpost, one of 122 field offices across the country, is responsible for warnings and forecasts in 39 counties, some of which have been hit in recent years by deadly tornadoes.
The last time the Birmingham office made national news was when it was praised for issuing a tornado warning a full 12 minutes before a twister swept in. That was considered significant lead time and was credited with saving lives, even though the storm killed 23 people. For generations, Central Alabamians have relied on the office, which is one of three in the state. (Another office, in Tallahassee, Fla., covers five Alabama counties.)
"Of all the government agencies out there, they are the ones I believe in," said Russell Thomas, who helps coordinate the efforts of the Alabama Emergency Response Team, a volunteer group that assists the office during bad weather.
As the office has tried to stay focused on coming storms, it has had to contend with a sustained campaign by Mr. Trump to back up the merits of his Twitter post, which has been widely ridiculed for being misleading, based on out-of-date information and ultimately incorrect.
Forecasters originally predicted that Hurricane Dorian's effects could reach Alabama, but by the time Mr. Trump said the state could feel its effects, projections showed the storm headed up the East Coast. Even so, in the Oval Office days later, Mr. Trump showed reporters a blown-up map of the storm's predicted path, its route extended slightly into southeast Alabama with a black marker.
The Times reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump had pressed his aides to intervene with NOAA officials and have the agency "clarify" its forecasters' position. That prompted Mick Mulvaney, his chief of staff, to call Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary. Mr. Ross then warned NOAA's acting administrator that top agency employees could be fired if the situation were not addressed. Mr. Ross's spokesman had denied he threatened to fire anyone.
At a weather conference in Huntsville last week, the National Weather Service director forcefully defended the Birmingham office, asking its members to stand for a round of applause.
"Let me be clear. The Birmingham office did this to stop public panic, to ensure public safety -- the same goal that all the National Weather Service offices were working toward at that time," said Louis W. Uccellini, the director.
The next day, Neil Jacobs, the director of NOAA, struck a diplomatic tone in a speech at the conference, thanking the Birmingham office while praising the Trump administration as "committed to the important mission of weather forecasting." He would later praise the office's efforts in an all-staff email.
Outside the ballroom where Dr. Jacobs addressed the forecasters, Mr. Laws, the science and operations officer, was ready to get back to dealing with actual storms.
"The next tornado outbreak's right around the corner," he said.

Texto completo: A photo circulating on social media shows former President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office meeting with a group of men in turbans and, in a Twitter post that includes the photo, the caption reads: "NeverTrumpers, a president meeting with the Taliban, this is horrific!" A Facebook post of the photo falsely claims, "Ronald Reagan meets with the Taliban. ‘These gentlemen are the moral equivalents of America’s Founding Fathers’ — Ronald Reagan, 1985."
The item is untrue on many levels, said PolitiFact.com.
The Taliban didn’t form until the mid 1990s, years after Reagan was out of office. The photo wasn’t taken in 1985, and Reagan never compared the group to the Founding Fathers. The photo is from a Feb. 2, 1983, meeting between the president and Afghan freedom fighters to discuss Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan, PolitiFact said. The quote was likely taken from a Reagan speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 1985, PolitiFact said. Reagan was talking about Nicaraguan rebels when he said, "I’ve spoken recently of the freedom fighters of Nicaragua. You know the truth about them. You know who they’re fighting and why. They are the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance."
The Twitter post, which showed up after President Donald Trump recently announced he had called off a meeting with the Taliban, has been shared more than 1,700 times, PolitiFact said.
Harris didn’t sue Exxon as California AG Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, during a recent climate town hall broadcast on CNN, told viewers she would fight big oil companies that "profit off of harmful behaviors."
Moderator Erin Burnett asked the California senator how she would fight.
"Would you sue them? Sue Exxon Mobil?" Burnett said.
Harris claimed, "I have sued Exxon Mobil."
That statement falls short of the truth, according to PolitiFact.com.
In 2016, when Harris was California’s attorney general, her office investigated Exxon over allegations the organization lied about the risk to its business from climate change, PolitiFact said. But there is no public record and nothing her campaign could provide to show she filed a lawsuit.
"(Harris) launched an investigation into Exxon," campaign spokesman Ian Sams told PolitiFact.
In fact checks other media did on the subject, The New York Times said, "An investigation, yes. A lawsuit, no." CNN said, "Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil."
Cinderella’s Castle not dismantled for hurricane A photo showing the spires being removed from the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, has been shared hundreds of times on social media.
A caption with the photo reads, "BREAKING: Workers have begun removing spires of Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom ahead of Hurricane Dorian."
The image has been flagged by Facebook as part of its effort to combat false news and misinformation, according to PolitiFact.com.
"It’s just another iteration of a long-running hoax about Florida hurricanes," PolitiFact said.
In the false photo, a crane appears to be lifting a spire off its base and another spire is completely gone. However, in the original photo, the crane is in the same position while it was reportedly being used to remove holiday lights, PolitiFact said. Both spires are intact. In the altered photo, it appears someone cloned the blue sky and placed it over part of one spire and completely removed the other spire from the picture.
Disney World told PolitiFact on Sept. 4 that the theme park would not dismantle the castle in preparation of Hurricane Dorian.
According to PolitiFact, Snopes.com debunked this story in October 2017, but it can be traced back as far as 1997 to a Chicago Tribune story headlined "25 secrets of the Magic Kingdom," which aimed to dispel a rumor that the castle could be taken apart and said the castle is built to withstand hurricane winds.

Texto completo: In search of something good to read? USA TODAY's Barbara VanDenburgh scopes out the shelves for this week's hottest new book releases.
1. "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The feminist dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale" (1985) gets a sequel at long last. Atwood says of the book, "Dear Readers: Everything you've ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we've been living in."
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "'The Testaments' is worthy of the literary classic it continues."
2. "The Institute" by Stephen King (Scribner, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: Twelve-year-old genius Luke Ellis is whisked away in the middle of the night and taken to the Institute, where psychic kids are being held captive to save the world.
The buzz: USA TODAY gave the book in a review, saying, "King leans into the theme of 'great events' happening with the smallest of decisions as well as the world-changing power of togetherness. And in that case, it's a frequent lesson he extols that never gets old."
3. "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America" by James Poniewozik (Liveright, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The New York Times TV critic examines the history of television and American media to explain how Trump mastered the medium to win his base and become our 45th president.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "This intelligent eye-opener belongs on the small shelf of valuable books that help explain how Trump created his base."
4. "The Education of an Idealist" by Samantha Power (Dey Street, nonfiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: The Pulitzer Prize-winning Irish-American diplomat and human rights advocate traces her journey from immigrant to war correspondent to presidential Cabinet official in a revealing memoir.
The buzz: A starred review from Kirkus Reviews says, "Power's vibrant prose, exuberant storytelling, and deep insights into human nature make for a page-turning memoir."
5. "After the Flood" by Kassandra Montag (William Morrow, fiction, on sale Sept. 10) What it's about: In this dystopian adventure novel set in a water-logged world altered by climate change, a mother embarks on a perilous voyage to rescue her kidnapped daughter.
The buzz: "Anchored by a complicated, compelling heroine, this gripping, speculative, high-seas adventure is impossible to put down," says Booklist.

Trump's fuzzy and often-repeated stories surrounding the 9/11 attacks

Texto completo: "I vividly remember when I first heard the news. I was sitting at home watching a major business television show. Early that morning, Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric, was about to be interviewed, when all of a sudden they cut away. At first there were different reports. 'It was a boiler fire,' but I knew that boilers aren't at the top of a building. 'It was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World.' Nobody really knew what happened. There was great confusion. I was looking out of a window from a building in Midtown Manhattan directly at the World Trade Center when I saw a second plane at a tremendous speed go into the second tower. It was then that I realized the world was going to change."
- President Trump, remarks at the Pentagon on the 18th anniversary of 9/11, Sept. 11, 2019

President Trump has told various versions of this story, of seeing the second jet hit the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He usually says he was in Trump Tower, which is four miles from where the World Trade Center was, though in his most recent remarks, he says he was in "a building in Midtown Manhattan" after apparently being at home (Trump Tower) when the first plane struck.
Certainly, from his vantage point in Trump Tower, he would have seen smoke billowing from the World Trade Center, but a full view might have been obscured by the Empire State Building. (We found a photo of the view downtown from the apartment directly below Trump's apartment, and the Empire State Building is dominant.)
The first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, hit 1 World Trade Center just before 8:47 a.m.; the second plane hit 2 World Trade Center at 9:03, 16 minutes later.
In his first interview on the day of the attacks, with New Jersey station WWOR, Trump did not mention seeing the second plane. He instead referenced an explosion that he said he saw from his office: "I have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center and I saw this huge explosion. I was with a group of people. I really couldn't believe it."
Rockefeller Center, a few blocks south of Trump Tower, with a clear view of the twin towers, certainly offered a view of the second plane hitting the tower. One of the most vivid videos of the impact was shot with a telephoto lens from the top of Rockefeller Center.
Trump, in 2015, also suggested at a campaign rally that he watched people jump from the buildings: "I have a window in my apartment that specifically was aimed at the World Trade Center because of the beauty of the whole downtown Manhattan. And I watched as people jumped, and I watched the second plane come in."
To be fair, in this instance he doesn't directly say he saw people jumping, but at another campaign rally he was more explicit: "Many people jumped and I witnessed it, I watched that. . . . I watched those people jump and I watched the second plane hit. I saw the second plane hit the building and I said, 'Wow, that's unbelievable.' "
Interestingly, in his WWOR interview, Trump says: "I have somebody who was down there who witnessed at least 10 people jumping out of the building from 70 and 80 stories up in the air." He does not say he personally witnessed people jumping out of the buildings.
So the most likely explanation is that Trump saw the explosion of the second plane and heard about the jumpers, as he recounted in his first interview. But over time, he's made the story even grander.
As Trump controversies go, whether he saw the second plane or just the explosion of the second plane is relatively minor. Here's a roundup of Trump claims regarding 9/11 that are clearly false.

His building downtown was now the tallest
"40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest - and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second tallest. And now it's the tallest."
- Trump, interview with WWOR, Sept. 11, 2001
This was an odd claim to make in the midst of tragedy, but it was also wrong. As our colleague Philip Bump documented in 2018, Trump's building was not the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan at the time. It was 25 feet shorter than 70 Pine Street, a block to the east.
"There was a period during which Trump's was the tallest building in Lower Manhattan, but it wasn't immediately before the construction of the World Trade Center in the 1970s," Bump wrote. "It was for about two years in the 1930s, well before Trump owned it - or was born."

He predicted Osama bin Laden
"I predicted Osama bin Laden . . . was coming in to do damage. . . . In my book, I predicted terrorism. I can feel it, like I can feel good location in real estate."
- Trump, in a speech during the 2016 campaign, Nov. 16, 2015
In various speeches and interviews, Trump claimed that two years before the 9/11 attacks, he warned that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a threat - was going to "do damage" to the United States - and even predicted the rise of terrorism.
This was based on one vague reference to bin Laden in a book he issued in January 2000. Even if his claim were true, Trump would have been echoing predictions of experts, news organizations and bin Laden himself, who in media interviews indicated that he planned to attack the United States.
Here's a 1999 CNN headline: "Bin Laden feared to be planning terrorist attack." The article started: "U.S. officials fear that suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden 'may be in the final stages' of planning an attack against the United States."
Trump earned Four Pinocchios for this claim.

He watched thousands of Muslims cheer as the towers came down
"I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down."
- Trump, at a campaign rally, Nov. 21, 2015
This is one of Trump's most notorious claims. An extensive examination of news clips and video archives turned up next to nothing. A professor had conducted extensive research into rumors of such jubilation and said it was possible that maybe six to 12 teenagers had something akin to a celebration on the morning of 9/11 in Paterson, N.J., but they quickly dispersed.
An MTV clip eventually was unearthed - some Trump supporters said it was evidence of the cheering Muslims - and it turned out that a high school senior was quoted as saying she had seen a group of kids acting up in front of the Paterson courthouse, banging on trash cans and shouting. She does not say they were Middle Eastern or Arab.
Trump earned Four Pinocchios.

He spent 'a lot of time' at Ground Zero
Trump has often suggested that he was at the center of the cleanup effort, but no evidence has emerged to support that claim. A newspaper report placed him near the scene on Sept. 14, 2001, talking on a cellphone, and a photo of him was taken on Sept. 18 outside the New York Stock Exchange. But an extensive New York Times examination of this claim found no one who could remember him playing any role in the cleanup or even supplying any workers.
Nevertheless, in his comments marking the 18th anniversary, Trump said: "Soon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could."

Texto completo: The Democratic National Committee will host its Ohio debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, just outside Columbus, on Oct. 15 and possibly a second night, using the location to highlight one of the state's blue-trending suburbs that will be pivotal in the 2020 presidential election.

The DNC's announcement ended speculation the event might be held in smaller cities, such as Dayton or Youngstown, to draw attention to issues facing those communities. Dayton was the site of a mass shooting last month that renewed a focus on gun control, while Youngstown has been reshaped by the closure of the General Motors' Lordstown Assembly Plant.

But in the end it was Ohio's capital that essentially won the draw. Otterbein is a half an hour from downtown Columbus. It's also where former Republican governor and current CNN commentator John Kasich has an office; Mr. Kasich was named a senior fellow at the small liberal arts college at the end of his term.

The Ohio Democratic Party described Westerville as a suburb that has trended blue over the past six years, using the debate's location to underscore a trend they said they hope will keep it competitive in 2020.

What we've seen in the suburbs of Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland and other cities mirrors what has happened in places like Harris County, Texas, and Orange County, California - suburban voters, particularly women, are backing Democratic candidates in response to the broken promises and toxic agenda of Donald Trump, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said.

Trump is under water in Ohio - his net approval rating here has dropped 19 percentage points since he took office - and a primary cause is that suburban voters are fleeing the Republican Party in droves.

On Twitter, some pundits were perplexed by the choice of Westerville.

Interesting choice by Dems to have the debate in Westerville (northern Columbus suburbs). To be clear, I don't think debate location matters electorally, but that specific part of the state is an important growth area for Dems if they are to make up their losses elsewhere, said Cleveland native Kyle Kondik, managing editor of the election forecasting site Sabato's Crystal Ball.

A memo released by the state party Friday cites declining votes for Republicans in several Ohio suburbs, including Westerville, since 2012.

In the 2018 midterms, Democrats picked up six Ohio House seats in suburban Columbus and northeast Ohio, though the gain did little to dent the GOP's supermajority in the General Assembly.

The suburban counties that flipped from supporting President Barack Obama to President Trump - the ones where independent voters were swayed to vote for a Republican in 2016 - are mostly clustered in northern Ohio, and include Wood, Ottawa, Erie, and Sandusky counties.

Mr. Trump won Ohio by 8 percentage points in 2016, followed by a GOP sweep in the 2018 midterms, leading some observers to question whether Ohio is permanently red.

The Ohio Republican Party indicated it doesn't view a debate being held in an important swing state as a threat.

The 2020 Democratic candidates can debate in Ohio all they want, but Ohioans have made it clear that their radical ideas are not welcome here. President Trump's pro-growth policies have created a booming economy, and in 2016 we flipped traditionally blue counties red. President Trump won Ohio by 8 points and we are still feeling that momentum thanks to the President's leadership. The Democrats' radical agendas, policies that will only result in higher taxes on the middle class, simply don't resonate here.

The moderators next month are CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett, and New York Times National Editor Marc Lacey. The fourth presidential primary debate is being co-hosted by CNN and the New York Times.

Baffert: Justify's positive test came from contaminated food

Texto completo: Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert denied giving 2018 Triple Crown winning horse Justify a banned substance that caused a positive test prior to last year’s Kentucky Derby and blamed the result on contaminated food.
Baffert said Thursday that he “unequivocally” rejects the implication he’d give Justify or any other horse scopolamine, which the colt tested positive for after winning the Santa Anita Derby in April 2018.
The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for the substance and that the California Horse Racing Board did not adequately investigate the matter. Justify was allowed to continue racing and won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes to become the 13th Triple Crown winner in history.
“Damn shame this great horse, connections and me have to be put through all this,” Baffert said in a text message to The Associated Press. “It was obvious environmental contamination. It’s been a known problem in California.”
California Horse Racing Board equine medical director Rick Arthur told the AP that the amount of scopolamine in Justify’s blood was “minuscule” and that based on his findings he recommended the case not be prosecuted.
Scopolamine, also known as hyoscine, can be used to treat motion sickness in humans and in limited equine cases can relieve intestinal spasms, though it can be toxic to horses. Scopolamine, which has been nationally downgraded from a class 3 to a class 4 level substance in horse racing, can come from jimson weed that grows wild in California. The Association of Racing Commissioners International’s Uniform Classification of Foreign Substances guidelines say class 4 drugs “comprise primarily therapeutic medications routinely used in racehorses (that) may influence performance but generally have a more limited ability to do so.”
Arthur said seven horses from four different trainers at Santa Anita were found to have some level of scopolamine or atropine in their systems during the period when Justify tested positive and he recommended that the two cases that crossed the threshold – Justify and another – be dismissed.
“It was a conclusion certainly of the executive staff that that was the appropriate and correct way to handle the case,” said Arthur, who is equine medical director at the veterinary school at the University of California at Davis, and is assigned to but not paid by the California Horse Racing Board. “I’m the primary adviser on drug testing to the board, and my opinion is it would have no pharmacological effect.”
After Baffert called on racing officials in Kentucky, Maryland and New York to release Justify’s test results, each one said everything came back negative.
“Neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential positive tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby,” Churchill Downs Racetrack President Kevin Flanery said. “We do know that all pre- and post-race tests for 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.”
The Maryland Jockey Club said it was “informed that all of those tests came back negative for any illicit substance or for the overages of any prohibited medication” for Justify and the other horses who ran in the 2018 Preakness.
New York State Gaming Commission director of communications Brad Maione told the AP all of Justify’s blood and urine samples tested by the New York Equine Drug Testing and Research Laboratory at the Belmont Stakes came back clear “with no evidence of impermissible medication.” Veterinary records from the 2018 Belmont showed Justify was treated orally for dehydration the day before the race. Justify did not run another race after winning the Triple Crown and was retired. Baffert trained the only two Triple Crown winners in the past three decades: Justify in 2018 and American Pharoah in 2015.
“Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time,” Baffert said in a statement. “I am proud to stand by his record and my own.”
Baffert’s attorney, W. Craig Robertson, wrote a letter addressed to the Times defending Baffert and saying the California racing board did the correct thing by not pursuing a lengthy investigation.
While defending his own actions, Baffert said he had no input into or influence on decisions made by the California board, which came under fire for treating this situation differently from past precedent. Upon notification of the positive test result, Robertson told the board to deal with him and not Baffert from that point forward.
“Given all the foregoing facts, I was confident that Mr. Baffert would ultimately prevail if the CHRB pursued the matter,” Robertson wrote.
“This left the CHRB with two choices – either pursue a frivolous case that had no merit at great taxpayer expense, or exercise reason and common sense and decide to take no further action.”

Thousands of Poor Patients Face Lawsuits From Nonprofit Hospitals That Trap Them in Debt

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.
Over the past few months, several hospitals have announced major changes to their financial assistance policies, including curtailing the number of lawsuits they file against low-income patients unable to pay their medical bills.
Investigative reports have spurred the moves, and they prompted criticism from a top federal official.
“We are learning the lengths to which certain not-for-profit hospitals go to collect the full list price from uninsured patients,” Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told board members of the American Hospital Association on Tuesday, according to published remarks. “This is unacceptable. Hospitals must be paid for their work, but it’s actions like these that have led to calls for a complete Washington takeover of the entire health care system.”
In June, ProPublica published a story with MLK50 on the Memphis, Tennessee-based nonprofit hospital system Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare. It brought more than 8,300 lawsuits against patients, including dozens against its own employees, for unpaid medical bills over five years. In thousands of cases, the hospital attempted to garnish defendants’ paychecks to collect the debt.
After our investigation, the hospital temporarily suspended its legal actions and announced a review. That resulted in the hospital raising its workers’ wages, expanding its financial assistance policy and announcing that it would not sue its lowest-income patients. “We were humbled,” the hospital’s CEO, Michael Ugwueke, told reporters.
The same month, NPR reported that Virginia’s nonprofit Mary Washington Hospital was suing more patients for unpaid medical bills than any hospital in the state. Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, and fellow researchers had documented 20,000 lawsuits filed by Virginia hospitals in 2017 alone. The research team found that nonprofit hospitals more frequently garnished wages than their public and for-profit peers.
In mid-August, The Oklahoman reported that dozens of hospitals across the state had filed more than 22,250 suits against former patients since 2016. Saint Francis Health System, a nonprofit that includes eight hospitals, filed the most lawsuits in the three-year span.
In the first week of September, The New York Times reported that Carlsbad Medical Center in New Mexico had sued 3,000 of its patients since 2015. That report was also based on findings from Makary, who just published the book “The Price We Pay: What Broke American Health Care — and How to Fix It.”
And this week, Kaiser Health News and The Washington Post chronicled how Virginia’s state-run University of Virginia Health System sued patients more than 36,000 times over a six-year span.
There is no federal law mandating that nonprofit hospitals provide a specific amount of charity care, nor is there readily accessible data measuring how aggressively each hospital pursues patients for unpaid bills. But consumer advocates say the revelations in recent coverage on hospitals’ litigation practices are troubling.
“It’s dismaying to see how common it is,” said Jenifer Bosco, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center who helped craft a Model Medical Debt Protection Act.
Nearly half of the nation’s 6,200 hospitals are nonprofits, meaning they are exempt from paying most local, state and federal taxes in return for providing community benefits.
But the issue of nonprofit hospitals engaging in aggressive debt collection practices that push the very communities they are designed to assist into poverty isn’t new.
In 2014, ProPublica reported on a small Missouri hospital that filed 11,000 lawsuits over a five-year span. In response, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, opened an investigation, and the hospital forgave the debts owed by thousands of former patients.
In 2003, The Wall Street Journal detailed how Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut had pursued a patient’s widow to pay off his late wife’s 20-year-old medical bills. The hospital canceled the debt following the article.

Texto completo: Let’s suspend reality for a nanosecond.
Let’s say that a horse can test positive as soon as he crosses the finish line, and the trainer has no recourse to call for a second test, and the results can flash on the board right then and there.
Justify wins and then is disqualified at the 2018 Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018.
Since Justify had only run two races previously, trainer Bob Baffert has to scramble to find a race that allows enough points to qualify for the Kentucky Derby on May 5.
That doesn’t work, and Justify has to wait until the Preakness. He’s able to run there because only eight horses have entered a field that can stretch to 14. He wins the Preakness, then the Belmont.
The stud fees for Justify still don’t project high enough for his many owners. So he returns in 2019. He wins the Pegasus at Gulfstream Park, and he runs away with the Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
By now Justify has built the renown that lures the civilian fan into the seats. In a triumphant return, he dominates the Breeders’ Cup Classic at Santa Anita and is carried into the barn, amid rose petals and trumpets, to denote his early retirement.
But reality is the enemy of thoroughbred racing, as we know. This week brought an asterisk to Justify’s Triple Crown run that can’t be erased from the procreation station, unfairly or not.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Justify tested positive for scopolamine, which reduces motion sickness in human beings, after he won the Santa Anita Derby by three lengths. The machinery of drug testing did not allow a positive test to return before the Kentucky Derby. Therefore, Justify ran and won and did not test positive there. The same was true of the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes.
No one at Churchill Downs knew of the test, but a track spokesman said Justify and the others were tested prior to the race. Baffert, as is his right, asked for another test, and when those results were positive, the California Horse Racing Board basically tabled the issue, and the public never knew until the news was fit to print.
The Times quoted Dr. Rick Sams, the director of LGC Science, a drug testing lab in Lexington, Ky. Sams said that Justify had 300 nanograms per milliliter of scopolamine in his system, five times the legal limit. Such a reading, Sams said, could make Justify’s breathing more efficient and therefore enhance his performance.
Never mind that Justify somehow went unbeaten without this surfeit of nanograms.
The CHRB decided that Justify took in scopolamine through Jimson weed, which sometimes gets into the feed or the straw. It decided Justify did not get the drug through Buscopan, which trainers sometimes use to fend off colic.
Horses in three other barns also ingested scopolamine during this period. Dr. Rick Arthur, the CHRB’s equine medical director, found that Justify and those others had atropine in their system. Buscopan does not contain both atropine and scopolamine, but Jimson weed does.
That means Justify likely suffered “environmental contamination,” similar to Canelo Alvarez’s suspension for eating steroid-riddled steaks. That prompted what the French might call a “spectacle de matieres fecales” in boxing. It dissipated, too.
The CHRB has not disqualified a horse for scopolamine in 12 years. In 1994 five trainers were fined, including Mark Hennig, whose Lady Blessington won the Buena Vista Handicap. An administrative law judge rescinded those fines, but the disqualifications and the forfeiture of the purse stood.
What’s a nanogram? It’s a billionth of a gram. We get numbed by the billions that are thrown around. If one were to log a billion miles by following the equator, one would encircle the earth 40,000 times. If one traveled from the Earth to Saturn when they are closest together, one would have to travel 256 million more miles to reach a billion.
It’s difficult to accept that 240 more billionths of a gram would decide a horse race.
But it’s easier to understand why people think Baffert, the face or at least the hair of the sport, is being coddled.
One rule should pass immediately: No California Horse Racing Board member should have any business connection with anyone in the sport, the way Madeline Auerbach owns a horse with Stronach Group COO Tim Ritvo, the way Chuck Winner had an interest in horses Baffert trained. You don’t need test results for that. It’s California government. Divestiture is the least it should demand.
That would help the sport get from beyond repair to beyond reproach. Granted, it sometimes seems a billion-mile trip.

After Shaking Trees, Warren Claims Grass Roots

Texto completo: I like Elizabeth Warren. I like her a lot. Too bad she’s a hypocrite.
I think Warren, D-Mass., has been a great senator, and her work in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was terrific. The CFPB is the best protection that ordinary Americans have from financial institutions that prey on them. In fact, I like her so much that when she ran for Senate in 2018, I co-chaired a couple of fundraisers for her and donated a combined $4,500 to her campaign.
Shortly after announcing her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, Warren said she would shun high-dollar fundraising events. “That means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Warren wrote in an email to supporters.
Now, Warren has every right to make that pledge even if she had obtained significant contributions from donors in the past. Doing that didn’t make her a hypocrite. But there are two other reasons why the description applies.
First, because she transferred $10.4 million from her Senate reelection campaign to her presidential campaign fund. More than $6 million came in contributions of $1,000 and up, as The New York Times recently noted. The senator appears to be trying to have it both ways - get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donors and running a grass-roots campaign, while using money obtained from those donors in 2018.
The $10.4 million gave Warren a substantial head start in building a presidential-campaign staff and doing other things for which money is essential. If she weren’t being hypocritical, she would have taken only the dollars raised in smaller increments from her Senate race and transferred those into her presidential account.
Second, Warren attacked former Vice President Joe Biden for holding a kickoff fundraiser in Philadelphia in April, which she criticized as “a swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors” in an email to supporters the next day.
Well, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in “swanky” locations.
Warren didn’t seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful. I co-chaired one of the events for the senator and received a glowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.
It seemed odd to some of us who gave her money that Warren was experiencing an epiphany less than 12 months later. It’s one thing to fashion a campaign that relies on grass-roots fundraising, but it’s another to go out of your way to characterize as power-brokers and influence peddlers the very people whose support you previously have courted.
Warren is not the first person to be hypocritical about fundraising. Barack Obama, whom I consider one of the greatest presidents in my lifetime, vowed not to take any money from the political action committees of Wall Street firms in his 2008 campaign. At the same time, his campaign took in millions of dollars in contributions from individuals who worked for Wall Street firms.
But the news media basically gave Obama a free ride and didn’t point out the blatant hypocrisy of trying to win credit for shunning contributions from Wall Street firms while taking tons of money from people who work for those same Wall Street firms. Politics can make people do peculiar things.
I also take issue with the notion, raised by Warren in her criticism of the Biden fundraiser in April, that people who give the maximum allowable individual donation of $2,800 to a presidential candidate are doing so because they believe it will get them a federal job, win their business a federal contract or even gain special access.
Donors who give $2,800 for the most part are doing so because they believe strongly that the candidate would make a great leader, or maybe they believe in the candidate’s values or policies on the important issues challenging the country.
Are there some people who give or raise money in presidential campaigns with ulterior motives? Sure, but I’m confident that the crowd at the Biden fundraiser gave money to him for the same reason I did. We believe that he will be the best person to lead the country, to restore the United States’ moral leadership in the world, to get things done in Washington, to create opportunity for all Americans and to protect the nation’s most vulnerable citizens.
So, despite my feelings, Elizabeth, if you’re reading this and you win the Democratic nomination, I will be happy to support you and will campaign for you with all my heart. And, by the way, Philadelphia has a lot more swanky restaurants that you haven’t seen yet.

Another mass shooting, a nation on tenterhooks

Texto completo: In 1879, on the road leading into Dodge City, there stood a sign. "The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited," it said.
As recounted in the book "Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America" by Adam Winkler, the gun control ordinance was the first law passed when the city was organized in 1873. Nor was Dodge unique. Many other western towns, Wichita and Tombstone among them, had similar laws.
The statutes don't seem to have been particularly controversial. Though Dodge City was, by reputation if not always in actual fact, one of the toughest and most lawless places on the frontier, cowboys had no problem walking unarmed into its brothels and saloons. Yet in 2019, many of us feel the need to take guns into Walmart.
Worse, they're allowed to do so under permissive "open carry" laws which, in most states, give people the right to bear handguns and even long guns in public. But now Walmart is fighting back. Sort of.
Last week, the giant retailer announced that it was "respectfully requesting" that people not bring guns into its stores. This, on the heels of last month's racist mass shooting - 22 people died - at a Walmart in El Paso. Other companies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit. The New York Times notes that still more companies - Starbucks, Target and Chipotle among them - already had such policies in place. Most used the same word Walmart did to couch their requests: "respectfully."
To say "it's about time" is to understate. Years of living in the shadow of massacres has left us a nation on tenterhooks, 330 million people all sharing the same case of PTSD. One recalls the panicked stampede in Times Square last month when motorcycles backfired. One observes that children are being sent back to school this year with bulletproof backpacks. And one is glad businesses are willing to "respectfully request."
But they must do more.
The idea of a cowboy walking without his revolver down the wooden sidewalks of Tombstone stands in rather pointed contrast to that of some accountant waiting in line at a suburban Starbucks with an AR-15 slung across his back. One can imagine no more vivid illustration of the absurdist dystopia this country has become as a result of the NRA, its GOP toadies and their conviction that all people must have access to all guns in all places at all times.
If you're sitting in a movie theater or standing in a checkout line and some stranger walks by carrying a military grade rifle, do you feel safer or do you start looking for the exit? The answer is obvious: this is not a scenario that instills a sense of security. One would have to be drunk, stupid or Republican to think otherwise.
So it's good to see American business taking a stand American lawmakers won't, the marketplace of commerce reaching a consensus the marketplace of ideas can't. That said, this polite pleading is not enough. Asked about Walmart's policy, even David Amad, a gun rights activist in Texas, told the Times, "They are ducking the issue."
Which they are. Walmart and other retailers seek a path of least resistance that will relieve them of the responsibility of taking a stand. But no such path exists: sides must be chosen and lines must be drawn, because this is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. And death and death and death. As a private entity, Walmart, like CVS, Starbucks and Kroger, can simply say, Do not bring guns into our stores. They have that power and they must use it. The majority of us who want gun sanity in this land must require them to. They've made their "respectful request."
We must answer with an impatient demand.

Texto completo: After teasing theme parks fans online months ago, SeaWorld Orlando finally revealed Thursday what's under construction: A bright orange, family-friendly roller coaster called Ice Breaker that goes both forward and backward up to 52 mph on a 90-second trip.
Opening this spring, the ride will be the park's first launch coaster, hurling riders four times over the course of the ride on 2,750 feet of track, said Brian Andrelczyk, the park's vice president of design and engineering.
Amid Disney World's and Universal's recent expansions, it was the smaller SeaWorld's turn for the spotlight Thursday. The company announced Ice Breaker as part of a trio of new rides also coming to Florida next year.
Tampa Bay Busch Gardens is transforming its dormant wooden coaster Gwazi into a 206-feet-tall hybrid coaster - one with a steel track that still has wood supports. The revamped ride will take passengers upside down three times, whizzing up to 76 mph when it opens this spring, according to the company. One vertical drop goes 91 degrees down.
Andrelczyk called Iron Gwazi the tallest, steepest and fastest hybrid roller coaster in the world.
Adventure Island, the water park across the street from Busch Gardens, also is getting a new thrill waterslide.
SeaWorld hasn't built a new roller coaster in Orlando since Mako debuted in June 2016.
What makes Ice Breaker unique is that it's only a few feet above the ground.
Hardcore roller coaster enthusiast Martin Lewison, whose love of riding more than 2,000 thrill rides across the world earned him a write-up in The New York Times, said an attraction low to the ground like Ice Breaker gives the illusion of traveling much faster.
"The truth is you can have really exciting coasters that aren't that high or go that fast," Lewison said. "I love coasters that hug the terrain."
One of the thrills during Ice Breaker will be a backward launch from a steep 93-foot tall spike that's banked at 100 degrees - "So it's beyond vertical," Andrelczyk said.
The four launch points will alternate between shooting riders backward and forward as the train gains speed throughout the ride. The launches aren't built straight but have curves "so you're going to get that little pop of air time on every single one of those launches as you go back and forth," Andrelczyk said.
Ice Breaker is being built by Baltimore-based Premier Rides, which has built similar launch coasters, including Tigris at Busch Gardens.
Ice Breaker's minimum height requirement is 48 inches, less than the required 54 inches to ride Mako and the other major coasters at SeaWorld.
"This could be a kid's first launch coaster," Andrelczyk said. "It's something the family can enjoy, but it is not going to disappoint thrill-seekers, either."
It makes sense for SeaWorld to diversify by adding a more "intermediate" coaster, something in between the weightlessness-inducing Mako and the Sesame Street land kid's coaster, Lewison said.
The ride is being built in a narrow footprint in the Wild Arctic plaza, which also plays into the ride's ice theme, although no animals will be featured on the ride or the queue. It's a departure for SeaWorld, which has long juggled the contradictions of being loved for its animals by fans while being criticized by activists for keeping them in captivity. Focusing on thrill rides moves SeaWorld further away from that.
SeaWorld's leaders have vowed to update their parks more frequently by adding new events and rides after years passed between attractions opening up.
Within a six month-period in Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando launched the raft ride Infinity Falls and turned around to open the kid-friendly Sesame Street land in late March. The accompanying waterpark Aquatica Orlando also opened two new water rides in two years.
Still, the theme park competition in Central Florida is only becoming more ferocious as Universal and Disney pour in multi-billion dollar investments. Andrelczyk declined to give a cost estimate for Ice Breaker but called it significant.
Universal's leaders recently announced they are building a new theme park, a destination also planned with hotels, restaurants and shops, near the Orange County Convention Center.
"We are going to make the largest investment we've ever made in a park," said Brian Roberts, CEO of Comcast Corp., which owns Universal theme parks, at a news conference last month.

Texto completo: " Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles " is a documentary about the creation and legacy of the stage musical "Fiddler on the Roof."

At area theaters. Contains some mature thematic elements and disturbing images. 92 minutes.

A 17-year-old misfit finds solace in an underground Mexico City nightclub in " This Is Not Berlin. " Set in 1986, and inspired by the experiences of filmmaker Hari Sama, the movie is a coming-of-age story set against a backdrop of drugs, art, sexual liberation and the music of Joy Division. According to the New York Times, "As much as 'This Is Not Berlin' advocates throwing caution to the wind, it is, narratively speaking, ultimately a tad conservative." Unrated.

In the documentary " Vision Portraits ," filmmaker Rodney Evans contemplates what the loss of his eyesight means to him as an artist. In addition, he profiles visually impaired artists: photographer John Dugdale, dancer Kayla Hamilton and writer Ryan Knighton. The Hollywood Reporter writes: "The content of the film is endlessly thought-provoking and will have artists and their admirers spinning out for days on questions about literal and figurative artistic vision. What does it mean to see and what does it mean to have vision? What does it mean to make art when you can't see what you've made?" Unrated. At Landmark's West End Cinema. 78 minutes.

Texto completo: A Shelby County woman alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that New England Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown sexually assaulted and raped her in 2017 and 2018.
In the complaint, which was filed in the Southern District of Florida and obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night, Britney Taylor, 28, claims that Brown sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions in 2017 while she was helping to train him for an upcoming NFL season. She alleges he raped her on May 20, 2018.
The complaint also states Taylor was born and raised in Memphis, began her college gymnastics career at Central Michigan and later transferred to LSU. Taylor's bio on the LSU athletics website lists her as a graduate of Ridgeway High School.
Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement that his client had a "consensual personal relationship" with Taylor but denied raping or sexually assaulting her.
"Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," Heitner wrote in the statement. "He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false allegations."
The NFL and the Patriots did not immediately respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday night.
In a statement released through her attorney, David Haas, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult."
"As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision. I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault. Speaking out removes the shame that I have felt for the past year and places it on the person responsible for my rape. I will cooperate with the NFL and any other agencies; however, at this time, I respectfully request that the media please respect my privacy."
USA TODAY does not typically identify victims of sexual assault unless they decide to come forward publicly, as Taylor has in this case.
In a statement released to The New York Times, which first reported the existence of the lawsuit, Taylor said the decision to come forward was "incredibly difficult" and that she will cooperate with the NFL in any forthcoming investigation.
According to the complaint, Taylor opened a gymnastics training center (Taylor'ed Gymnastics Training Center) in 2016 in Memphis.
Brown joined the Patriots this week after a tumultuous training camp with the Oakland Raiders. He was traded from Pittsburgh to Oakland in March but never played a game for the Raiders. He wasn't eligible to play with New England against his former team Sunday, after the Raiders released him Saturday. But Brown is expected to be available for Week 2.
The allegations filed Tuesday stem from incidents in 2017 and 2018, and explain Taylor and Brown's relationship even earlier.
According to the lawsuit, Taylor and Brown were student athletes at Central Michigan in 2010 and met through the Fellowship for Christian Athletes, when they were paired as bible study partners. Brown played football for the school while Taylor competed as a gymnast.
They reconnected in 2017 when Brown asked Taylor to train him. She flew to him in Pittsburgh and Florida for the sessions. In June 2017, the lawsuit says, she was staying at his home for a session when he walked into the bathroom she was in and exposed himself to her.
He then "grabbed and kissed her without her consent," the lawsuit says, before she "pushed him away and immediately left the room." Another time in 2017, Brown masturbated behind her and ejaculated on her, the lawsuit says, with messages that Brown allegedly sent her about the incident.
The suit says the two cut off contact until 2018, when in April they agreed to restart a working relationship with conditions. Brown's attorney Heitner says the lapse in communication resulted from Brown refusing to invest $1.6 million in Taylor's business project.
The lawsuit alleges that on May 20, 2018, Brown pinned Taylor down and penetrated her even as she shouted "no" and "stop." Heitner said "any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual" and that Taylor traveled to Florida and returned at 2 a.m. to Brown's residence 10 days after the alleged assault.
According to the lawsuit, Taylor contacted an anti-sexual harassment organization in January and described the incident.
Heitner followed up his initial statement with a tweet Tuesday night.
"Antonio Brown will leave no stone unturned and will aggressively defend himself, including exercising all of his rights in countersuits," Heitner tweeted.

Jamelle Bouie: The necessary radicalism of Bernie Sanders

Texto completo: You may have missed it, but late last month, Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign released the senator’s proposal for revitalizing the American labor movement. If passed into law, his Workplace Democracy Plan would end “at will” employment (employers could no longer dismiss employees for any reason without warning), institute industrywide “sectional” bargaining (versus organizing at individual companies) and curtail “right to work” laws.
Those measures alone would give unions a little room to breathe in an otherwise anti-labor atmosphere. More than half of Americans have a favorable view of unions, but in 2018 only 10.5% of workers were unionized. And nearly three years into his presidency, Donald Trump has been unabashedly hostile toward labor, even after selling himself as a tribune of the “forgotten man.”
But the most important parts of Sanders’ plan have to do with striking and other powerful levers. He would give federal employees the right to strike and ban the permanent replacement of any striking workers. He would also end the prohibition on secondary boycotts, which keeps workers from pressuring “neutral” employers — like suppliers and other service providers — in the course of an action against their “primary” employer. This prohibition closes an important avenue for collaboration among workers. Lifting the restriction would open new paths for collective action.
This push to enhance workers’ freedom to strike is more consequential than it might look at first glance. Conflict was the engine of labor reform in the 1930s. And mass strikes and picketing, in particular, pushed the federal government to act.
In 1934, the historian Irving Bernstein writes in “The Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,” “there were 1856 work stoppages involving 1,470,000 workers, by far the highest count in both categories in many years.” In that year, nearly five years into the Great Depression, “labor’s mood was despair compounded with hope.”
The despair was self-explanatory. The hope came from the growing conviction that workers had to act of their own accord — to, Bernstein wrote, “take matters into their own hands and demonstrate their collective power to recalcitrant employers through the strike.” And strike they did.
In Toledo, Ohio, for example, workers demanding union recognition organized a strike against Electric Auto-Lite, an automobile parts manufacturer, and its related firms. When Auto-Lite and its partners hired strikebreakers and kept their factories open, the union worked with the American Workers Party, a small, radical political party that organized jobless workers to keep them from breaking strikes.
Together, unionists and labor radicals led mass pickets against Auto-Lite. Thousands of workers, employed and unemployed, surrounded the plant. Fighting broke out when a strikebreaker attacked a striker. The police and company guards attacked, and a battle ensued. The National Guard arrived and the fighting continued. In their attempt to break the siege and evacuate the strikebreakers, troops killed two strikers and injured more than a dozen others. After a week of violence, Auto-Lite agreed to close the factory. The next month, after additional mass protests and the threat of a general strike, the company backed down, recognizing the union and agreeing to rehire the strikers.
Mass pickets appeared elsewhere in the country. Late that summer, the United Textile Workers of America called a national strike, demanding union recognition and a shorter workweek. Hundreds of thousands of workers formed pickets at mills as far north as Maine and as far south as Alabama. “This strike now in progress,” Joseph Shaplen reported in The New York Times, “is obviously a mass movement.”
The strike was most active in North Carolina and South Carolina, where strikers closed hundreds of plants. “Moving with the speed and force of a mechanized army,” Shaplen wrote in a Sept. 4, 1934, report, “thousands of pickets in trucks and automobiles scurried the countryside in the Carolinas, visiting mill towns and villages and compelling the closing of the plants.” He continued: “The growing mass character of the picketing operations is rapidly assuming the appearance of military efficiency and precision and is something entirely new in the history of American labor struggles.”
Mill owners and management responded with private militiamen and armed strikebreakers, all backed by state and local authorities. A police officer killed a picketer in Augusta, Georgia. In one South Carolina mill town, sheriff’s deputies fired on picketers, killing seven. In Rhode Island, armed state troopers — equipped with machine guns — drove a crowd of 600 strikers from a mill that refused to close. And during a confrontation in Burlington, North Carolina, soldiers bayoneted several picketers.
The strike ended when the Board of Inquiry for the Cotton Textile Industry, established by President Franklin Roosevelt at the start of the strike, issued its report, which recommended a federal study of work conditions and pay. The union announced victory and ordered the strikers back to work. The strikers themselves felt differently. “Mill workers were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for claiming a victory, calling off the strike, and putting their faith in government boards, when the employers had conceded nothing,” the historian Jeremy Brecher notes in “Strike!”
The year saw many other monumental strikes. After San Francisco police killed four workers in a confrontation with striking longshoremen and their allies, local unions announced a general strike. More than 150,000 workers left their jobs, paralyzing the city. And in Minneapolis, tens of thousands of workers walked off the job in solidarity with a Teamsters strike in the city.
It was this widespread labor struggle — as well as an overwhelming victory for New Deal Democrats in the 1934 midterms — that created new space for political action in 1935. Sen. Robert Wagner of New York introduced a labor bill that would give workers “the right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.” Facing reelection and eager to shore up support from labor, Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act that summer.
We are not living in an era of mass unemployment and inescapable deprivation. But we’re also very far from broad prosperity. And if the past is any indication, achieving it will require agitation and conflict. Giving workers more freedom to organize and act might produce the confrontation that makes reform possible.
Indeed, Sanders could probably go further. Mass picketing has vanished from the arsenal of organized labor, dwindling in the 1950s and ’60s in the wake of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 — which put new restrictions on the power and activities of labor — and rendered ineffective by deindustrialization as well as legal prohibitions in the 1970s and ’80s. Conventional picketing is still around, but as the labor scholar Ahmed White notes, it “simply isn’t effective enough to give real substance to labor rights in this day and age.”
There is an opportunity, in other words, for Sanders or any other labor-friendly politician to give even more teeth to the right to strike, to dramatize exploitation through conflict and confrontation and to give labor the tools it needs to forge a path to a better world for people without the privileges of wealth or the power of capital.

Texto completo: The third overall Democratic debate airs tonight, with 10 candidates taking the stage to show why they'd be best to take on President Trump in the general election. Unlike previous rounds of debates, which spanned two nights, Thursday's event is one-night-only.
Here's a look at what to expect tonight.
When and where is the debate?
The debate will air tonight (Thursday, Sept. 12) from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. It's taking place at the Texas Southern University's Health & PE Center in Houston, Texas.
How can I watch it?
On cable, the debate will air live nationally on ABC and Univision (with a Spanish translation), and locally in Houston on KTRK-TV.
In addition to airing on television, the debate will also stream on several online platforms, including Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
What's the lineup?
Those taking part in the debate are (in alphabetical order):
- Former vice president Joe Biden
- Senator Cory Booker
- Mayor Pete Buttigieg
- Former HUD official Julián Castro
- Senator Kamala Harris
- Senator Amy Klobuchar
- Former congressman Beto O'Rourke
- Senator Bernie Sanders
- Senator Elizabeth Warren
- Businessman Andrew Yang
Podium order
So who is standing where? According to information sent by ABC in late August, the front-runners — Biden, Warren, and Sanders — will be clustered in the center.
What happened to the rest of the candidates?
In order to make the debate stage, those in the field of more than 20 candidates had to show at least 2 percent support in four qualifying polls and donations from at least 130,000 unique donors by a deadline in late August.
Among those who did not qualify: Marianne Williamson in August said she crossed the donor threshold to participate but did not receive the required support in polls.
An aggressive ad buy from   Tom Steyer   helped push him past the donor requirement, but he fell short by just one qualifying poll .
Prior to announcing just before the debate deadline  that she would drop out, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said she was close to receiving the required donors, but The New York Times reported that she needed three more polls.
Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard has the required donors and received up to 3 percent support in several early state polls, but only in two approved by the DNC, her campaign said in August.
According to fivethirtyeight.com, the remaining members of the field did not hit 2 percent in any approved polls prior to the deadline, nor did they hit the donor threshold. Those include Senator Michael Bennet, Governor Steve Bullock, Mayor Bill de Blasio, former congressman John Delaney, and Congressman Tim Ryan.
Who is moderating?
Chief anchor George Stephanopoulos, “World News Tonight" anchor and managing editor David Muir, ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis, and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos will moderate the debate.
What is the format?
Candidates will be allowed an opening statement, but not a closing statement. Candidates will get one minute and 15 seconds for answers, and 45 seconds for rebuttals.
What do recent national polls say about where the candidates stand?
Former vice president Joe Biden has held on to his lead among the crowded field of candidates, but he's lost some ground recently to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in national polls. The rest of the field remains stuck in the single digits.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Federal prosecutors recommended seeking criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the decision Thursday.
McCabe was fired from the FBI just before his retirement in March 2018 after the Justice Department's internal watchdog concluded that he improperly authorized a leak about a federal investigation into the Clinton Foundation in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. Investigators concluded that he displayed a lack of candor when asked about the leak.
The U. S. attorney in Washington, Jessie Liu, recommended moving forward with unspecified charges against McCabe, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to comment publicly. McCabe's lawyers appealed that decision to Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who rejected their request, one of the people said. McCabe's lawyers were informed of that decision Thursday.
The decision clears the way for prosecutors to ask a grand jury to indict McCabe, though it was unclear Thursday whether that would happen. Whether McCabe is indicted will be up to a federal grand jury in Washington.
The U. S. Attorney's Office in Washington declined to comment.
The recommendation that McCabe be charged is the latest fallout from the FBI's handling of investigations around the 2016 presidential election, when agents investigated both of the major-party candidates. Those investigations – into Russian meddling to help Trump win the presidency and Democrat Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server – inserted the FBI into the center of fraught political controversies.
Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe after a Justice Department Inspector General’s report found he misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal days before the election about an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. He was ousted days before he could begin collecting retirement benefits.
McCabe, who became acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, has been the target of the president's attacks. Trump accused law enforcement officials of partisan investigations of him, his campaign and his administration. Inquiries led to charges against a half-dozen of Trump's aides and advisers.
Trump applauded the decision to fire McCabe in March 2018, calling it "a great day for democracy. ” Trump called McCabe a "major sleazebag" and argued that his conduct was akin to treason for favoring Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in 2016.
The election-year investigations roiled the top ranks of the FBI. Internal investigators faulted McCabe and Comey for violating Justice Department rules in the final months of the campaign. Lower-level staffers were fired or reassigned.
The Justice Department announced Aug. 29 that Comey violated bureau policies for keeping private memos about his conversations with Trump, then having a friend describe the contents of one memo to The New York Times for a story. The department didn't charge Comey criminally.
McCabe's firing came after the inspector general investigated the information behind a Wall Street Journal story about the Clinton Foundation to determine whether it was an unauthorized leak and if so, who was the source. The story appeared online Oct. 30, 2016, and in print Oct. 31, which was a week after another story reported that McCabe terminated the foundation probe under pressure from the Justice Department.
Investigators determined that McCabe, to promote his impartiality, authorized associates to disclose a call Aug. 12 between McCabe and the principal associate deputy attorney general to The Wall Street Journal. The call effectively confirmed the existence of the Clinton Foundation investigation, which Comey refused to do.
The inspector general found McCabe “lacked candor” when he said he hadn't authorized the disclosure and didn't know who did while talking to Comey, when questioned under oath by FBI agents, then when questioned under oath by investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller.
McCabe filed a lawsuit in August challenging his dismissal, alleging that Justice Department officials demoted him in January 2018 and fired him two months later to cater to Trump’s “unlawful whims. ” McCabe's termination came after he had announced his intention to resign and days before his full retirement benefits would have set in.
Trump's political accusations against McCabe stemmed from his wife running unsuccessfully for state Senate as a Democrat in Virginia. Trump seized on contributions Jill McCabe received from a political action committee tied with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Clinton ally.
Trump said McCabe took “massive amounts of money” for his wife’s campaign.
Internal FBI documents stated that McCabe didn't oversee the Clinton investigation while his wife was running for office and that he didn't have a conflict of interest. McCabe argued in television interviews that top congressional leaders were notified about the counterintelligence inquiry into Russian influence on Trump's campaign and nobody objected.
The decision about McCabe comes amid several investigations of how the Justice Department and the FBI began inquiries into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Attorney General William Barr assigned one internal probe in May.
Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s review launched in March 2018 focuses on an FBI wiretap of Carter Page, a former policy adviser to Trump's campaign. The inspector general looked into whether the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, when it sought court-ordered surveillance of Page in late 2016. Horowitz examined the FBI's relationship and communication with Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was hired by a research firm working for Clinton's campaign and compiled a "dossier" alleging links between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Republicans complained that the FBI concealed its reliance on Steele's findings in the surveillance applications for Page. Copies of those applications released after USA TODAY and others sued showed investigators disclosed to judges that Steele sought information to "discredit" Trump and that investigators had broader suspicions about Page's ties to the Russian government.
Mueller took over the Russia investigation in May 2017 after Trump fired Comey. Mueller's report, released in April, detailed a "sweeping and systematic" effort by the Russian government to intercede in the election to help Trump win but "did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. ”

Looking at the campaign through Sanford’s looking glass

Resumen: The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons.

Texto completo: CHARLESTON, S.C. — Once upon a time, Mark Sanford might have been a contender, but there’s too much water under the bridges that stretch from this city of steeples to his erstwhile home on Sullivan’s Island.
The disgraced former South Carolina governor and congressman announced Sunday that he’s running against Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican nomination. The third challenger to toss his hat into the wishing well of magical thinking, Sanford says he plans to talk about the skyrocketing debt, tariffs, trade and tone. Perfect. That’ll ignite the crowds and knock the grand poobah of pomp and propaganda off his game.
You can just see it: The boyish Sanford — an itinerant stranger in his own strange land — going toe to toe with the swamp-menacing Trump. It would be worth the price of a ticket. Trump’s other two GOP opponents, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh, may as well grab one while they last.
Nevertheless, the buzz does what buzz does. In the days following Sanford’s announcement and a series of cable-TV appearances, you’d have thought the former governor were the deus ex machina of the GOP. Recent commentary from conservatives has been dripping with so much honey you don’t know whether to build a hive or kill the drones.
The narrative-shmarrative is that Sanford is an old-school Republican whose concerns are focused on a strong, bootstrap economy and, well, that’s about it so far. Also, BIG HEADLINE, he believes in climate change and legal immigration because, what life form other than Trump’s most fervent supporters doesn’t?
Further to Sanford’s coronation as GOP savior, according to Republican strategist Liz Mair writing Monday in The New York Times, he’s a bigger threat to Trump than his co-challengers because he was never a "Never Trumper." Unlike Walsh and Weld — a strong law firm name if things go awry, as surely they will — Sanford appears to be uninterested in making the race all about Trump, even though Trump’s anti-endorsement in 2018 led to Sanford’s congressional primary defeat.
Plus, wrote Mair, Sanford is more "nuanced." Perhaps she was thinking of the subtle differences between Argentina and the Appalachian Trail, where in 2009 the then-governor Sanford told everyone through a spokesperson that he’d be hiking for a few days but instead found himself in South America with his mistress?
Mair insists that the tryst that ended Sanford’s governorship, as well as his marriage, was "the least-scandalous scandal in modern political history" because, after all, he only had an "extramarital affair because he fell in love and got engaged to the woman."
This confection would be news to South Carolinians who were appalled by his deceit and repulsed by his weepy news conference to confess his sins. Such a cavalier dismissal of a family betrayal would also be news to ex-wife Jenny Sanford, who wrote a book, "Staying True" about it.
It is absolutely true that Sanford, 59, is a time-tested conservative on budgetary matters, as my Washington Post colleague Jennifer Rubin argued under the banner headline "Mark Sanford might be the Republicans’ last chance." No one can accuse him of being a fake conservative, she wrote.
Indeed, not. As governor, Sanford was such a budget cruncher that he brought two baby pigs, one under each arm, to the statehouse to make his point about — get it? — pork.
It is quite possible that most or many Americans don’t care what Sanford did in his personal life, but the nicknamed "Luv Guv’s" philandering meanderings were public matters by virtue of two facts: The highest-ranking official of the state lied about his whereabouts and was unreachable. He simply slipped the reins of government and followed his passion, which was concerned with "issues" having nothing to do with matters of state.
It’s not the economy, it’s character. Only someone as despicable as Donald Trump could make a man like Mark Sanford palatable. Sanford’s well-reasoned concerns about the unfathomable debt, his low-key, soft-spoken style and his cool Southern manner might have made him a terrific presidential candidate in another time, especially alongside his tough, accomplished wife and central-casting sons. But that time has passed.

Elizabeth Warren's hypocrisy

Texto completo: Ed Rendell, a Democrat, is the former governor of Pennsylvania.
I like Elizabeth Warren. I like her a lot. Too bad she's a hypocrite.
I think Warren (D-Mass.) has been a great senator, and her work in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was terrific. The CFPB is the best protection that ordinary Americans have from financial institutions that prey on them. In fact, I like her so much that when she ran for Senate in 2018, I co-chaired a couple of fundraisers for her and donated a combined $4,500 to her campaign.
Shortly after announcing her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in February, Warren said she would shun high-dollar fundraising events. "That means no fancy receptions or big money fundraisers only with people who can write the big checks," Warren wrote in an email to supporters.
Now, Warren has every right to make that pledge even if she had obtained significant contributions from donors in the past. Doing that didn't make her a hypocrite. But there are two other reasons why the description applies.
First, because she transferred $10.4 million from her Senate reelection campaign to her presidential campaign fund. More than $6 million came in contributions of $1,000 and up, as the New York Times recently noted. The senator appears to be trying to have it both ways - get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donors and running a grass-roots campaign, while at the same time using money obtained from those donors in 2018.
The $10.4 million gave Warren a substantial head start in building a presidential-campaign staff and doing other things for which money is essential. If she wasn't being hypocritical, she would have taken only the dollars raised in smaller increments from her Senate race and transferred those into her presidential account.
Second, Warren attacked former vice president Joe Biden for holding a kickoff fundraiser in Philadelphia in April, which she criticized as "a swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors" in an email to supporters the next day.
Well, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in "swanky" locations.
Warren didn't seem to have any trouble taking our money in 2018, but suddenly we were power brokers and influence peddlers in 2019. The year before, we were wonderful. I co-chaired one of the events for the senator and received a glowing, handwritten thank-you letter from her for my hard work.
It seemed odd to some of us who gave her money that Warren was experiencing an epiphany less than 12 months later. It's one thing to fashion a campaign that relies on grass-roots fundraising, but it's another to go out of your way to characterize as power-brokers and influence-peddlers the very people whose support you have previously courted.
Now, Warren is not the first person to have been hypocritical about fundraising. Barack Obama, whom I consider one of the greatest presidents in my lifetime, vowed not to take any money from the political action committees of Wall Street firms in his 2008 campaign. At the same time, his campaign took in millions of dollars in contributions from individuals who worked for Wall Street firms.
But the news media basically gave Obama a free ride and didn't point out the blatant hypocrisy of trying to win credit for shunning contributions from Wall Street firms while taking tons of money from people who work for those same Wall Street firms. Politics can make people do peculiar things.
I also take issue with the notion, raised by Warren in her criticism of the Biden fundraiser in April, that people who give the maximum allowable individual donation of $2,800 to a presidential candidate are doing so because they believe it will get them a federal job, win their business a federal contract or even gain special access.
Donors who give $2,800 for the most part are doing so because they believe strongly that the candidate would make a great leader, or maybe they believe in the candidate's values or policies on the important issues challenging the country.
Are there some people who give or raise money in presidential campaigns with ulterior motives? Sure, but I'm confident that the crowd at the Biden fundraiser gave money to him for the same reason I did. We believe that he will be the best person to lead the country, to restore the United States' moral leadership in the world, to get things done in Washington, to create opportunity for all Americans and to protect the nation's most vulnerable citizens.
So, despite my feelings, Elizabeth, if you're reading this and you win the Democratic nomination, I will be happy to support you and will campaign for you with all my heart. And, by the way, Philadelphia has a lot more swanky restaurants that you haven't seen yet.
The writer, a Democrat, is the former governor of Pennsylvania.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Texto completo: The order to disavow a National Weather Service tweet contradicting President Trump's claim that Hurricane Dorian could hit Alabama came from the White House.
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney instructed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to take action because he believed NWS forecasters in Birmingham went too far by saying the storm had no chance of impacting Alabama, according to the New York Times.
The controversy began on Sept. 1 when Trump tweeted that Alabama and other southeastern states "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." Twenty minutes later, the National Weather Service station in Birmingham appeared to issue a corrective tweet that said "Alabama will NOT see any impacts" from Dorian because it was projected by that time to remain too far east.
A report from the Washington Post said Mulvaney made a call to Ross after Trump complained about the issue and told staff to correct the NWS Birmingham tweet.
The Times previously reported that Ross called Neil Jacobs, the acting director of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, on Friday and threatened to fire top political staff in the scientific agency that his department oversees if they did not crack down on forecasters who contradicted Trump's warning to Alabama.
NOAA, the parent agency of NWS, released an unsigned statement later that day that condemned the Birmingham office for speaking in "absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time."
Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday did not issue the order to NOAA to issue a statement. “No, I never did that,” the president said. "I never did that. It’s a hoax by the media. That’s just fake news, right from the beginning, it was a fake story.”
A representative for Commerce Department told the Washington Examiner the Times report about Ross threatening NOAA was "false."
Jacobs also disputed the report during a speech on Tuesday.
“There is no pressure to change the way you communicate forecast risk into the future. No one’s job is under threat: not mine, not yours. The Weather Service team has my full support and the support of the department," Jacobs told a crowd of forecasters at a conference in Huntsville, Alabama.
Multiple investigations, including by the Commerce Department inspector general and Congress, are now underway examining possible violations of policy and ethics.

Leonard Pitts: ‘Respectfully request’ isn’t quite enough

Texto completo: In 1879, on the road leading into Dodge City, there stood a sign. “The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited,” it said.
As recounted in the book “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America” by Adam Winkler, the gun control ordinance was the first law passed when the city was organized in 1873. Nor was Dodge unique. Many other western towns, Wichita and Tombstone among them, had similar laws.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
The statutes don’t seem to have been particularly controversial. Though Dodge City was, by reputation if not always in actual fact, one of the toughest and most lawless places on the frontier, cowboys had no problem walking unarmed into its brothels and saloons. Yet in 2019, many of us feel the need to take guns into Walmart.
Worse, they’re allowed to do so under permissive “open carry” laws which, in most states, give people the right to bear handguns and even long guns in public. But now Walmart is fighting back. Sort of.
Last week, the giant retailer announced that it was “respectfully requesting” that people not bring guns into its stores. This, on the heels of last month’s racist mass shooting — 22 people died — at a Walmart in El Paso. Other companies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit. The New York Times notes that still more companies — Starbucks, Target and Chipotle among them — already had such policies in place. Most used the same word Walmart did to couch their requests: “respectfully.”
To say “it’s about time” is to understate. Years of living in the shadow of massacres has left us a nation on tenterhooks, 330 million people all sharing the same case of PTSD. One recalls the panicked stampede in Times Square last month when motorcycles backfired. One observes that children are being sent back to school this year with bulletproof backpacks. And one is glad businesses are willing to “respectfully request.”
But they must do more.
The idea of a cowboy walking without his revolver down the wooden sidewalks of Tombstone stands in rather pointed contrast to that of some accountant waiting in line at a suburban Starbucks with an AR-15 slung across his back. One can imagine no more vivid illustration of the absurdist dystopia this country has become as a result of the NRA, its GOP toadies and their conviction that all people must have access to all guns in all places at all times.
If you’re sitting in a movie theater or standing in a checkout line and some stranger walks by carrying a military grade rifle, do you feel safer or do you start looking for the exit? The answer is obvious: this is not a scenario that instills a sense of security. One would have to be drunk, stupid or Republican to think otherwise.
So it’s good to see American business taking a stand American lawmakers won’t, the marketplace of commerce reaching a consensus the marketplace of ideas can’t. That said, this polite pleading is not enough. Asked about Walmart’s policy, even David Amad, a gun rights activist in Texas, told the Times, “They are ducking the issue.”
Which they are. Walmart and other retailers seek a path of least resistance that will relieve them of the responsibility of taking a stand. But no such path exists: sides must be chosen and lines must be drawn, because this is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. And death and death and death. As a private entity, Walmart, like CVS, Starbucks and Kroger, can simply say, Do not bring guns into our stores. They have that power and they must use it. The majority of us who want gun sanity in this land must require them to. They’ve made their “respectful request.”
We must answer with an impatient demand.

For A Longer Life, Get Moving, Even A Little Bit

Texto completo: Men and women who move around throughout the day, even if they just stroll or clean the kitchen and do not formally exercise, are less likely to die prematurely than people who hardly ever leave their chairs, according to a new study of physical activity and mortality.
The study, the largest of its kind to date, finds that any activity, no matter how modest, can reduce mortality risks, with some of the greatest gains seen when people shift from being almost completely sedentary toward rising and ambling for even an extra hour each day.
By now, none of us should be surprised to hear that exercise and movement are good for us. Many studies show links between activity and longevity, with more moving almost always tied to longer life spans.
A limitation of these past studies, however, is that in many of them, researchers asked people how active they had been in recent days or weeks, and most of us cannot accurately report how much time we spent sitting or completing gentle, everyday activities like cooking and cleaning.
Some of those past studies, however, did equip people with activity trackers to objectively monitor their days. But most of those have tended to be small or focused only on men, women or older adults, making their results difficult to interpret for the general population.
So for the new study, published in August in the British Medical Journal, an international consortium of researchers combined and reanalyzed data from earlier studies that had provided volunteers with activity monitors. They wound up with data covering 36,383 middle-age or older men and women and divided them according to levels of activity. They found, to no one’s surprise, that the men and women who were the most active were the least likely to have died. That group’s risk of premature death was about 60% lower than for the men and women in the most-sedentary group.
More unexpected, people in the second-least-active group also were significantly less likely to have died than those in the least-active group, even though their activities consisted primarily of moseying, housecleaning, cooking or gardening.
Overall, the researchers found, someone’s chances of dying prematurely continued to drop the more he or she moved, up to a plateau at about 25 minutes per day of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, or 300 minutes a day of light, gentle activity. Beyond that point, people did not gain additional longevity benefits, although their risks of premature death did not rise either.

Make gazpacho to use late-summer veggies

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Harvey Weinstein's legal enablers; A new book reveals how his lawyers lost their moral way.

Texto completo: Honestly, I was not expecting to learn that two attorneys -- one a well-known champion of women, the other a pillar of the establishment -- would turn out to be the bad guys in the new book "She Said," by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times investigative reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein sex harassment and assault scandal in October 2017.
We already knew so much about the disgusting behavior that Weinstein inflicted on his employees, and on actresses who wanted to work for him, that the depraved details came as no surprise: the hotel room meetings, the bathrobes, the pleas for naked massages, the cajoling, the brute force, the threats of retaliation, the actual retaliation, the alleged rapes.
All of that is familiar territory now, nearly two years after the #MeToo movement was ignited by spectacular investigative journalism at a number of outlets, including the Los Angeles Times.

What did come as a shock is the way that attorneys Lisa Bloom, a champion of women's rights, and David Boies, who famously argued in favor of gay marriage, among other things, took up Weinstein's cause in brutal, compromising ways.
Was it only coincidence that Bloom's book on the Trayvon Martin case was going to be made into a miniseries by the Weinstein Co.? Or that Boies, according to Kantor and Twohey, was angling for a role in a Weinstein film for his actor daughter, Mary Regency?
I won't focus much on Boies, who, while representing the New York Times in legal cases, was simultaneously working to undermine the Times' investigation of Weinstein. (The New York Times fired him.)
But how can Bloom, who, like her mother, Gloria Allred, has carved a place in the legal world exacting justice for women who have been abused, harassed and discriminated against, have thrown herself off such a precipitous moral cliff?
A contrite Bloom, who declined my interview request, has tweeted her regret and described her involvement with Weinstein as "a colossal mistake."
Oh, Ms. Bloom, it wasn't just a mistake. It was a total, humiliating sellout.
::
Kantor and Twohey obtained a December 2016 pitch written by Bloom to Weinstein, outlining how the two of them, together, could undermine Weinstein's first public accuser, the actor Rose McGowan, who alleged that Weinstein had raped her in 1997 and had received a $100,000 settlement from him that included a nondisclosure agreement, or NDA.
McGowan was writing a memoir; Weinstein wanted to impede her. Or, failing that, destroy her.
"I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world because I have represented so many of them," wrote Bloom, who called McGowan "a disturbed pathological liar."
She recommended sending McGowan a cease-and-desist letter, and placing "an article re her becoming increasingly unglued, so that when someone Googles her this is what pops up and she is discredited."
In the memo obtained by Kantor and Twohey, Bloom, whose law firm is in Los Angeles, offered a six-point plan to paint Weinstein as a feminist committed to making the film world a better place for women to work. She suggested that she and Weinstein appear on TV together "in a pre-emptive interview where you talk about evolving on women's issues, prompted by the death of your mother, Trump pussy grabbing tape and maybe nasty unfounded hurtful rumors about you.... You should be the hero of the story, not the villain. This is very doable."
She advised Weinstein to set up a charitable foundation "focusing on gender equality in film, etc. Or establish the Weinstein Standards, which seek to have one-third of films directed by women or written by women, or passing the Bechdel test (two named female characters talk to each other about something besides a man), whatever."
Whatever?
::
Kantor and Twohey did not just set out to find out what happened, but how.
How was it possible that Weinstein, whose predations were an open secret in Hollywood, was able to get away with his contemptible behavior for so long?
They have created a damning portrait of a system that is designed to protect perpetrators by silencing victims while purporting to make them whole.
The system is built on sleazy tactics like those that Bloom suggested to Weinstein, of course.
But also with cash settlements that include the prolific use of extremely strict nondisclosure agreements. These agreements ostensibly provide confidentiality to women who may not want to go public with their accusations, but they also allow predators to keep preying without professional fallout, as long as their pockets are deep enough.
The headline on Kantor and Twohey's first, explosive New York Times story on Weinstein was not just about his harassment, but about that system that allowed him to do the same thing over and over again with no legal or professional consequence: "Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades."
Victims' attorneys may argue that NDAs offer essential protection to women, and usually net them higher settlements (of which the lawyers usually take 40%). But in practice, NDAs are invaluable tools for harassers.
"I really hate NDAs," said Oakland-based employment discrimination attorney Leslie Levy. "The ability to talk about what happened is critical to the healing process. The act of harassment or rape and assault is all about power. You leave the power in the perpetrator's hands when you allow him to gag the woman."
As Levy points out, a man who pays a million dollars to a woman he has assaulted is probably not going to go around blabbing about it.
And victims risk losing it all if they breathe a word to anyone.
One of Weinstein's victims, Rowena Chiu, told Kantor she felt she'd signed "a deal with the devil."
In California in 2017, state Sen. Connie Leyva had considered introducing a law that would strictly limit confidentiality clauses in sexual harassment and assault settlements. In "She Said," Kantor and Twohey report that Allred threatened to lobby hard against the bill.
"With Allred's threat," they wrote, "an effort to reform the system and protect victims' voices died before it was ever introduced."
A year later, however, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a bill that would ban NDAs in sexual harassment, assault and sex discrimination settlements.
Both Allred and Bloom gave the law their tepid approval. Allred said it could make getting maximum settlements for victims more difficult. Bloom acknowledged that the law "is definitely a step in the right direction."
So maybe it will have the effect of lowering the amounts of money harassers are willing to pay to make claims go away. Maybe it will force women into litigation, which can be expensive and painful.
But it will remove their gags, let them talk about their traumas.
And maybe -- just maybe -- it will discourage powerful men from taking advantage of their far less powerful underlings.
And hasn't that been the point of the #MeToo movement all along?

Texto completo: HUNTSVILLE, Ala. - The acting administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defended his agency at a weather conference Tuesday, as controversy swirls over how agency officials responded to President Trump's inaccurate claim that Alabama would be hit hard by Hurricane Dorian.
Neil Jacobs defended the agency's unusual, unsigned statement released Friday, which backed Trump's Sept. 1 claim about Alabama and admonished the National Weather Service's Birmingham office for countering Trump's remark.
"I have the utmost respect for what you do, because I understand how difficult numerical weather prediction is and how even more complicated conveying risk to the public is," Jacobs said. "The purpose of the NOAA statement was to clarify the technical aspects of the potential impacts of Dorian. What it did not say, however, is that we understand and fully support the good intent of the Birmingham weather office, which was to calm fears and support public safety."
Jacobs also said that Dorian had in fact threatened Alabama. "At one point Alabama was in the mix, as was the rest of the Southeast," he said. However, that was not the case when Trump posted his tweet.
The NOAA statement was in part a result of pressure from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in an early-morning phone call to Jacobs on Friday, according to three people with knowledge of the call. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss such communication.
According to one federal official with knowledge of the matter, Ross wanted NOAA to issue a statement backing Trump's Alabama contention, even if the state was outside the official forecast cone. NOAA is a Commerce Department agency. Ross's involvement in the statement was first reported by the New York Times.
According to two additional people, Jacobs initially resisted issuing such a statement and tried to block the inclusion of a paragraph that called out the Birmingham Weather Service office for a tweet that many perceived as correcting Trump. The acting NOAA head lost both arguments.
Trump has maintained that he was correct in saying Alabama was at direct risk of significant impacts from Dorian. At the time of his first tweet mentioning Alabama, the National Weather Service forecast guidance showed a very small risk (about 5 percent) of tropical-storm-force winds for a small portion of the state. However, Alabama was not in the storm forecast track or the "cone of uncertainty" from the National Hurricane Center, which showed Hurricane Dorian skirting the East Coast, far from Alabama.
The Weather Service's Birmingham office quickly set the record straight after Trump's tweet, stating that Alabama "would NOT see any impacts" from the storm. Agency Director Louis Uccellini said Monday that the Birmingham office was responding to an influx of calls from concerned residents after the president's tweet. He said Alabama forecasters did not know about Trump's tweet and were not responding to it.
Jacobs, in his Tuesday speech, disputed some of the reporting on the administration's role in getting NOAA to correct its forecast.
"There is no pressure to change the way you communicate forecast risk into the future. No one's job is under threat: not mine, not yours," Jacobs said. "The Weather Service team has my full support and the support of the department."
Jacobs took the stage one day after Uccellini broke ranks with NOAA leadership, issuing a strong defense of his employees, particularly those at the Birmingham forecast office, during a speech at the same conference.
"They did what any office would do," Uccellini told the crowd of hundreds of meteorologists. "With an emphasis they deemed essential, they shut down what they thought were rumors. They quickly acted to reassure their partners, the media and the public - with strong language - that there was no threat."
Also Tuesday, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) wrote to the Commerce Department inspector general's office seeking an investigation into possible violations of NOAA's scientific integrity policy.
"I am deeply troubled that NOAA is politicizing weather prediction critical for the protection of life and property in contravention of internal operations services and policy directives," Shaheen wrote. She is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee's panel on commerce, justice and science, which oversees NOAA's budget.
She wrote that the NOAA statement was "released . . . to defend the President's position, while ignoring the best available science."

Immigration confusion awaits weary Bahamians

Texto completo: U.S. officials scrambled Monday to clarify immigration requirements for those fleeing the islands ravaged by Hurricane Dorian after about 100 Bahamian refugees were told to get off of a ferry headed to Fort Lauderdale.
But Bahamian immigration in the post-Dorian era remained as clear as mud.
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott blasted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s murky policy in the morning, followed by a rambling — and sometimes contradictory — White House news conference by the agency’s interim commissioner, Matt Morgan.
But by Monday evening, Scott issued a new statement praising Morgan for allowing “Bahamians fleeing destruction on the islands to temporarily come to the United States,” a contention not backed by the commissioner’s comments.
And nothing was said about numerous Bahamians who remain stuck because their passports washed out to sea during Dorian’s devastating storm surge.
Morgan did say that the United States would expedite the immigration process by waiving fees and other measures and put more immigration resources in the Bahamas.
"That doesn't mean we do this with a blind eye,” Morgan said. “We still have to balance the humanitarian need and assistance of those that need it versus the safety of this country."
President Donald Trump had his own take, contradicting Morgan. “Everybody needs totally proper documentation,” Trump said Monday on the South Lawn of the White House. “The Bahamas has some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren’t supposed to be there. I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members and some very, very bad drug dealers.”
Hurricane-weary residents have made their way to South Florida in the last week by cruise ship, ferry and small aircraft since the Category 5 tempest made landfall Sept. 1. Many have said they plan only to regroup, possibly leave young children with family here, and head back home to rebuild.
The death toll stood at 45 Monday as hazmat teams searched for bodies. Hundreds of people still are missing and feared dead. About 70,000 Bahamians remained homeless.
’Proceed to disembark’
A snapshot of what can go wrong on the immigration front was captured when hundreds of Bahamians boarded the Fort Lauderdale-bound ferry.
The refugees were told they could come to the United States through a screening process that required only a Bahamian passport and proof they had no criminal record.
The Bahamians stood in the suffocating heat, jockeying to get a spot on the ferry.
But just as the ferry was to leave, an announcement blared over the intercom: “Please, all passengers that don’t have U.S. visas, please proceed to disembark.”
Brian Entin, an investigative reporter with Miami TV station WSVN, broke the story that quickly made headlines nationwide. He tweeted out an interview with refugee Renard Oliver.
“At the last minute like this, it’s kind of disappointing,” said Oliver, who held his infant daughter. “It’s hurtful because I’m watching my daughter cry, but it is what it is.”
Customs said the decision to remove the passengers was on the ferry operator, Balearia Caribbean. The agency said in a statement that it asked the operator to coordinate with U.S. government and Bahamian officials.
In a statement released late Monday, Balearia apologized “for the hardship and inconvenience experienced by the 119 passengers.”
“We boarded these passengers with the understanding that they could travel to the United States without visas, only to later having been advised that in order to travel to Ft. Lauderdale they required prior in-person authorization from the immigration authorities in Nassau,” the statement said.
Scott, R-Fla., early Monday demanded an end to the confusion, stating “Senator Rubio and I continue to urge President Trump to waive some visa requirements for those in the Bahamas that have family in the United States. But until that happens, there needs to be clarity on the current rules.”
Morgan said in his press briefing that in a disaster zone “there’s going to be some confusion” and then proved his point by contradicting immigration requirements by saying, “We’re not working and telling a cruise line you cannot allow anyone without documents. That’s just not being done. OK?”
A Customs spokeswoman told The New York Times the agency had not denied the ferry passengers entry, but instead had advised that passengers without visas disembark and coordinate with the American Embassy, because without such pre-clearance, it would have taken hours to process them in Florida.
A for-profit ferry
Jeffrey Devore, a Palm Beach Gardens immigration attorney, said requirements can be complex for Bahamians. There is an exception for Bahamians to come to the United States without a visa — be it a tourist, work or other kind.
But the exception requires them to go through a pre-clearance procedure at the airports in Nassau or Freeport where they must have a valid passport and a clearance letter from the Royal Bahamian Police Force.
Devore said he understood the ferry from Freeport was a for-profit venture and not a humanitarian rescue effort. “Then they learned they all were required to have visas,” he said. “If they bring them here without visas they get fined and they have to bring them back.”
Customs said it remains ready to process Bahamian refugees but stressed it depends on transportation companies to communicate with officials.
The agency pointed out that more than 1,000 Dorian survivors who arrived at the Port of Palm Beach aboard a cruise ship on Saturday were processed without incident.
Praise from Sen. Scott
The immigration pitfalls following Dorian are still developing but weren’t unforeseen. Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio last week asked Trump to waive visa requirements for Bahamians. That hasn’t happened.
“It’s important Customs and Border Protection and the Bahamian government work together to clarify the current rules regarding visas in the Bahamas,” Scott said in his morning statement.
“As hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport.”
Other politicians have expressed support to giving Bahamians temporary protective status, which allows foreign nationals whose home countries have been hurt by a war or natural disaster to live and work in America.
It’s under consideration, Morgan said in his news conference but “there hasn’t been any formal grant of TPS.”
Nonetheless, Scott praised the commissioner in his late Monday release, saying, “I’m glad Commissioner Morgan has agreed to allow Bahamians fleeing the destruction on the islands to temporarily come to the United States.”
While the Freeport ferry incident illustrated chaos, the rescue mission by Bahamas Paradise Cruise Line went off like clockwork.
Anita Mitchell, spokeswoman for Bahamas Paradise, said the hundreds of passengers aboard all had passports, visas and clean police records. Only a handful didn’t have families in South Florida.
Mitchell said sometimes the cruise line will lobby Customs on behalf of Bahamians whose passport had expired. But for many those documents washed away during Dorian.
Devore said those with missing passports will have to petition the islands’ government for replacement papers.
“The Bahamian government is going to be inundated with requests for documents because there was a lot of people who lost everything and their documents got swept out to sea.”
That is exactly what happened to bus driver Anthony Morley, 61.
He told Reuters his passport was lost in the hurricane’s storm surge and now feels stuck. “What I need is a house. I don’t have a bed, a refrigerator. I don’t even have a Bible,” he said.

Texto completo: Democracies used to collapse suddenly, with tanks rolling noisily toward the presidential palace. In the 21st century, however, the process is usually subtler.
Authoritarianism is on the march across much of the world, but its advance tends to be relatively quiet and gradual, so that it’s hard to point to a single moment and say, this is the day democracy ended. You just wake up one morning and realize that it’s gone.
In their 2018 book “How Democracies Die,” political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt documented how this process has played out in many countries, from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, to Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, to Viktor Orban’s Hungary. Bit by bit the guardrails of democracy were torn down, as institutions meant to serve the public became tools of the ruling party, then were weaponized to punish and intimidate that party’s opponents. On paper these countries are still democracies; in practice they have become one-party regimes.
And the events of the past week have demonstrated how this can happen right here in America.
At first Sharpiegate, Donald Trump’s inability to admit that he misstated a weather projection by claiming that Alabama was at risk from Hurricane Dorian, was kind of funny, even though it was also scary — it’s not reassuring when the president of the United States can’t face reality. But it stopped being any kind of joke on Friday, when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a statement falsely backing up Trump’s claim that it had warned about an Alabama threat.
Why is this frightening? Because it shows that even the leadership of NOAA, which should be the most technical and apolitical of agencies, is now so subservient to Trump that it’s willing not just to overrule its own experts but to lie, simply to avoid a bit of presidential embarrassment.
Think about it: If even weather forecasters are expected to be apologists for Dear Leader, the corruption of our institutions is truly complete.
Which brings me to a much more important case, the Justice Department’s decision to investigate automakers for the crime of trying to act responsibly.
The story so far: As part of its jihad against environmental regulation, the Trump administration has declared its intention to roll back Obama-era rules mandating a gradual rise in fuel efficiency.
You might think that the auto industry would welcome this invitation to keep on polluting. In fact, however, automakers have already based their business plans on the assumption that fuel efficiency standards will indeed rise.
They don’t like seeing their plans upended — in part, one suspects, because they understand that the reality of climate change will eventually force the reinstatement of those rules. So they have actually opposed Trump’s deregulation, which they warn would lead to “an extended period of litigation and instability.”
And several companies have gone beyond protesting. In a remarkable rebuke to the administration, they have reached an agreement with the state of California to comply with standards nearly as restrictive as the Obama rules even if the federal government is no longer requiring them.
Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is considering bringing an antitrust action against those companies, as if agreeing on environmental standards were a crime comparable to, say, price-fixing.
This would be disturbing even if it came from an administration that had previously showed some interest in actual antitrust policy. Coming from people who heretofore haven’t indicated any concerns about monopoly power, it’s clearly an attempt at weaponizing antitrust actions, turning them into a tool of intimidation.
And it’s also clear evidence that the Justice Department has been thoroughly corrupted. In less than three years it has been transformed from an agency that tries to enforce the law to an organization dedicated to punishing Trump’s opponents.
Who’s next? In at least two cases, Trump appears to have tried to use his power to punish Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, which the president considers (like this newspaper) to be an enemy. First he pushed for an increase in the post office’s package shipping rates, which would hurt Amazon’s delivery costs; then the Pentagon suddenly announced that it was re-examining the process for awarding a huge cloud-computing project that Amazon was widely expected to win.
In each case it’s hard to prove that these were efforts to weaponize government functions against domestic critics. But who are we kidding? Of course they were.
The point is that this is how the slide to autocracy happens. Modern de facto dictatorships don’t usually murder their opponents (although Trump has been fulsome in his praise for regimes that do, in fact, rely on brute force). What they do, instead, is use their control over the machinery of government to make life difficult for anyone considered disloyal, until effective opposition withers away.
And it’s happening here as we speak. If you aren’t worried about the future of American democracy, you aren’t paying attention.

Resumen: [...]The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses.

Texto completo: Political tribalism keeps getting worse. The demand for unthinking and uncompromising loyalty keeps getting louder. Individuals or institutions that try to maintain a sense of fairness and balance, that don’t want to choose sides in our Uncivil War, are branded as weak-kneed, fainthearted heretics. Two recent events highlight this dangerous development. First, Fox News was excoriated by President Donald Trump for daring to interview a Democratic Party official. And second, The New York Times was lambasted by liberal critics for a headline that was not, in their view, sufficiently critical of the president’s racist rants.
The parallels, of course, are imprecise. Trump has been eviscerating the press as a campaign strategy for years. But the similarities are still striking.
The president and his leftist critics share an instinct for intolerance: a deep disdain for anyone who strays from the party line, a demand for purity combined with a towering self-righteousness. You have to be on the Red Team or the Blue Team, a Loyalist or a Resister. Both sides fundamentally misunderstand the role of impartial and independent journalists. We belong to no tribe, root for no team. And if that sounds musty and old-fashioned, well, so does the Constitution, which not only protects a free press but defines it as essential to a healthy democracy.
Over on the left, the latest brouhaha was trigged by a Times headline over a story about a Trump speech that read, "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism." The words were technically accurate, but not nuanced or skeptical enough, and Times editors acknowledged the problem and changed it after the first edition. But that was not nearly enough to quell the bombastic blowback.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the headline served as "a reminder of how white supremacy is aided by — and often relies upon — the cowardice of mainstream institutions."
Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to President Obama, told Politico: "A vast swath of Democratic voters are pretty angry at the media. They see a racist liar in the White House, and a media too afraid to call him a racist or a liar."
At a meeting of New York Times staffers, one told editor Dean Baquet that the paper was "actively misleading" readers by being too soft on Trump. But Baquet, hit back. "Our readers and some of our staff cheer us when we take on Donald Trump, but they jeer at us when we take on Joe Biden," he told the staff meeting. "They sometimes want us to pretend that he was not elected president, but he was elected president. And our job is to figure out why, and how, and to hold the administration to account. If you’re independent, that’s what you do."
Baquet told CNN that there is a "generational divide" in the newsroom, and the meeting made clear there’s a racial one as well, with reporters of color among the loudest critics of their own bosses. But Baquet — the first African American editor of the Times — is determined to resist their pressure. "Our role is not to be the leader of the resistance," he insists.
We believe deeply in the traditions that Cavuto and Baquet are defending. No news organization is perfect, but at their best, they don’t work for the right or the left — for Trump or his rivals, for the Reds or the Blues. They are not Loyalists or Resisters.
They are simply journalists — fact-finders, truth-tellers — and more valuable than ever.

Texto completo: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire federal employees who publicly contradicted President Donald Trump's incorrect statements that Hurricane Dorian might strike Alabama, according to a report Monday in The New York Times. 
The threat led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to release an unsigned statement on Friday disavowing the National Weather Service's forecast that Alabama would not be impacted by the storm, the Times reported. 
The National Weather Service is a part of NOAA, an agency of scientists that is a division of the Commerce Department.
Now, the Commerce Department's inspector general is examining NOAA's Friday statement, and employees have been directed to preserve their files, the Times reported. Inspector general Peggy E. Gustafson, in a message seeking documents, wrote to NOAA staff members that the National Weather Service "must maintain standards of scientific integrity."
She added that the circumstances of the statement appear to "call into question the NWS's processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency."
A Commerce Department spokesman disputed the Times story, saying in a statement, "Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian." 
In response to the Times report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, "What started as an embarrassment from the president has snowballed into thuggish behavior from a Cabinet secretary to force scientists to bow down in obeisance to an anti-science president."
The weather drama kicked off more than a week ago when Dorian, which at times was a Category 5 storm, was threatening the Bahamas and Florida. Trump wrote then on Twitter that Alabama would be hit "harder than anticipated."
The National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, tweeted a few minutes later: "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama."
Then on Sept. 4, while speaking about the impending storm, Trump displayed a NOAA map that appeared to have been altered with a black Sharpie to include Alabama in the area potentially impacted by Dorian. 
Ultimately, the storm struck Bermuda before moving up the Southeast U.S. coast. Alabama was not hit. 
NOAA, in response to Ross' demands to fix the perception that the weather agency was contradicting Trump, then issued a statement last Friday calling the Birmingham weather service statement "inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time," the Times said.

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.
READ THEIR STORIES here
A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

Students abuzz from Pharrell Williams visit

Texto completo: There was a rare celebrity appearance at The College of Wooster last week, a private event that proved to be a big hit for the student body as they got to hear from a superstar entertainer, fashion designer and philanthropist during “A Conversation with Pharrell Williams,” held inside McGaw Chapel.
Williams offered several of his life philosophies during a question-and-answer session with Wooster president Sarah Bolton, which was followed by a dozen engaging questions from adoring students who were hanging on his every word. The conversation hit on a variety of subjects, from business interests to creative process to culture issues, and yes, even advice on selfies and Williams’ skincare routine.
While acknowledging “music and skateboarding are the lenses that (he’s) grown to see life through,” Williams emphasized the importance of education for young people to change not only their personal circumstances but society as a whole. “Teaching should be regarded as one of the most prestigious things you can do to honor your species … so no child’s education slips through the cracks,” he said.
Williams saved some of his strongest commentary for women’s empowerment issues. Discussing the upcoming “Now is Her Time” campaign, a partnership with adidas, he discussed the importance of collaborating with like-minded corporations that cater to women, and in closing advice to the students he implored, “take everything you learned from this incredible (college), take that, put it into action, stand next to women, and protect them at all costs.”
In another highlight, Williams compared Wooster’s “Independent Minds, Working Together” message to his work as a hip-hop producer. The 13-time Grammy Award winner believes “individuality is everything,” but by nudging artists to “go deeper,” similar to how Wooster faculty members mentor students, will encourage them “to reveal this other side of (their) personality” and “they end up shining brighter than they have in years,” possibly with the bonus of a new hit record.
The most entertaining part of the program came when Wooster students took to the microphone. Williams, sometimes taking dramatic and humorous pauses before responding, was asked about his philanthropy, thoughts on musical trends and the record industry, influences and why his songs start with a four-count beat.
The question that brought the best reaction came from A’Janay Nicholson, a sophomore from Baltimore, who after complimenting Williams’ inspiring work quickly pivoted to inquiring about his all-important skincare routine. The baby-faced 46-year old joked that it’s “coming to a market soon,” and after offering a few details, including “washing your face at least twice a day,” he motioned her to the stage for a handshake that she’ll cherish forever.
Williams’ impactful visit was courtesy of a friendship that he formed with Mark Dowley, a 1986 alum and current member of the College’s board of trustees.
Record International Enrollment Noted by NYT: Wooster’s remarkable international enrollment numbers, as you may have read about two weeks ago in this column, are starting to get national attention. In an Aug. 29 piece by The New York Times about the hurdles international students sometimes have to take on their path to a U.S. education, it was noted that “many colleges see the presence of international students as a strong selling point,” including Wooster, which “has had record (international) enrollment for the last four years.”
Academy of Religion Series Returns: After celebrating a golden anniversary last year, the College’s Fall Academy of Religion lecture series begins its 51st season this Wednesday. There will be a presentation on this year’s theme, “Indigenous/​Native American Religion and Spirituality: An Alternative Paradigm,” every Wednesday night from Sept. 11-Oct. 6, at Lean Lecture Room of Wishart Hall, starting with this week’s look at “Spirituality in Native American Ceremonies” by Larry Shirer.
This column will be published bi-weekly throughout the academic year. For more information on College news and events, visit news.wooster.edu or call (330) 263-2373.

Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top NOAA brass over Alabama forecast blowup

Texto completo: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if they did not crack down on forecasters who contradicted President Trump's forecast that Hurricane Dorian could affect Alabama.
Acting NOAA Director Neil Jacobs received instructions from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who phoned him from Greece, to take action on Friday. After Jacobs rejected the demand, Ross, whose department oversees NOAA, warned political staff would be fired if they did not negate the contradiction, according to the New York Times.
Later that day, NOAA released an unsigned statement rebuking the Birmingham office of the National Weather Service for a tweet it sent about Dorian that appeared to be in response to the president. "The Birmingham National Weather Service’s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time," an unnamed NOAA representative said. NOAA is the parent agency of NWS.
The report has already led to calls among Democrats for Ross to resign.
Tweet
The Commerce Department denied Ross threatened firings due to the controversy. "The New York Times story is false. Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian," a department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner.
The inspector general of the Commerce Department is now investigating NOAA's statement on Friday and is asking agency officials to preserve files.
Trump tweeted on Sept. 1 that Alabama and other southeastern states "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." Twenty minutes later, the National Weather Service station in Birmingham tweeted "Alabama will NOT see any impacts" from Dorian because it was projected by that time to remain too far east.
Earlier forecasts considered Alabama to be in its projected path, but a National Hurricane Center graphic shows the odds of low-end tropical storm-force winds associated with Dorian striking Alabama dropping significantly by Sunday to roughly 5%.
Outrage in the forecasting world skyrocketed last week as Trump repeatedly lashed out at the negative media coverage he received for his outdated forecast. The backlash intensified on Wednesday when Trump presented in the Oval Office a National Hurricane Center map of Dorian's projected path from Aug. 29 and people noticed that added to the graphic was a black semicircle next to the forecast cone that reached over the Florida panhandle and over a part of Alabama.
After NOAA issued an internal memo instructing staff not to contradict Trump about his Dorian forecast, NWS Director Louis Uccellini praised the station in Birmingham. "They were correct in clarifying that the threat was very low," he said at a conference in Huntsville, Alabama, on Monday. Birmingham office staffers were asked to stand up, and they received a standing ovation from hundreds of their forecasting colleagues.
With concerns rising about the president's influence over NOAA, an email to staff on Sunday announced the agency's chief scientist is investigating possible policy and ethics violations. In his message, Craig McLean said NOAA's news release was "political" and a “danger to public health and safety."

New York Times writer’s advice to Democrats: Lie about what you believe to defeat Trump

Texto completo: Here's a hot new tip for Democrats wanting to win the presidency next year: Lie about what you believe!
That piece of advice comes from liberal New York Times columnist David Leonhardt, who on Sunday warned Democrats that they have lately been professing policy views that “alienate most American voters.”
It turns out that eliminating private health insurance and opening up the southern border to all of the world’s poor aren’t home runs with the electorate. But these are precise examples of what the 2020 Democratic field has been pushing.
In each of the Democratic debates and in media interviews, the leading candidates have said they support decriminalizing illegal immigration and replacing all private insurance with one government-run plan.
Observing that public opinion on those proposals isn’t rocking through the stratosphere, Leonhardt wrote that Democrats need to stop talking about what they truly believe and do the opposite: “The best strategy for Democrats,” he said, “is a populist one that speaks to voters of all races.”
That sounds nice, but it would require that Democrats shut up about reparations, abandon their immigration fetish, and discontinue their climate change fearmongering.
There’s absolutely no chance any of them will do that. Democrats may routinely lie about the chaos at the border and about the cost of their healthcare plans but they’re being completely honest when they say they want open borders. They’re telling the truth when they call for government-run healthcare.
Those may not be winning positions in the general election but at least they’re honest ones.

Texto completo: Golfing and tweeting
during Dorian
Hurricane Dorian could have been a truly transformative moment for President Trump.
But instead of making constant appearances with federal emergency management officials or with the brave rescue teams on their way into the storm to help civilians or appearing on TV to reassure the millions of Americans in Dorian's path, he chose to play golf and "get hourly updates on the storm." He also made erroneous warnings that Hurricane Dorian was threatening Alabama.
I guess his warning to all of us who've been anticipating Dorian's wrath was a simple "fore" for those people in the fairway. So much for transformation. He is what he is. Too bad for us.

Defining fake news
Fake news can be either deliberate distortion, outright lying or omission.
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said the stock market would never recover if Donald Trump became president and ABC's Brian Ross stated the economy would suffer a downward spiral.
News that benefits or puts President Trump in a good light is deliberately omitted by the media: Employment for blacks and Hispanics is at record levels. Also, we didn't hear much about Trump righting the wrongs at the Veterans Administration by firing 500 poor-performing employees and protecting whistleblowers.
Where are the articles explaining that the defeat of ISIS and the move of the embassy to Jerusalem will make the Middle East a safer place and reassure all that American can be trusted to keep its word? How about NATO countries paying up their share?
What have we seen or heard of the excellent Trump nominations for pending South Florida judiciary openings?
Howard D. Zipper, Boca Raton
Guns, the NRA
and politicians
How much more gun violence will Republican elected officials turn their heads away from before they are willing to do the right thing?
Mental health is a poor excuse for covering up the money issues that the National Rifle Association does not want to give up. Money for innocent lives lost? A sad commentary, especially for those family members from as early as the horrific killings of young children in Newtown, Connecticut, all the way up to the second in a month Texas shootings in Midland and Odessa.
Shame on them to use the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, as the leading reason for halting the sale of assault weapons or universal background checks or just about anything to stop the carnage.
Stand up and be heard or be gone as you would be fired from any other job you were not doing. We, the citizens, are your employers. So be prepared to be voted out of office. That is what our democracy is all about.
Linda Gefen, Boca Raton
Listen to voters,
not the NRA on guns
A message to members of Congress: It's time to side with your constituents and not the NRA. How many deaths from gun violence, including mass shootings, need to occur before you pass sensible gun conrol legislation?
We are watching and we will vote you out of office if you don't listen.

Texto completo: Do you want affordable housing? If you're young and can't quite afford a house, you'll probably say, "Heck yes!"
But if you already own your dream home, you'll more likely say, "OK, just not near me."
These opposing attitudes are among the top national problems troubling our housing market.
Lower-income, first-time buyers clamor for the construction of affordable homes. But most existing homeowners want their homes to rise in value. They lobby their communities against construction, becoming NIMBY (Not in My Backyard) neighbors.
City councils usually cave to NIMBY demands, blocking development, particularly at the lower-cost end – jacking up home prices. Homeowners love it. Would-be, low-end buyers seethe. So do property owners seeking to sell to real estate developers.
Politicians' main desire is re-election. Their voter and campaign funder base? Homeowners. So they mostly side with NIMBYs, which makes it tough for teachers, police officers, nurses and other service workers to buy in the communities they serve. In California, things are so bad that state legislators tried limiting local councils' avenues to block construction. Approvals have finally started trickling in. But so have opponents' lawsuits.
The frustrating truth: Affordable housing and appreciating home values are in natural opposition. So don't wait for politicians to deliver the impossible. Whether you own or are hunting, weigh these steps now.
Aiming to buy?
Calculate what you can afford. Start by determining a monthly payment that easily fits your budget. Mortgage lenders will reverse-calculate this into a targeted home price range. Don't stretch like so many did in 2005, speculating they'd sell at a profit in a few years. Housing isn't a short-term play. Besides, while I anticipate stocks and the economy doing well for the next few years, when they eventually tank, home prices will almost surely follow.
Location is key
Ignore today's trendy neighborhoods. Instead, envision neighborhoods owners will increasingly covet in decades ahead. Prefer up-and-coming neighborhoods to posh, established ones. Choose those with natural or legal barriers to development. That restricted supply will help your home's value.
If you already own in an ultra-posh neighborhood, consider selling to rebuy in an up-and-coming region millennials will crave when they're middle-aged and paunchy. Also, refinance, especially if your rate is adjustable. Current 30-year rates average around 3.55% – which is near record lows. Figure how much you can save by locking in these low rates. Then shop for the best mortgage deal.
Ignore outdated thinking
Ignore the many conventional, wise-sounding but wrong voices of yesteryear still arguing you should send in extra payments to pay down your mortgage faster. If your house's long-term appreciation rate won't be faster than today's ultra-low and income tax-subsidized rates, you shouldn't be buying it or owning it in the first place. If you should generate extra cash, plug it into liquid savings, like stocks and bonds.
Lack of liquidity ultimately causes more financial loss and mortgage default dilemmas than carrying a mortgage slightly longer.

Texto completo: It was April 1980, and I was among the crowd serenaded by Bob Marley and the Wailers when Britain's Union flag was lowered to be replaced by a new banner. A whiff of tear gas floated over a wall at the Rufaro soccer stadium in Harare, the capital of the nascent state of Zimbabwe.
Prince Charles was on hand to formally give up control of his country's last African colony. A slender, bespectacled man who would become one of Africa's most notorious despots was about to secure a prize he had long coveted.
At midnight, Zimbabwe -- the former Rhodesia -- became Africa's newest independent state, and Robert Mugabe, the clear winner of internationally supervised elections just weeks earlier, was its first prime minister.
It was a crowning moment. A seven-year war had ended in victory for the nationalist guerrillas, and Mr. Mugabe was about to start on a trajectory that led from democratic roots to an inexorable gathering of power unto himself.
And until his ouster in 2017 and his death, announced on Friday, the tantalizing riddle of the Mugabe regime was the question of what had turned a hero of Africa's liberation -- and self-proclaimed champion of universal suffrage -- into a despot.
[Robert Mugabe, a liberation hero, became a strongman who once proclaimed "Zimbabwe is mine."]
As a young Reuters correspondent, I covered some of the final years of the war from neighboring Zambia and from Zimbabwe itself. Later I was a frequent visitor to Zimbabwe on behalf of The New York Times.
This was the pre-internet era. During a cease-fire that preceded the festivities in Rufaro stadium, I had sent my reports from remote bushlands by carrier pigeon. At the independence ceremony, I telephoned confirmation of the flag-raising by hand-crank telephone to a Reuters bureau, where the news was passed on by a telex machine.
From today's vantage, it could be argued the war that brought Mr. Mugabe to power in Zimbabwe was the product of an equally bygone era, framed variously by the struggle against colonialism, the rivalries of the Cold War and the unbending obduracy of white minority rulers.
In the late 1970s, the rickety passenger airplanes that landed in Salisbury, as Harare was then known, did so in a steep and gut-wrenching spiral to avoid antiaircraft missiles. The gallows humorists of the day, mimicking flight attendants, told travelers to turn back their watches to the 1950s.
That decade had been a golden age for white settlers drawn from the deprivations of postwar Britain to the sunlit uplands of a distant colonial outpost. For whites, even in war, Rhodesia was caught in a time warp of country clubs and drinks at sunset on shaded terraces scented by bougainvillea and jacaranda.
By contrast, the black majority endured segregation in urban townships and in rural reserves, denied access to the most fertile land and often serving whites in menial roles as housekeepers, gardeners, laborers and farmhands.
Those two bitterly divided worlds spawned a conflict from 1972 to 1979 marked by brutal tactics on both sides, with the fighting spilling into the neighboring states that harbored the nationalist guerrillas.
Mr. Mugabe, who sought to overturn the majority's racially defined status as third-class citizens in the country of their birth, drew inspiration from Mao's doctrine of liberation through the barrel of the gun. The prevailing political orthodoxy he embraced favored one-party states, not democracy. Once secured, power was rarely given up voluntarily.
[ As Zimbabweans learned of the death of their former leader , who held the country in his grip for decades, the reaction was muted.]
With the announcement of Mr. Mugabe's death at the age of 95, it struck me that he, too, had been caught in an era -- the liberation era -- that has been overtaken by newer times. He was unable to shake off the recourse to violent ways, a path embraced by many of his contemporaries, as the legitimate counter to violent oppression. Maybe he, too, was trapped in a time warp of his own making.
That is probably too charitable an interpretation of the increasing ferocity of Mr. Mugabe's intolerance of dissent as he tightened his grip on the reins of power in independent Zimbabwe, promoting himself from prime minister to executive president, sidelining political rivals and unleashing military force on civilians.
Yet for all of the trappings of power he had, it was sometimes tempting to think that he was not at ease -- and always suspicious of those around him -- for good reason.
It was no coincidence that he was replaced by one of his closest aides, Emmerson Mnangagwa.
At the start of his rule, there were signals of a possibly different path. While Mr. Mugabe had reason enough for bitterness toward the white authorities, who had imprisoned and reviled him, he offered reconciliation with the minority and a new start for the majority in his first broadcast to the nation as prime minister.
In the 1980s, he devoted much energy to an expansion of secondary education that made Zimbabweans some of the best-schooled in southern Africa.
In the early 1980s, in Harare, a resident might have been forgiven for thinking the peace settlement ultimately reached was one of Africa's greatest ever diplomatic transformations.
But there was always a duality to him. I first met Mr. Mugabe in the mid-1970s as I traveled between guerrilla headquarters in Zambia and Mozambique and on to peace conferences in Geneva, Malta and London, where he came under immense pressure from his African supporters to agree to the negotiated settlement.
In private moments, unnoticed by him, I had seen him rail against his aides as he sought to cement his authority among the increasingly powerful commanders of the guerrillas who fought white rule in his name. (One such commander, Josiah Tongogara, died in a car crash in Mozambique in late December 1979, provoking never-resolved suspicions of foul play.)
But in that same era, former guerrilla forces fought murderous pitched battles with government troops, clashes that offered a prelude to the massacre of civilians by Mr. Mugabe's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in 1982.
A decade after independence, the black majority's hunger for land drove a mass takeover of white-owned farms, encouraged by Mr. Mugabe.
Mr. Mugabe's rule offered conflicting narratives of violence and a fragile inclusiveness, a powerful impulse to dictatorship barely cloaked by lip service to democracy.
In the end, muscle always won out over moderation. Even at the best of times, Mr. Mugabe was a reluctant peacemaker, as his enemies -- real or imagined -- discovered to their cost.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A conservative’s response to LNP Opinion’s approach

Texto completo: LNP offers space for their readers to comment on subjects of the day or those dear to their hearts. It publishes letters from Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives and nonpolitical advocates for a variety of causes.
Opinion Editor Suzanne Cassidy, in her Aug. 25 op-ed (“How an op-ed placed on the back burner turned red-hot”) explained the process that ensures a variety of ideas are presented. I asked her if I could respond as a conservative voice. She agreed.
I dithered about voting for President Donald Trump but couldn’t possibly vote for Hillary Clinton with what I heard about her private email server; her handling of the attacks on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya; and especially her story that she landed as first lady in Bosnia amid sniper fire when videos showed her being greeted on the tarmac by a child who offered her a poem. That last was the killer for me because it was such an unnecessary and provable lie.
Now that Trump has been in office and doing great things for the country, I wish he’d be more careful with those tweets. I also wish the Democrats in Congress would try to work with the president and start living in reality. (One example: Congressional representatives calling for abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE is enforcing the laws Congress made and could change if its members so desired.)
OK, that’s my angle, so how do I, as a conservative, take issue with Cassidy?
In her op-ed, she explained that a certain conservative op-ed underwent editorial review and was found to have issues. I know what she means because she and other LNP editors have found problems in my letters to the editor. For example: I referred to an organization by its initials; it was changed to its full name (thank you). A more recent edit took out a paragraph that listed information LNP did not include in a news article. A couple of times the phrase, “in my opinion,” was added. Once, some time ago, an editor deleted a direct quote from former President Barack Obama but left in similar quotes from Trump and former President George W. Bush. I’ve been left wondering: Are conservative letters run through a liberal viewpoint?
Perhaps I could sympathize with sanitizing my letters if the same were done to the liberal letters. Except it does not seem to be the case. I’ve seen a letter saying every word out of Trump’s mouth is a lie — a physical impossibility. We see accusations and what I consider misconceptions touted as truth. The double standard that’s so obvious in the media is clear.
Cassidy also mentioned the columnists. Yes, we know many conservatives sometimes complain of President Trump’s words or tweets, usually while approving his official actions. But why does LNP include George Will as a conservative? He so hates Donald Trump he quit the Republican Party. LNP even published one of his 2018 columns titled, “Save the country, vote Democrat.”
The nationally recognized Democratic columnists we read in LNP don’t have many negative things to say about their party or their politicians. They shred Trump and call him every name in the book, including racist — which he definitely is not.
The columns we see are those LNP Opinion chooses. The New York Times’ Maureen Dowd, for instance, no longer appears in the paper. She told the truth about Hillary Clinton, even before the controversy over Clinton’s home-brew email system hit the fan. She hurls her best at any Republican but still tells the truth about Democrats. (The gist of one of Dowd’s columns in July: Disagreeing with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Squad” doesn’t make you a racist.)
As newspapers did in the time of Abraham Lincoln and even in Lancaster before its three newspapers became one, LNP Opinion should declare which side it is on. I can’t help sometimes not so silently disagreeing with LNP Opinion’s policies and wishing for a more balanced approach. But, hey, I have the same problems with some friends and family. I just wish full information from both sides was more readily available.

Texto completo: Two-thirds of all full-time employees in the United States are currently experiencing job burnout, according to a recent Gallup study. While we aren’t great at taking advantage of earned time off — a whopping 768 million vacation days go to waste every year — a survey by the American Psychological Association last year found that even a two-week getaway is merely a stopgap as work-related stress returns before our tans have faded.
Yet a growing number of people are finding new ways to cultivate stability and avoid or overcome burnout. Three years ago, after nearly a decade at design agencies, Ilyssa Kyu, 30, quit her job to catch her breath and spend more time with her newborn daughter.
“I took a leap of faith and did my own sabbatical,” said Kyu, who went on to not only bond with her daughter but also explore the trails and tribulations of national parks over five months. The results? A book, “Campfire Stories: Tales from America’s National Parks,” and the creation of a crowdfunded startup, Amble. The company’s monthlong retreats pair creative professionals with budget-strapped park conservancies that support National Park Service projects, such as wildlife protection and trail rehabilitation.
For $1,400, which includes lodging, program benefits and some meals, these “Amble Creatives” devote 18 hours per week working on small yet transformative projects, be it redesigning a website or increasing audience engagement. The nonprofits return the favor with guided national park hikes, exclusive conservancy engagements and an America the Beautiful annual park pass.
Architect and industrial designer Beth Van Why attended the inaugural Yosemite National Park retreat in the fall of 2018, and considers the four-week experience to have been life-changing.
“I reframed my approach to having work-life balance because I was able to take the time to pause and shift,” said Van Why, who worked with the Yosemite Conservancy, which has provided more than $100 million in grants to Yosemite National Park.
While at Amble, she focused on the conservancy’s Art and Nature Center Programs, making changes that included developing a more family-oriented visitor experience and expanding the programs to other locations within the park.
“I gave myself permission to question, explore, listen to myself and just be,” said Van Why, who is now thriving in her new role as a project manager working on museum and nonprofit projects. “The combination of using my design skills to help a nonprofit with that of living in a national park was really exciting.”
Anyone who has ever taken a walk in the woods knows the rejuvenating effects of the great outdoors. Amble believes that re-envisioning nature as an optimal work venue is one key element of its long-term success — and that of its participants.
“The experience of nature shifts individuals toward a state of relaxation, while also broadening the visual attentional scope,” said Dr. Shelley Carson, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of the book, “Your Creative Brain.”
“Science suggests that whatever people are doing, they will do it better after a healthful nature break,” she said.
Following sold-out retreats in Yosemite and the Sierra Foothills, Amble will host its third program from Oct. 7 to Nov. 10 in Glacier National Park, in partnership with the Glacier National Park Conservancy and Parks Project. Ten to 12 people are invited to join each program, and family-friendly accommodations have ranged from a 340-acre ranch in Mariposa, California, to a contemporary house on the Flathead River in Hungry Horse, Montana.
The participants range widely from web developers to marketing experts and craft makers; the latest Glacier National Park retreat accepted an artifact photographer from a science museum in San Francisco, as well as a Second City comedian-turned-social media strategist.
The program has so far attracted people from various career and life stages, Kyu said.
“People in a transition point who need to be inspired; people feeling burnt out, looking to recharge, get a new perspective and return a better employee; and the self-employed person looking to take advantage of flexibility and give back.”
Kyu sees participants like Van Why choosing Amble over other types of sabbaticals, such as artist residencies, Habitat for Humanity or work abroad programs, for its unique set of offerings. Chief among them: leading confidence-building projects independently, forming lasting connections with different creatives and enjoying backyard adventures in America’s wildest landscapes.
“There’s the perspective that giant cliffs, immense stars and never-ending expanses of land lends you,” Kyu said. “It forces you to put your work, daily struggles and grievances into perspective — maybe even move past them.”

Texto completo: It was sunnier 25 years ago than it was today.
"Folks, from the flight deck we should be on the ground in 'bout 10 more minutes. Sunny skies, little hazy," the first officer of USAir Flight 427 told the 127 passengers over the intercom. "Temperature's, ah -- 75 degrees, wind's out of the west around 10 mph."
Within minutes, the Boeing 737 would plummet to the ground near Hopewell as it prepared to land at Pittsburgh International Airport.
The National Transportation Safety Board would later find -- after the longest investigation into the board's history -- a rudder malfunction caused the crash that killed all 132 on board. The report, released March 24, 1999, detailed the investigation and included a transcript of air and ground communications as well as a transcript of the cockpit voice recorder.
The flight from Chicago O'Hare was set to land in Pittsburgh before going on to West Palm Beach. Most on board were Pittsburgh-bound.

Brian Stashak, vice president of terminal operations for the Allegheny County Airport Authority, was a gate agent for USAir at the time. He told Blue Sky, a news outlet run by Pittsburgh International and the airport authority, that he knew disaster was possible but never expected it.
"I never thought it would be something like that -- something just dropping out of the sky like that on a day as beautiful as today," he told Blue Sky.

The New York Times, in the days after the crash, profiled as many of the 132 victims as possible.
"Timothy McCoy, 27, had been repairing a machine that had broken down in Rockford, Ill. Lisa M. Ferm, 34, a regional director for Interstate Hotels, was returning home with two colleagues," wrote Tamar Lewin in the Sept. 10, 1994, edition of the paper. "David Mirilovich, 38, had gone to an engineering seminar. Randall Dellefield, 37, was at a conference with others from the Federal Department of Energy. Larry Grondin, 41, was on his way back from a machine tool show. And Daniel A. Clark, 61, had been to his company's home office near Chicago."
Erik Kelemen, then an airport firefighter, told Blue Sky the crew rushed to the scene while listening to the air traffic control radio.
"(As) we were listening to it on the crash phone, you could tell something was wrong because the air traffic controller on the line almost sounded like he was breaking up -- as if he was in tears or confused or just couldn't believe what he was telling us," he told the outlet.
The 20th anniversary of the crash in 2014 was the last formal memorial event for families and friends of victims.
"It has served its purpose," Dennis Connolly said at the time. Connolly, whose twin brother, Robert, died in the crash, served as a spokesman for the group that formed after the crash, the Flight 427 Air Disaster Support League.
The group helped push the passage of the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act two years after the crash, and it became a model for the National Air Disaster Alliance and Foundation.
"Things are different now," Connolly told the Trib in 2014. "People left behind are treated more humanely." </small>

Decades of dramatic CEO income growth

Texto completo: A recent Economic Policy Institute Study titled "CEO Compensation Has Grown 940 percent since 1978" was a Labor Day lament for American workers whose wages during the same period have only increased a meager 12 percent.
EPI's analysis found that this exorbitant, unconscionable earnings differential is the major income inequality contributor, and has persisted through equally indifferent Democrat and Republican administrations.
In its analysis, EPI emphasizes that CEOs earn more not because of demand skills, extraordinary productivity or other tangibles, but rather because of their absolute power to set and increase their pay scales. As a result of soaring CEO incomes, and more generally, higher executive compensation, the top 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent income brackets have exploded, while workers in the lower 90 percent of the earnings' bracket have been left in the cold for more than four decades.
EPI also noted that the economy wouldn't suffer if CEOs were paid less or taxed more, or if profits were distributed more fairly among all employees.
CEOs have unquestionably taken full advantage of their power to enrich themselves, and suppress lower-echelon employee wages. But another variable that contributes to 40 years of flat wages for hourly workers is the executive suite's addiction to cheap, foreign labor.
With what has been an unbroken inflow of illegal immigrant and legal guest workers, between 750,000 and 1 million annually, corporations have no incentive to increase domestic workers' salaries — and they haven't.
Unwittingly, a New York Times story provided an excellent example of how the immigration variable depresses the domestic salary scale. In "Is Immigration at its Limit? Not according to Employers," so many immigrants have come to the South Florida area that not enough labor is available to fill all the restaurant, nursing home and retail store jobs.
The story was a typical immigration cheerleading piece that offered the well-worn and misleading talking points. From Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Congressional Budget Office director and now the immigration advocacy group American Action Forum's leader: "Without immigration, we shrink as a nation." Holtz-Eakin added that two ingredients drive GDP growth — the size of the workforce and how efficiently those workers produce goods and services.
Columbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard has a better understanding of GDP. Last year. Hubbard said that the goal isn't GDP, but rather to deliver mass prosperity that makes people feel like they're all part of the same system instead of being left behind. Hubbard calls his theory the economics of dignity, something that the EPI study confirmed that the U.S. has moved far away from.
Hubbard and others would also be skeptical of how more immigration into South Florida could contribute to mass prosperity. By 2030, the state's population is projected to increase from today's 21 million to 26 million — with that unchecked growth comes more traffic, more sprawl, more school overcrowding, higher housing costs and a lower quality of life.
That immigration grows the economy is the age-old, half-truth argument. Sure, more people and more workers create a bigger economy. But immigration does not help the per capita income. Immigration's benefits accrue to the immigrants and to their employers, and not the general public. The traditional solution to filling job openings is to offer higher wages, not import more cheap labor. With more than 6.1 million people unemployed, that pool should be tapped first.
For Congress, as it has been for too many legislative sessions, creating a fairer immigration system that protects instead of harms American workers isn't on the agenda.

Trump and Biden have the same message

Texto completo: During a recent speech in New Hampshire, President Trump unveiled a new campaign line: "Whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me."
Citing the strong economy, Trump told voters that if he loses, "your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes," so "you have no choice!"
To underscore the point, when he finished speaking the music that came on was the Rolling Stones singing, "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well, you might find, you get what you need."
Not far away, in Nashua, the Biden campaign rolled out the very same message about its candidate. "I know that not all of you are committed to my husband, and I respect that," Jill Biden told Democratic primary voters. "Your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is. But you've got to look at who's going to win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, 'Okay, I personally like so and so better,' but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump."
To put it another way: "Whether you love Joe or hate him, you have got to vote for him."
Trump and Biden are both running on the same message, but with one crucial difference: Trump is directing his at independent swing voters; Biden is directing that message at his base.
The New York Times reports that, despite his commanding lead in the polls, Biden faces a problem of low enthusiasm. While Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., "have followings rooted in zealous support for their ideas," Biden's support is rooted in a belief that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump.
Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University's Polling Institute, told the paper that while spending time recently in Iowa "I did not meet one Biden voter who was in any way, shape or form excited about voting for Biden. They feel that they have to vote for Joe Biden as the centrist candidate, to keep somebody from the left who they feel is unelectable from getting the nomination."
The danger of running on electability is that all it takes is one catastrophic gaffe or debate stumble for Biden's support to collapse. And even if Biden manages to secure the Democratic nomination, running a campaign built exclusively on ousting the sitting president, rather than enthusiasm for your own ideas, is not a winning strategy. Just ask President Mitt Romney.
Trump, by contrast, has his base wrapped up and energized. The president consistently enjoys nearly 90% support among Republicans (in contrast with Barack Obama, who had just 75% support among Democrats at this stage in 2011, according to Gallup). For Trump, the risk of this strategy is not with his base, but with the swing voters who put him over the top in 2016.
According to Axios, in 2016 "20% of Trump's voters told exit pollsters they didn't like him." These reluctant Trump voters put Trump in the White House and are critical to his keeping it in 2020. Like many Americans, they are exhausted by the chaos of the Trump presidency. Biden is targeting his message directly at these voters, echoing George W. Bush's 2000 campaign pledge to restore "honor and dignity" to the Oval Office in the wake of the tumultuous Clinton presidency.
Yet, despite their exhaustion with Trump, many of these voters approve of his economic performance in office. Despite recent market turbulence, the U.S. economy remains strong. On Trump's watch, unemployment has reached a five-decade low, and our biggest economic problem is that we have 1.6 million more job openings than we have unemployed workers to fill them. And a decade after the Great Recession, wages are finally rising, with those at the bottom of the economic ladder benefiting the most.
The problem is that Trump has made virtually no effort to win over these reluctant Trump voters again, much less expand his base by appealing to Americans who did not vote for him but are benefiting from his policies. He is betting that presidents seeking reelection in a full-employment economy don't tend to lose.
The danger is that, if the economy takes a nose dive, his argument for reelection with these voters does as well.
Biden and Trump are giving voters an ultimatum rather than inspiration. They both may find that running on your unlikability is a risky strategy.

Texto completo: The head of the MIT Media Lab resigned Saturday following fresh allegations that he had deliberately masked the full extent of his ties to convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein, leaving the university and its acclaimed research center in turmoil, and the scientists who work there stunned and anxious about a place that has been dubbed the “future factory."
Joi Ito, who led the Media Lab for eight years and is credited with invigorating the center with more money, new ideas, and a diverse and ambitious crew of scientists, said he would step down immediately.
“After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as Director of the Media Lab and as a Professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately," Ito wrote in an e-mail Saturday afternoon to MIT administrators.
Ito also resigned from two other prominent posts.
The New York Times Co. announced that he resigned from its governing board, where he had held a seat since 2012. And he resigned as a visiting professor from Harvard University, where he taught a class on ethics and technology.
For weeks, Ito had been dogged by criticism over the money he had accepted from Epstein for the Media Lab and his own personal ventures, along with visits he made to Epstein's homes. But an explosive report in The New Yorker, published online Friday, suggested that Ito and other employees of the Media Lab tried to obscure Epstein's ties from MIT administrators and internal critics.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology president L. Rafael Reif said Saturday that the university will hire an outside legal firm to look into the allegations outlined in The New Yorker report by investigative reporter Ronan Farrow.
The report contained “deeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein," Reif said in a message to the MIT community, adding that they “demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation."
MIT had designated Epstein as “disqualified" to donate, but e-mails and other documents show Ito and Peter Cohen, the lab's former director of development and strategy, worked to keep Epstein's donations anonymous and to omit his name when reporting donations Epstein solicited from other philanthropists on the lab's behalf, according to The New Yorker.
Ito and other lab staff would list the financier by his initials on Ito's calendar and recorded his direct contributions as anonymous gifts, according to The New Yorker report.
Some staff members in Ito's office called Epstein “Voldemort" or “he who must not be named" in reference to the efforts to conceal his connections to the lab, the report said.
Ito has said that the Media Lab took $525,000 from Epstein, and media reports suggest that he personally took $1.2 million from the financier.
But these new allegations raise serious questions about whether that was really the extent of the donations, said Amir Pasic, the dean of Indiana University Lily Family School of Philanthropy.
“For one unit not to tell and hide the nature of the gift, is a big no-no," Pasic said. He added that the case opens up legal concerns about how the Media Lab handled large donations as well as the safeguards the university had in place to avoid employees purposefully obscuring gifts.
“It's hard to understand how these gifts were held secret from central administration. . . . It was almost laundered in some way," Pasic said. “It was unclear who was managing Ito. It seems he was given free rein, maybe too much."
Epstein was found dead in August in his jail cell at a federal detention facility in Manhattan, where he was being held on charges of sex trafficking of minors. He had been convicted as a sex offender in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution and had spent a year in jail. Despite that criminal history, Ito said he met Epstein in 2013 and wooed him as a donor for the lab and his personal ventures.
The Media Lab is home to more than 30 faculty and senior researchers and 275 other students and staff. Its $80 million budget is funded primarily by corporate giants including IBM, ExxonMobil, and Google, which gain broad access to the lab's research.
Ito, an Internet entrepreneur who was an early investor in Twitter, Flickr, and Kickstarter, had boosted its fund-raising and inspired deep loyalty within the lab. Now, some researchers are worried sponsors who joined because of Ito will leave or others may not want to be tainted by the association to Epstein.
“I'm very saddened," said Shuguang Zhang, a molecular architect, who joined the Media Lab earlier this year, drawn by Ito's energy and vision for the research center. “If he goes, it all goes down. Every place needs leadership."
Outside the Media Lab on Saturday, more than two dozen MIT students and others declined to comment. Alex, 20, a third-year student majoring in computer science who declined to give his last name, said that learning of Epstein's contributions made him consider for the first time the background of MIT donors.
“While mistakes were made in the past, I think it's really good that going forward we are taking steps to amend those mistakes by giving back the money and doing what we can . . . to make sure this doesn't happen again," he said, adding later that Ito's resignation was “a very good first step toward making amends."
Two former Media Lab directors said despite the recent controversy, the lab remains viable.
“It will survive," Walter Bender, a founding member and former director, who left in 2006, said in an e-mail. “But it will be (should be) a bit more introspective."
Nicholas Negroponte, who cofounded the Media Lab, has said he had encouraged Ito to take Epstein's money and, based on the information they had at the time, would do it again. But he said he was surprised by the revelations in The New Yorker article.
Negroponte said the lab can be rebuilt.
“It means that we have to work very hard to re-construct an institution appropriate to the present, but no less edgy than it was in the past," he said.
Ito had been fighting to retain his position since mid-August, when he first revealed he had taken money from Epstein for the Media Lab and for his own private venture funds. A prominent professor and a visiting scholar each announced soon after they would leave the lab in protest, while others came to his defense.
But by Saturday midmorning, many backers abandoned him, including several who had previously signed a petition in support of Ito.
“I believed what he said happened was everything that happened . . . but there was a lot more that he wasn't saying," said Bruce Schneier, a security technologist, who withdrew his support of Ito Saturday morning. “People trusted his ethics."

Texto completo: Entre las medidas en tema de políticas de inmigración que la administración del presidente, Donald Trump, evalúa actualmente, también está la posible reducción del número de refugiados que pueden entrar en EEUU.
La decisión del Gobierno se acerca, según reporta The New York Times y confirma The Associated Press. Ambos medios aseguran que funcionarios de la Casa Blanca tienen prevista una reunión de alto nivel sobre este tema para el martes de la semana que viene. El objetivo es discutir a qué cifra anual de refugiados se permitirá el ingreso, explican.
Como ya contó también Noticias Telemundo, el 1 de octubre empieza el nuevo año fiscal, una fecha clave para fijar el cupo de refugiados admisibles en los siguiente 12 meses. La administración Trump tiene intención de fijar el nuevo cupo antes de esa fecha, según AP.
Esta agencia asegura que no se ha llegado todavía a una decisión. Algunos funcionarios de la administración que han hablado bajo la condición de anonimato a esta agencia consideran que el número de refugiados se tendría que reducir debido a que EEUU está bajo presión por el aumento de solicitudes de asilo en la frontera sur y de otros países afectados por guerras o graves desastres naturales.
La jurisdicción prevé una diferencia entre las dos categorías: la primera, el estatus de refugiado, se refiere a personas consideradas bajo graves amenazas que se encuentran fuera de EEUU y que no pueden volver a su país de origen.
La segunda se asocia en cambio a migrantes que ya se encuentran en territorio nacional o en el intento de entrar en el país y que aseguran que estarían en peligro si vuelven a sus países de origen.
El Times afirma que el Gobierno baraja distintas opciones. Según las fuentes consultadas por este periódico, una prevé una limitación del número de refugiados que podría reducirlo a cero. Esta idea ha sido propuesta por un alto oficial de la administración. El primer medio que habló de esta posibilidad fue la revista Politico en julio.
Otra idea, confirmada también por AP, es establecer un máximo de 10,000 ó 15,000 ingresos anuales. El cupo establecido para este año fiscal fue de 30,000 refugiados, 15,000 menos que para 2018. El año fiscal anterior, cuando estaba en vigor la meta fijada bajo la administración de Barack Obama, el total de admisibles era de 110,000.
Ambas ideas harían que EEUU renunciara a su posición de país que más refugiados acoge en el mundo, destaca el rotativo neoyorquino.
La decisión tiene que tomarla el presidente Trump, según afirmó una fuente del Departamento de Estado. Pero la Casa Blanca todavía no ha hecho comentarios oficiales al respecto.
Un actual funcionario de la administración y varios exfuncionarios de la misma dijeron al Times que uno de los que más presionan para reducir ulteriormente el número de refugiados es Stephen Miller, el principal asesor de Trump en materia de inmigración.
Miembros de grupos de defensa del programa de refugiados, activo en EEUU desde 1980, indican que para la puesta en marcha de la medida será clave la posición de Mark T. Esper, secretario de Defensa desde el pasado julio.
Su antecesor, Jim Mattis, se opuso a grandes recortes del número de refugiados admisibles, alegando que estos afectarían los intereses militares de EEUU en el mundo. Un alto funcionario afirmó que la posición de Esper al respecto todavía se desconoce. Militares retirados y grupos de ayuda humanitaria están intentando convencerlo a tomar una postura parecida a la de Matis.
Organismos implicados en la ayuda humanitaria y reasentamiento de refugiados consultados por Noticias Telemundo consideraron que sería un desatino y una “catástrofe” continuar reduciendo el ingreso de refugiados, especialmente debido a la crisis global de 26 millones de refugiados que huyen de la violencia y persecución.
Hans Van de Weerd, vicepresidente del programa para refugiados del “Comité Internacional para Rescates” (IRC, por su sigla en inglés), dijo que si eventualmente la Administración baja a cero el número de refugiados, eso sería algo “catastrófico” para personas que dependen del reasentamiento para sobrevivir.
La decisión pondría en entredicho la credibilidad e influencia de EEUU en el mundo y sería otro “golpe bajo” de una Administración que ya implementó una veda a inmigrantes de países con mayoría musulmana, ha impuesto restricciones al proceso de asilo, ha separado familias en la frontera sur, y mantiene una política de detención de niños migrantes, agregó Van de Weerd.
A la fecha del 6 de septiembre, la cifra de refugiados aceptados a partir del pasado 1 de octubre fue de 28,501, según AP . El año fiscal pasado, se admitieron 22,491. Los latinoamericanos admitidos como refugiados en el año fiscal 2019 fueron poco más de 600, según el Centro de Procesamiento de Refugiados del Departamento de Estado.

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this avalanche of TV, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because a Ken Burns documentary is almost always an informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."

Questions of Benne chef Ashleigh Shanti

Texto completo: Ashleigh Shanti has been busy.
Since John Fleer's Benne on Eagle opened a year ago with its modern take on Appalachia-soaked soul food, both that food and the mission of the woman behind it have attracted a lot of attention.
And now, a torrent of press from big name publications: A gorgeous splash in the New York Times, "16 Black Chefs Changing Food in America," featuring Shanti in the lead was soon followed by a Time magazine piece naming Benne among its "Top 100 Places in the World" for 2019.
It was a one-two punch of publicity, and the restaurant hasn't hit a lull since.
"It's nice, because we've all worked really hard, so it's certainly great to get positive feedback," Shanti said. "It drives us to keep going and get better — but it also adds an element of pressure."
Expectations are high, she explained. "Getting attention in the New York Times is a pretty big deal, so I feel an immense amount of pressure to deliver what people are expecting."
But beyond that, there's the mission behind Benne: to help shed light on the rich African-American history of the surrounding neighborhood, and to honor the often uncredited black hands that helped form Southern food.
"For me, it's important to make sure we stay on the path with that goal and that mission, while feeding all these guests coming from wherever in the country," Shanti said. "The mission is still No. 1 in my mind."
What is your greatest inspiration in life? Remembering all the ancestors that did the work for me to be where I am today, and the level of equality I experience in my life. That drives me and inspires me to live life as fully as I can.
What is your greatest inspiration in food? My great grandmother Inez was a really amazing women — an award-winning canner, who frequently won blue ribbons at local markets and fairs for her incredible pickles and preserves. She had the right idea about true hospitality. I admired that about her. Even through her later years she threw a mean get-together. There was a level of warmth and comfort that just permeated from her. I was able to apply a lot of her practices and ideologies to my own career.
What is your biggest professional challenge? When I first got into this industry over a decade ago, there was no one that looked like me to look up to, not that I remember. And that was a huge challenge, always feeling different. As an industry, that's certainly changed. But being African American, being a women, being gay — that's so many boxes to check off.
Despite that, I can't say they've held me back, but I know that makes me different and separates me from my peers in this industry, which causes me to get into my own head. I'm my biggest critic and that presents a challenge.
More recently, the media attention that we've been getting has (impacted) both sides: more guests wanting to eat here, and more people wanting to work here. The challenge is to provide a space where people want to work, and to make sure our establishment is providing an inclusive space where people feel warm and welcome, and all the things a kitchen historically is not. We want to actually deliver what people expect when they apply for a position here.
What was your happiest moment? I can't pinpoint just one but on Saturday we had a record breaking night, so that was a happy moment for everyone.
The New York Times article made me super happy, to see all these amazing black chefs on the cover and also to call my mom and dad and tell them they could find my face in the New York Times. Making them proud and happy makes me happy.
What was your most challenging moment? Moving to Asheville, knowing very few people and signing onto this project (a hotel restaurant serving many purposes) weeks before it opened ... it seemed like a crazy decision, but it's one I believed in. I knew it was going to be a challenge.
What are you reading? Kevin Alexander's "Burn the Ice." It goes through the golden age of our industry and explores American dining at its height: the glorification of chefs and how a lot of these guys that we lifted up as culinary saviors have failed us and what that means for our future as an industry.
What are you eating? I'm drinking my saffron kombucha that I made at home. The last thing I ate was leftover tacos from Taqueria Munoz. That place is amazing, and I just had leftover chicharon tacos.
What are you most proud of? Definitely Benne on Eagle. It's been a highlight for me and, specifically, the cooks that have come in our doors. Eight months ago, some cooks who came in here needed to know how to hold a knife, and just to see everyone thrive and learn and have passion for the industry and food, wanting to visit the farms we source from, it's awesome to see passions awaken in a lot of the cooks who come through our doors. I feel like a proud mom.
What do you wish you could change about yourself? I'm super awkward, and I wish I could change that.
What do you wish you could change about others? I wish that people had more compassion for others. We would certainly get somewhere if we all could love each other more.
What keeps you in Asheville? Well, I feel like I just got here and still have a ton of exploring to do. One of the things most exciting things for me is experiencing flora and fauna that is completely new to me. As a hobby forager and general outdoorsy person, Asheville delivers. I also have a laundry list of restaurants and bars to visit.
This city has already been so kind to me, so leaving my mark just feels right. I want to continue to serve the community of Asheville and play a role in its diversification.
What does Asheville need to do better? Diversify. That's an easy answer for me.
What is your motto? Don't worry be happy. Obviously, that comes from that song. It's my motto but, by nature, I'm a huge worrier, and it's mostly an affirmation. Something to sing to myself in my head; a reminder to worry less and be happy.
Benne on Eagle is at 35 Eagle St.

Report: Healey balked at proposed Purdue settlement

Texto completo: Talks between state attorneys general and Purdue Pharma over a possible $12 billion settlement to resolve thousands of lawsuits brought against the opioid manufacturer have stalled, in part because Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is not on board, according to a national media report this week.
Reuters reported that OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy by the end of September unless it is able to reach a settlement with the states and municipalities suing it for its role in the nationwide opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. Word of the talks involving various state attorneys general, Purdue Pharma, and its owners, the Sackler family, was reported throughout the media last week.
NBC News reported that Purdue and the Sacklers had proposed a settlement of $10 billion to $12 billion to resolve the more than 2,000 suits against the company and family members. But Reuters reported Tuesday that “strong opposition from some attorneys general such as those in Massachusetts and New York emerged last week after confidential discussions on Purdue's settlement talks became public in media reports."
“Their main sticking point is how much Purdue's controlling Sackler family will pay," Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the negotiations.
Healey's office declined to address the Reuters report directly.
“Our fight against Purdue and the Sacklers is about exposing the facts, making them pay for the harm they caused, and shutting them down for good. The people who have been hurt by Purdue's misconduct have spoken, loud and clear, about how important it is to have real accountability," Healey said in a statement. “Our lawsuit exposed the roots of this crisis and we will continue to push for the full truth to be made public and to secure the justice these families deserve."
In June 2018, Healey filed the first state lawsuit against individual members of the Sackler family as well as Purdue Pharma, alleging that they “engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts" and profited from the drug epidemic they helped create.
Healey's complaint alleges that Purdue “created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit" by misleading doctors and patients to get more people on their drugs, at “higher and more dangerous doses" and for longer periods of time, as well as by deploying falsehoods to keep patients away from “safer alternatives."
A total of 671 Massachusetts residents who filled prescriptions for Purdue opioids since 2009 later died of an opioid overdose, according to the suit. According to Healey's office, Purdue sent sales representatives to Massachusetts doctors, offices, clinics, and hospitals more than 150,000 times since 2008.
Under the settlement framework described last week to NBC News and later to the New York Times, the Connecticut-based Purdue Pharma would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and restructure itself as a “public beneficiary trust." Future profits from the company would flow to the plaintiffs, namely state and local governments that have sued Purdue.
The Sackler family would cede control of the company and contribute $3 billion to the settlement fund over seven years and would add another $1.5 billion by selling another Sackler-owned business. Reuters reported that “several state attorneys general contend the Sacklers' proposed settlement contribution is too low" and that the attorneys general would rather that the Sacklers guarantee $4.5 billion.
Purdue Pharma said last week that it is “prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation" but is discussing a settlement because it “sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals" and “the people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now."
“Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome," the company said in a statement.
Last week, a judge in Oklahoma ruled that Johnson & Johnson had to pay the state $572 million. In the order, the judge declared that the company had run “false, misleading, and dangerous marketing campaigns" that “caused exponentially increasing rates of addiction, overdose deaths."
A federal judge in Cleveland is overseeing the more than 2,000 lawsuits filed against the Sacklers and Purdue. Reuters reported that the judge expected plaintiffs to update him on settlement progress this week and that he “wants 35 state attorneys general on board with a deal, a threshold that has not yet been reached."

Texto completo: Japan Medals for Tokyo’s 2020 Olympic Games will be made from 100% recycled materials. Over two years, 80,000 tons of phones and other electronic devices were donated to source all the necessary bronze, silver, and gold. Olympic hosts have a reputation for hasty construction projects and environmental degradation. But event organizers say the electronic recycling initiative and other sustainable practices, such as powering the Games with 100% renewable energy, are an attempt to change that legacy. (Tokyo 2020)
Mali The government has launched a multibillion-dollar plan to save the Niger River. The Niger is the main river of West Africa, beginning in the highlands of Guinea and ending in Nigeria, but it has become polluted from oil spills and plastic waste. The first step of the cleanup process will be clearing invasive species that inhibit natural water flow and cause sediments to build up. Mali is one of six countries that share the Niger River. According to Afrik 21, an environmental website, the deputy director general of the Niger River Basin Agency is calling on others to mobilize and do their part to “save this jewel.” (Afrik 21)
Germany The country is on track to use more renewable energy than coal and nuclear power in 2019. European market policies are leading to steadily increasing costs for carbon emissions for energy-intensive industries – some coal plants paused operations during the first six months from a lack of demand. So far this year, Germany has produced 47% of its energy from renewable sources and 43% from coal and nuclear sources; the country has set a goal to reach 65% renewable energy by 2030. (Deutsche Welle)
Syria Markets in ancient Aleppo are on the road to recovery after years of damage from a long-running civil war.  The Old City of Aleppo is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its bazaar was left in ruins. Certain sections of the markets are now being rebuilt. Shop owners welcome the renovations, but have voiced concerns about regaining customers, since the city’s inhabitants grew accustomed to shopping elsewhere and tourism stopped altogether. An architect interviewed by The Associated Press says that Western sanctions are delaying the work, but shop owners are hopeful that the renovations will lead to an economic revival. (The Associated Press)
United States A team of scientists in Arizona developed a way to overcome obstacles that have slowed coral reef restoration. Home to more than one-quarter of the ocean’s species, coral reefs are a dwindling and rare resource that cover only 1% of the ocean floor. Finding these precious reefs has been difficult for researchers because satellites have trouble capturing images below the reflective surface of the ocean. But this airborne mapping system can identify reefs from light-measuring sensors. Conservationists hope this innovation will accelerate their work in habitat restoration. Collaboration with The Nature Conservancy has already led to the Dominican Republic’s largest designated marine protected area. (The New York Times)

Texto completo: If you think our president is a “fool” who has “lost his mind” and is in the midst of “one the greatest political meltdowns of all time," I have some terrible news.
You’re more confused than Donald Trump has ever been.
And if you actually believe that Vice President Mike Pence has any interest in saving anything except his place on the ticket, stop trusting yourself with anything sharper than a giant foam finger.
The bankruptcy-prone birther is not deteriorating or crumbling. Nope. Sorry. He’s still the same sad, sadistic con man he has always been. And he’s on the verge of luring his opponents into making the mistakes that elected him, all over again.
The WWE’s tangerine terror only “won” the presidency because we underestimated him and overestimated the people and institutions that should have stopped him. The need to keep discounting him heading into the 2020 election is his greatest and possibly only asset, and the worst threat to our democracy we’ve faced.
This nightmare won't end on its own
Trump is actually getting better at the worst things that matter most, like avoiding accountability for high and low crimes, capturing the courts for the far right, and raising hundreds of millions of dollars to “carpet-bomb” Democrats. The institutions that were supposed to rein him in have done more to restrain his critics than him. Meanwhile, what reigns is the belief that this nightmare is bound to end on its own — what writer Sarah Kendzior calls “normalcy bias. ”
By now, we should know better.
Cognitive scientist George Lakoff warned in 2016, “Trump is a master salesman with a history of selling deals good for him but not so good for most others. ” But it may be “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams, the author of a book that claims Trump is a “master persuader,” who nailed Trump’s strategy: “When it comes to unfavorability, you don't need to outrun the bear. You only need to outrun your camping buddy. ”
Trump’s passion for kneecapping anything that might hold him accountable has even become clear to his favorite reporter. “A Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said weeks ago that the president, whose own approval ratings have stayed upside down, needs voters to feel negatively not just about his opponents but about longstanding institutions,” The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman tweeted.
Historic corruption is now normalized
There are definitely reasons for Democrats to be optimistic. Too optimistic.
They won the largest midterm vote margin in the history of the House of Representatives less than a year ago. Their potential 2020 nominees are beating Trump by a “historically large margin” in recent polls. And Rachel Bitecofer, the academic whose model most accurately predicted the 2018 wave election, sees a likely Electoral College win for the Democrats in 2020.
Bitecofer notes that her prediction would only require “massive restructuring” if there is a “significant upheaval,” which could include a well-funded third-party candidate and other “disruptions” like a terrorist attack or a recession. Unfortunately, the chances of a different sort of “significant upheaval” are trending toward 100% as the most obvious corruption in the history of the presidency is being normalized.
Time's wasting:Democratic debates don't match the moment. Time to get serious about beating Donald Trump.
Normally, when the president’s lawyer tweets “prosecutions will happen” in a reference to the president’s political opponents, it would be national news. Just as normally, you would expect some sort of congressional action when the president essentially asks foreign actors to hack his opponents or offers pardons to both achieve political goals and pay off his donors (as reported by The Washington Post based on unnamed administration officials). Instead, any hope that we’ll even see Trump's tax returns before the election seems to be vanishing.
Getting away with "it," whatever "it" is, is Trump’s greatest gift. His second greatest gift is a knack for smearing adversaries as the lowest slime in the cracks of the earth — in other words, Donald Trump.
The worst can happen, again
The current front-runner for the Democratic nomination, with his four decades in the limelight, might provide the perfect bull’s-eye for the president's patented psychological projection. What about former Vice President Joe Biden’s “gaffes,” questionable family business, possible foreign entanglements and history of race baiting? Trump will surely ask.
Regardless of who wins their nomination, Democrats are heading into what could be the messiest primary we’ve ever seen. And any of the front-runners would likely draw a third-party protest candidate into the race.
I'm writing from Michigan, where Trump won by fewer than 11,000 votes as Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party pulled in 172,136 votes and Jill Stein of the Green Party got 51,463. I can assure you that a third-party candidate doesn’t have to be well-funded to get Trump elected.
Flashback to 2016:Democrats failed to imagine the worst
Meanwhile, almost nothing has been done to secure our elections against the hacked emails, voter database intrusions and social media manipulation that we saw from Russia in 2016. And Trump continues to try to reward Russian President Vladimir Putin for that interference.
Verily I tell you, the worst can happen, again.
Ask yourself: What good did it do believing the polls in 2016, assuring yourself that this clown was bound to impale himself with a giant rake he stepped on? None.
We should all be doing what Georgia's Stacey Abrams is doing — everything we can to ensure every voter gets to the polls. For our greatest threat is underestimating the threat we face.

Cartoons' similarity creates headache for biotech CEO

Texto completo: Plenty of drug company executives have drawn fire for their high salaries or the cost of their medicines.
Praveen Tipirneni, CEO of Waltham-based Morphic Therapeutic, is taking flack for a cartoon he drew about the biotech industry that bears a striking resemblance to one published in The New Yorker magazine in 1986.
A Globe story last Thursday focused on Tipirneni's recent hobby of drawing whimsical cartoons that poke fun of the often abstruse world of biotechnology. One cartoon, published alongside the story, depicted an executive standing next to a scientist in front of a whiteboard. The executive, with arms crossed, scrutinized chemical formulas scrawled on the board.
“Close enough," he tells the scientist. “From here on in, it's who you know."
Howard Scott, a freelance writer in Pembroke and longtime subscriber to The New Yorker and the Globe, said he saw the cartoon at breakfast and thought it bore an uncanny resemblance to an old New Yorker cartoon. He has dozens displayed on the walls of his home office.
“I looked at the picture and I said, 'My God, I know that cartoon,' " Scott, 75, said. “I went to my office three steps away."
There, on his wall, was the one he had in mind. It was drawn by Eldon Dedini and depicted two men standing in almost the identical position in front a blackboard covered with mathematical equations.
“This is fine as far as it goes," one man, with his arms crossed, told the other. “From here on, it's who you know."
Scott included both cartoons in a letter to the Globe and wrote, “What is the line of cartoon plagiarism? Did Tipirneni cheat?"
Tipirneni said Wednesday that he didn't deliberately copy The New Yorker cartoon. But, he said, “I've been looking at cartoons all my life, and I think that one did stick in my mind. The resemblance is very striking there, so it must have."
Dedini drew 630 cartoons for The New Yorker and about 1,200 cartoons for Playboy before he died in 2006 at age 84, according to a New York Times obituary. The one he drew of the men in front of the blackboard is sold online and emblazoned on many products, from coffee mugs to tote bags.
A spokeswoman for The New Yorker declined to comment.
Tipirneni, who has a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a medical degree from McGill University in Montreal, and an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said he began drawing cartoons about a year ago.
He tweets them to people in the industry, features them in company presentations, and published several in a booklet for donors to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. But he said he doesn't make money off them and this was the first time anyone had raised questions about their provenance.
“I'm a little embarrassed about the whole thing," said Tipirneni, whose firm is working on treatments for fibrotic diseases and other disorders. “We're kind of trying to be seen as a serious science company."
Still, fans of his cartoons include some powerful people in biotech, such as Philip Ross, vice chairman of J.P. Morgan's health care investment banking division. Ross was quoted in the Globe article saying another cartoon Tipirneni drew was “almost like The New Yorker of biotech."
Now Tipirneni said he plans to be more careful when he draws cartoons.
“I guess it has to be a little less spontaneous," he said. “Clearly, I need to spend a little more time."

The 10 best new shows coming to TV this fall

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Mass. groups sue to stop policy change that would deport families of seriously ill children

Texto completo: Civil rights groups in Massachusetts on Thursday sued the Trump administration to stop a policy change that would deport families of seriously ill children receiving medical treatment in the United States.
The civil complaint was filed in US District Court in Boston by Lawyers for Civil Rights and the ACLU of Massachusetts on behalf of the Irish International Immigrant Center Inc., which helps families of immigrant children seeking medical care for severe illnesses.
The suit “challenges the Trump administration's abrupt termination of a longstanding government program [known as deferred action] that protects seriously ill people from deportation and death," the complaint said. “The administration's action is unconscionable. It is also illegal."
The plaintiffs want a judge to “declare the termination of USCIS's deferred-action program unlawful and enjoin its enforcement," according to the complaint. The filing names President Trump; Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services; Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, and other officials as defendants.
A US Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The White House had no immediate comment, and a Homeland Security spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The filing Thursday came after the policy change provoked fresh outrage last week, with health care providers fearing for their patients and elected officials demanding oversight.
It also came days after the Trump administration reversed course and announced a partial reprieve, saying it would consider some pending applications by severely ill immigrants hoping to remain in the country. In a statement Monday, USCIS said it was “non-military deferred action cases that were pending on August 7," when the change took effect.
“By way of background, 'deferred action' is a discretionary decision to temporarily postpone the removal from the United States of a person who is illegally present," the Monday statement said. “In the deferred action determinations at issue here, the Department of Homeland Security will make case-by-case, discretionary decisions based on the totality of the evidence and circumstances. Such cases will be decided based on the discretion of career USCIS employees, including but not limited to considerations similar to the Department of State's consideration of B-2 visas when such visas are requested for medical purposes."
Nationwide, about 1,000 people per year request deferred action for medical and other humanitarian reasons, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. The policy, for decades, has allowed some immigrants to remain in the United States legally while they receive medical care for complex conditions, according to immigration advocates.
Lawyers for some of the immigrants said last week that USCIS had begun informing families that it no longer considers requests for deferred action, and that the families must leave the country within 33 days. The change would apply to children and adults with cancer, cystic fibrosis, HIV, epilepsy, and other conditions.
“The Trump administration is hellbent on causing as much suffering as possible for immigrant families," said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, in a statement Thursday.
“This attack on children and their families is inhumane and unlawful. We will not stand for it."

Texto completo: Americans probably need more practice in sharing, writes Liz Soares.
Recently, my husband, Paul, and I settled down with our lunch plates at a Whole Foods Market. I’d noticed on a previous visit that the seating arrangement, which stretches along the front wall of the store, adjacent to the checkout lanes, had been changed for the better.
The square tables used to have four chairs per table, two on each side. Now all of the tables face a lengthy bench on one side, with two chairs per table on the opposite side.
I approved of this change. The bench made more seating available, and there seemed to be more tables than before. After piling up a plate in the takeaway area on the far side of the checkout lanes and then paying for my food, I wouldn’t want to have to stand up to eat it. That has never happened, but as an anxious person, it is always on my mind when I grab lunch at Whole Foods.
This sort of seating arrangement also fosters a sense of community. I remember when I first traveled abroad after college, I noticed that in Britain, it was perfectly acceptable to sit at a table that had empty seats, if no other tables were available. You’d ask before plopping yourself down, of course, but that was the extent of the protocol.
The new setup is good for people watching. So it was that I noticed when the woman at the next table got up, leaving a half-eaten pastry on the table and her pocketbook on the bench a few inches from me.
I thought perhaps she’d gone for utensils. Then a man came along and asked if there were seats available at this woman’s table. I indicated the pastry, which was on the side of the table farthest from me and said, “Just one person.”
He then swept the pastry over to the side next to me, and sat down. Soon he was joined by two other people. One was a woman I recognized. She had earlier offered to hold my plate as I struggled to put dressing on my salad. I’d thought that was a nice gesture.
She immediately noticed the pocketbook. “Has she been gone long?” she said to me. “Is she coming back?”
I shrugged. “She didn’t say.”
The absent woman soon returned. She did not express shock at seeing three strangers at her table. I might have uttered a small scream at the sight of my pastry being moved. But the woman, who was elderly, simply seemed perplexed.
She sat down, and the woman opposite her, who had held my plate for me earlier, started talking to her. The younger woman began with some pleasantries, but then she began asking the older woman where she had been. “You are very trusting to leave your purse on the seat,” she said.
As a keen observer of human nature, I was ready to burst. What the heck was going on here? Why was she grilling this woman? I have a pleasant demeanor and don’t come off as a common street criminal. The bag (and the pastry, come to think of it) had been safe, as it sat a few inches from me. If the older woman had not returned by the time we left, I would have brought it to customer service for safekeeping.
But as the conversation continued, I realized the younger woman was concerned. I thought then she might be a social worker, or a nurse, someone used to dealing with people who needed help. I don’t know if the older woman did need help, but the younger woman’s questions were clearly coming from a place of caring.
Americans are taught from an early age to value individualism. We fiercely defend our right to privacy. When the concept of socialism is bandied about, as it has been during this campaign season, there is much rending of garments and gnashing of teeth among certain segments of the population.
Yet, put people together at a lunch table and suddenly we see each other as neighbors. Come to think of it, that’s the kind of thing that’s being promoted in education today. Students who see a classmate eating alone are urged to invite them to join others at their table.
Another recent incident, however, demonstrated to me that Americans probably need more practice in sharing. I frequent another café with a communal seating arrangement. One day I watched as a woman set her things down at one table, then walked over to a man at another table. He was reading the Sunday New York Times, which was spread out in front of him.
“Is this the store’s copy?” she asked.
Much confusion ensued. It was the man’s copy, but she took a section of it anyway, promising to return it before he left.
I’m all for sharing, I really am. But don’t try to take my newspaper. That is where I draw the line.

BANKING
Wells Fargo Will Review Fees on Closed Accounts
Wells Fargo has begun an "extensive review" of the way it closes customers' accounts and the fees it charges some customers even after their accounts are supposedly closed, its chief executive, C. Allen Parker, said in a letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The letter was written on Friday, the same day that Ms. Warren asked regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, to look into the matter.
The practice, which was described in a New York Times article last month, charged customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars in overdraft fees in the weeks after Wells Fargo informed them that it was closing their accounts. The bank ignored complaints that at least two employees raised about the practice.
It is the latest in a series of scandals that have cost Wells Fargo $ 1.5 billion in penalties and have prompted the Federal Reserve to bar the company from growing until it can fix its culture.
Ms. Warren, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has been one of Wall Street's fiercest critics in the Senate. In a letter to Mr. Parker on Aug. 19, she said learning about the account closings and fees had led her to fear that "Wells Fargo is still fundamentally broken."
In his response, Mr. Parker said the bank was looking into the matter. "We are also working closely with our regulators in this area," he said. "Once we have completed our review and our discussions with our regulators, we would plan to provide you with an update."
Ms. Warren sent letters last week to the comptroller of the currency, Joseph M. Otting, and to the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, with questions about how the regulators were planning to respond to the Times article. Ms. Warren asked Mr. Clayton to investigate whether Wells Fargo had misled investors by reporting any fees collected on the closed accounts as revenue.
A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment. A spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would only confirm that it had received Ms. Warren's letter. EMILY FLITTER
MERGERS
Judge Approves CVS Purchase of Aetna
A federal judge reviewing a Justice Department decision to allow the American pharmacy chain and benefits manager CVS Health to merge with the health insurer Aetna said on Wednesday that the agreement was in fact legal under antitrust law.
Judge Richard Leon of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had been examining a government plan announced in October to allow the merger on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans. Both deals have closed.
The judge had initially balked at approving the merger conditions and insisted on hearing from critics of the deal. Though he approved the consent agreement, he criticized the common practice of companies' closing multibilliondollar deals while the court review, required by the Tunney Act, was still in progress.
Critics of the CVS-Aetna deal included the American Medical Association and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. REUTERS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee ordered homeland security officials on Wednesday to hand over records related to reported offers by President Trump to pardon aides willing to break the law to carry out his immigration policies.
With a subpoena addressed to the department's acting secretary, Kevin K. McAleenan, House Democrats indicated that they were continuing to expand the scope of their investigation into whether to impeach the president beyond the special counsel's core findings on Russian election interference and possible presidential obstruction of justice.
A president who knowingly directed government officials to break the law and dangled pardons to appease them would constitute an abuse of power, the Judiciary Committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, said on Wednesday. He promised hearings on the matter in the coming weeks, linking it to other potential abuses under investigation by Democrats.
"Such a troubling pattern of obstruction of justice would represent a continuation of the misconduct identified in the Mueller report," Mr. Nadler said in a statement. "The framers did not envision the use of the presidential pardon power to encourage criminal acts at the president's direction."
Democrats abhor many of Mr. Trump's hard-line immigration and border policies, arguing that they have caused the abuse of children and cruelly perverted long-held American values. But they view some of Mr. Trump's reported attempts to press reluctant homeland security officials to carry out his more drastic policies as a potentially clearer case of wrongdoing.
In one such episode this spring recounted by people briefed on the conversation, the president told Mr. McAleenan, then the chief border enforcement official, that he should close the southwestern border to migrants and that if he encountered any legal problems, Mr. Trump would just issue a pardon. Mr. McAleenan never took any such action.
Last week, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported that in an effort to speedily construct parts of his border barrier before the 2020 presidential election, Mr. Trump has told aides that they should seize private land and disregard environmental rules. When some raised concerns about the legality of such steps, the president told them he would pardon them if any laws were broken.
Mr. Trump had denied some of the reports, calling The Post's reporting "another totally Fake story" that was fabricated "only in order to demean and disparage." And a senior administration official insisted to The Times that Mr. Trump's comments were a joke.
The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately reply to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The House subpoena directed Mr. McAleenan to turn over by Sept. 17 any notes, memos or communications related to the discussions, including a meeting he had with the president in the spring and another, earlier meeting between Mr. Trump and the secretary of homeland security at the time, Kirstjen Nielsen, on a similar topic.
What the subpoena will yield is hard to predict, and it could end up in court. The White House has repeatedly challenged subpoenas coming from the House, arguing that lawmakers there either have no legitimate justification for their requests or that the president's executive authorities allow the executive branch to shield the material in question from Congress.
Either way, the demands come at a critical time for Congress and the president on possible impeachment proceedings. Mr. Nadler has said that he intends to crank up his committee's work tempo this fall and intends to decide by the end of the year whether to draft and vote on articles of impeachment.
In addition to the possible pardons and obstruction of justice, the committee is also preparing to use its fall session to newly scrutinize two additional topics in the context of impeachment. One is Mr. Trump's role in an illegal scheme during the 2016 campaign to buy the silence of two women claiming to have had affairs with him. The other is possible violations of the Constitution's foreign and domestic emoluments clauses by illegally profiting from his business while in office.

'Cowardice’: Mattis denies penning anonymous New York Times op-ed

Texto completo: Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis denied writing the anonymous New York Times opinion piece from one year ago that stated, "I am part of the resistance inside the Trump Administration."
The retired Marine general, famous for being blunt, said if he had written it, he would have put his name on it.
"I wouldn’t comment on it other than to say that I’ve never believed in cowardice. If I felt that strongly about something, I would have signed it," Mattis said on Morning Joe Wednesday morning.
"I would have been right up front about it. I think you would owe that degree of candor, but I think, too, we have to look at this as a test of everyone’s character in America," he continued. "Again, I don’t think we have a problem today that suddenly mushroomed into our observation and what we’re seeing here in the last six months, last two years, or last five years. I think this is a growing problem inside America."
Mattis said the country has "lost a fundamental friendliness" and "a sense of fairness" with each other.
"We really believe in some cases, that our people believe, 'I’m right about everything and that guy is wrong about everything,' and if we don’t wake up to the idea that the people we disagree with are fellow Americans, if we don’t understand that once in a while people we disagree with are actually right and if we don’t roll up our sleeves and start working together, then we’re going to have a problem in this experiment because this would set up so it would not work without cooperation, collaboration, and compromise," he said.

In the piece, the author wrote how, "I work for the president but like-minded colleagues and I have vowed to thwart parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations." The New York Times only identified the writer as "a senior official in the Trump administration."

Hill joins FEC in war on Drudge, online media

Texto completo: First, it was Democrats on the Federal Election Commission.
Now it’s congressional Democrats and Republicans who want to squelch the political voices on major online websites such as Facebook, Twitter, the New York Times, and eventually the Drudge Report.
According to an election law expert, Congress is set to take up consideration of a new law targeting small-time advertisers on the biggest trafficked websites.
Called the Honest Ads Act, it would force websites to police their site for fake influencers and identify the names and addresses of anybody who spend $500 or more on political ads. It was introduced by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is a co-sponsor. An identical bill was introduced in the House by two Democrats.
First Amendment advocates and conservatives said that is a threat to free speech. They also said it threatens small advertisers in the same way that Democratic presidential candidate Joaquin Castro did when he published the names of President Trump’s supporters.
"The first legislative response in Congress was the Honest Ads Act, principally targeting speech by law-abiding Americans and media companies in a clumsy effort to screen a tiny fraction of potential foreign propaganda. The act would require Americans who spend as little as $500 on ads, discussing any political topic, to publicly expose their identities, addresses and detailed information about their audiences,” former FEC Chairman Lee Goodman said in an opinion column.
He told Secrets that if passed, the legislation that expands the FEC’s playing field would expand beyond big websites with 50 million or more unique monthly visitors, but to the next tier including the Drudge Report, which has some 23.1 million unique visitors, according to the web counter Quantcast.
Goodman told Secrets, “Drudge is a meaningful metaphor for a political website that runs paid ads about political topics and gets tens of millions of unique visitors. The Honest Ads Act would make those websites legally responsible for collecting personal information about their advertisers and publishing that information. If they fail, they go to jail.”
As chairman, he worked to stifle efforts of Democratic commissioners to regulate conservative and online media, including Drudge. However, there is a new campaign that could impact Drudge and other online media.
For the Hill and under the headline "Honest' political ads: Watch out, Drudge, you're next," he wrote:
"The bill suffers from several inescapable flaws. It would apply only to paid ads — but, in 2016, most Russian propaganda was posted on free social media platforms. It would apply only to the largest media platforms — those with more than 50 million unique monthly visitors, which covers Twitter, Facebook and the New York Times but leaves thousands of other platforms viewed by hundreds of millions of Americans open to foreign propaganda. It would be only a matter of time before other highly visited advertising platforms are swept into the law. So, watch out, Drudge: Congress will come for you next."
Instead of larding on more rules for the FEC to enforce, Goodman said that Congress should amend another law, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, that gives the Justice Department power to filter out foreign media influencers.
“FARA should be amended to adapt it to foreign operatives targeting Americans via social media platforms. Its registration and disclaimer provisions could be extended to cover foreign speakers – not just their U.S. agents – whenever they purposefully utilize American telecommunications systems and equipment, including social media accounts, advertising platforms, computer servers and internet connections,” he wrote in the Hill.

Texto completo: The name, for many Democrats, evokes a golden-hued era in the White House, immortalized on Life magazine covers and in home movies of touch football on the lawn at Hyannis Port.
But the Kennedys, for all their luster as a brand, have had a remarkably checkered political history in recent years, as some of the children of John, Robert, and Edward Kennedy have stumbled in their bids for higher office or bowed out of politics altogether.
Their struggles in the family business suggest that voters — particularly those too young to have grown up with a bust of JFK on the mantel — no longer revere the dynasty, especially at a time when many have been rejecting elites and the political establishment.
Now, stepping into these crosscurrents comes the family's latest electoral hope, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, the 38-year-old grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and the only family member still serving in Washington.
He has signaled his interest in challenging Senator Edward J. Markey in the 2020 Democratic primary in Massachusetts, a race that would set up an intense intergenerational clash between two politicians with similarly liberal worldviews. Markey, 73, has served in Congress since 1976.
Kennedy, widely seen as a rising star who has emerged as a leading liberal voice against Trump-era policies, is eyeing higher office after a string of setbacks for the sprawling clan.
Last year, Christopher Kennedy, the eighth of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children, finished third in the Democratic primary for governor of Illinois.
His defeat came after Edward M. Kennedy Jr., the son of the late senator from Massachusetts, ended what many saw as a promising career in Connecticut politics by announcing that he would not run for governor in 2018 or seek reelection to the state Senate.
His brother, Patrick, a congressman from Rhode Island, retired from politics in 2011 to write a memoir on his struggles with mental health and addiction, and focus on mental health advocacy.
In 2009, Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, ran briefly for Senate in New York and was mocked for her awkward media appearances, including an interview with The New York Times in which she uttered the phrase “you know" more than 100 times.
And in 2002, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a daughter of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, failed in her bid to leap from lieutenant governor to governor of Maryland, losing to the first Republican to win that office in three decades.
“The electoral history has been mixed, and the reason is, it's been hard to extend the brand beyond New England," said Darrell M. West, a Brookings Institution scholar who has written about the Kennedys. “The bond is strong in New England but the region is also the most liberal politically, so people are more in tune with a Kennedy message of helping the downtrodden."
Kennedy has indicated he would run as a next-generation figure, championing “new ideas and a new approach," even though he is a scion of one of America's most prominent political dynasties.
“Congressman Kennedy's family is a huge part of his life, and he is incredibly proud of their record of public service," Emily Kaufman, the congressman's spokeswoman, said in a statement. “But in any race he runs, it's his name on the ballot. He runs on his own ideas, own record, and own vision for the future."
J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of “The Kennedy Heirs: John, Caroline, and the New Generation," said a Kennedy Senate campaign would fulfill the dashed hopes of his father, former representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, who was battered by political and personal scandals when he considered running for governor of Massachusetts in 1997.
Kennedy II was widely seen as the front-runner in that race until Sheila Rauch Kennedy, his former wife and Joseph P. Kennedy III's mother, wrote a book portraying him as a bully who tried to force her to grant him an annulment.
Soon after, Joseph P. Kennedy II's brother, Michael, was accused of having sex with a teenage baby sitter. A year later, Michael Kennedy died in a skiing accident, and Joseph Kennedy announced he would not run for reelection to Congress.
“That was very disappointing to a lot of people in the family — he had so much going for him, and they felt he had a chance at being the president," Taraborrelli said. “So I think it's interesting to see his son sort of going up the ladder of politics right now and being able to do so unafraid of the personal ramifications of that kind of decision, just considering what happened to his dad."
Taraborrelli said he suspects that Joseph Kennedy III's ambitions are important to a family that has long prized pitched competition and political success.
“They may say publicly that they don't care about this stuff anymore, but privately, they really do," he said. “They're still a family that wants to serve and loves politics, and it's in their DNA."
On the plus side for Kennedy, he would be running in a Democratic primary in the state where President John F. Kennedy was born, and that Edward M. Kennedy represented in the Senate for 47 years.
Philip W. Johnston, a former chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, said Democratic voters here still associate the family name with peace, human rights, and other causes championed by JFK and RFK.
“It isn't the name, it's what the name conjures up for many voters, which can be very powerful because of the history of the family," said Johnston, who serves on the boards of two Kennedy family charities with Joseph P. Kennedy III.
Laurence Leamer, an author of three books about the Kennedys, said this state might be the only one where a Kennedy running for statewide office could tap so readily into the memories that many Democrats have of the family's storied history.
“It's a button you could probably successfully push only in Massachusetts," Leamer said. “It didn't work in Illinois. It didn't work in Maryland. And to an extent, people under 40 don't even care about this stuff."

Think Your Aging Parents Are Being Inflexible? Maybe You Should Blame ‘mismatched Goals’

Texto completo: To what extent, the researchers asked middle-aged adults, do your parents ignore suggestions or advice that would make their lives easier or safer?
Ignore instructions from their doctors?
Insist on doing things their own way, even if that makes their own or others’ lives more difficult, inconvenient or unsafe?
That’s how several studies directed by Allison Heid, a gerontologist consulting at Penn State and Rowan University, measured adult children’s perceptions of stubbornness among their aging parents.
It proved a widespread complaint.
In an initial study of 189 adult children and their parents, Heid and her colleagues found that 77% of children (average age: 55) reported stubborn behavior by their parents, at least sometimes.
But two-thirds of the parents (average age: 80) described themselves as stubborn, too.
In a later study, the researchers asked 192 middle-aged children to keep a seven-day diary of parental interactions. Of those who had contact with their parents that week, 31% reported “insistent” behaviors and 17% reported “risky” behaviors; 11% said they encountered both.
“The stories are endless,” said Heid, whose interest in the subject was sparked by a grandmother determined to shovel snow, despite her children’s protests, into her 80s.
‘Screaming matches’
Lori Kayne, a geriatric social worker in Bridgewater, New Jersey, can tell such stories. Her late father, whose poor balance had caused multiple falls but no serious injuries, resisted her pleas to use his walker. “We had a lot of screaming matches,” she recalled - but she never prevailed.
Then last year, her father fell and fractured several vertebrae. “He was in terrible agony for months,” Kayne said - but at least he was finally relying on the walker. She figured that at 87, he’d grown more reasonable.
Nope. “As soon as he started to feel better, he refused the walker, even though he knew what could happen,” Kayne said, sighing.
Laura Perry has seen similar battles. Her father-in-law, 87, worried about skin cancer. When he needed a ride to a dermatologist’s office, Perry, who lives nearby in Glastonbury, Connecticut, obliged.
During the appointment, she recalled, her father-in-law indicated which skin lesion he wanted biopsied. The doctor replied that after examining all his patient’s lesions, he would decide which, if any, warranted testing.
The annoyed patient wouldn’t defer, so Perry drove him home, un-biopsied. The standoff recurred three months later. Her father-in-law still wants a biopsy. “I’m not taking you again,” Perry tells him.
Making it sound better
The more polite social science term for such skirmishes: mismatched goals. “If the goal is not shared - the older adult wants to walk to the grocery store himself and the child says, ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea’ - that’s when conflict can arise,” Heid explained.
Such clashes, and related reports of stubbornness, increase when the parent and child live together, she found. Perceived stubbornness also rises when a parent’s disability increases.
“When a child steps in, most commonly there’s a safety issue,” Heid said. “The parent may not share those feelings about their capabilities.”
These familiar, probably universal, safety-versus-autonomy debates have led some critics to object that adult children overemphasize the former, when what matters more to their parents is maintaining independence and pursuing what they find meaningful.
When parents feel thwarted, does resistance really constitute stubbornness? Perhaps their children, who in these studies were not serving as hands-on caregivers, were domineering or intrusive.
Stubbornness might actually be a positive trait, Heid suggested. It shows tenacity, persistence, a sense of control.
But stubbornness, it turns out, can also have hurtful consequences. In Heid’s largest study, involving nearly 400 middle-aged children, the most common response was avoidance: Children back off and let the contested issue go.
“But when they do, they report more depressive symptoms and less positive relationships,” Heid said. “They may be internalizing their distress.”
Arguing with one’s parents has similarly unhappy outcomes. What helps, the study shows, is reasoning. “It allows for a more open exchange of views and more discussion,” Heid said.
Reasoning with someone who seems impervious to it sounds, well, challenging. “It’s a really hard thing, this mismatch between what we need and what we want and what’s good for us,” said Marci Gleason, a social psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin.
Social scientists have learned that older adults who provide support have increased well-being and better health. Receiving help, on the other hand, is associated with negative mood.
After decades of helping their children, older people understandably balk at becoming dependent on them. “Even if intellectually they accept it, actually receiving help is difficult,” Gleason said. “It can signal that you’re not needed, and people want to feel needed.”
She suggests trying to equalize power in the relationship, allowing the parent to also provide support, even by just listening empathetically to a child’s account of her tough week. “It could be beneficial for the relationship to not have it all be one-sided,” Gleason said.
She’s also a fan of incremental progress, a negotiation that leads to a more reciprocal exchange.
As proof of concept, meet the Abrams family.
Carl Abrams, a 90-year-old retired Air Force colonel, lives in Williamstown, New Jersey, with his wife, Joan, 88. He cheerfully agrees that yes, he’s plenty stubborn. “He gets very angry and oppositional,” said his older daughter, Tamar Abrams, 63, who visits twice monthly from Falls Church, Virginia.
Driving them crazy
In 2016, the family was worried about his driving. Carl Abrams had knocked several side mirrors off his Buick, sometimes wandered out of his lane, once fell asleep at the wheel and sideswiped a truck. It was time to relinquish the keys, the family said.
After extended wrangling, Abrams agreed to a retest by the state motor vehicle agency, a gambit that backfired. “We were convinced he would fail, but he aced it,” said his daughter.
Months passed; his wife began refusing to ride with him. The family negotiated a series of escalating restrictions: First, Abrams agreed not to drive at night. Then, to drive only to familiar places. Finally, to stay within 5 miles of home.
“Sometimes he would blow up,” Tamar Abrams said. “But if you gave him some time and then returned to the discussion, he’d be OK.”
Now, Carl Abrams relies on a bright red, battery-powered scooter. “An excellent compromise,” he said. “If it wasn’t for the scooter, I’d go crazy in the house.”
Twice weekly, he cruises 2 miles to have lunch at Applebee’s, where the servers all know his name, and picks up a few groceries on his way home.
“If he didn’t have to cross a major intersection, it would be a lovely ritual,” Tamar Abrams said. Nobody (except Carl Abrams) feels good about his navigating across six lanes on his scooter, even at a traffic light.
But she understands. “You’re holding on for dear life to who you think you are,” she said. So, “we hold our breath and let him do it.”

Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib think America is always wrong

Texto completo: America is, and has been, the beacon of freedom in the modern world, yet, these two Congresswomen somehow have a tough time acknowledging it.
Recently, Israel barred Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering the country, citing their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, one which even the Democrat-controlled US Congress voted down in bi-partisan fashion by a margin of 398-17. A few days later, Israel granted a humanitarian exception to Ms. Tlaib and allowed entry so she could visit her grandmother. Tlaib declined the offer and instead held a press conference where she shed tears and falsely claimed that Israel barred her from visiting her grandmother. She promptly followed up her tear-filled claim with a fundraising letter.
Omar and Tlaib have constantly hidden behind their skin color, national origin, religion and gender while refusing to accept responsibility for their poor judgment, irresponsible remarks and questionable alliances. This time Omar and Tlaib attempted to hide behind their special status as members of Congress. They could have easily visited Israel with 41 of their Democrat colleagues led by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who took the trip earlier this month. Instead, they opted for a trip sponsored by Miftah, a pro-Palestinian group that supports suicide bombers and spreads false claims that Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover, according to New York Times columnist Bari Weiss. The Congresswomen's official agenda called it a "U.S. Congressional Delegation to Palestine." Ms. Tlaib has a world map in her office with a post-it "Palestine" that has an arrow pointing to Israel on the map.
Anti-American remarks and actions by Omar and Tlaib are innumerous. In 2017, Omar took a trip to Honduras sponsored by the pro-Communist, anti-American group Witness for Peace. She subscribes to the Marxist view of the Cold War, which makes America the villain.
Then there is Omar's reference to the attacks of 9/11 as "some people did something." Neither Omar or Tlaib have condemned the terrorist organization Hamas or those in the middle east who burn American flags and chant "Death to America." Just this month, Tlaib spoke to reporters where she said, "MY city of Beit Ur al-Fauqa is so excited." She tweeted about "the love for MY city" referring to a city in the middle east. I thought she was from Michigan...
One final point: In 2016, I was invited to meet with a delegation of Israeli parliamentary staffers. During the conversation, I started responding to one of their questions with, "America is the greatest country in the world..." when I realized that my audience may feel that their country, Israel, is just as great. I tried to be mindful to their sensitivities, so I continued with, "I recognize you may feel that Israel...." but I never had the chance to finish my sentence. "Sam, we love Israel but America is the greatest country in the world," said one of the members of the delegation. Somehow, America's greatness, acknowledged by many around the world, seems to have eluded Omar, Tlaib and their allies. The protestors in Hong Kong, all of whom are Chinese citizens, waved the American flag and sang our national anthem many times during their recent protest. America is, and has been, the beacon of freedom in the modern world, yet, these two Congresswomen somehow have a tough time acknowledging it. This great country took Omar, a Somali refugee from a Kenyan refugee camp, granted her citizenship, and sent her to the hallowed halls of Congress. All we ask for is a little gratitude. Apparently, that is too much to ask.

Why HBO series 'Our Boys' is causing controversy

Texto completo: "I've been kidnapped," a voice can be heard saying in Hebrew in the opening of a new HBO series about the lead-up to the 2014 Gaza War.
It's Gilad Shaer, a 16-year-old Israeli who, along with two other Israeli teens, was kidnapped by Palestinian terrorists as they were hitchhiking home in the West Bank. Somehow he has managed to call the police.
The emergency dispatcher tries to get more information, but Shaer is silent.
"Head down," a voice can be heard yelling repeatedly in Hebrew.
The opening and the series' name - "Our Boys" - suggests that it will focus on the kidnapping that rocked Israel five summers ago.
Shaer, along with Naftali Fraenkel, 16, and Eyal Yifrah, 19, were missing for more than two agonizing weeks, during which Israeli security forces conducted an aggressive and highly publicized search. Their bodies were found 2 1/2 weeks later and Israel blamed Hamas.
On July 8, following escalating tensions with the Gaza-based terrorist group, Israel launched a ground operation in Gaza known as Protective Edge.
But the series, which premiered on Aug. 12, does not spend much time on the kidnapping and its immediate aftermath.
Instead it uses the incident as the backdrop to the tragedy that followed: the revenge kidnapping and murder of a 16-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Abu Khdeir. Autopsy results suggested that he had been burned alive. In 2016, a Jewish-Israeli man, Yosef Ben-David, was convicted for the murder along with two minors.
The decision to focus on the murder of the Palestinian teen has drawn criticism in Israel, despite what the creative team said was a conscious choice.
"We were drawn to understanding the perpetrators of this murder more than we were interested in understanding the victimhood of our side," Hagai Levi, one of the filmmakers, told Drama Quarterly.
The series is "a story of pain turning into revenge," he added.
Some 120 Israeli families who lost members in terror attacks disagree. They wrote a letter to HBO criticizing the show's viewpoint, saying it equates two events that differ in significant ways.
"Khdeir's murder was met with shock and condemnation by the vast majority of the Israeli public," the parents wrote, according to Israel Hayom. "Dozens of Jews are murdered as a result of the ongoing incitement by the Palestinian Authority every year. The Arab street does not condemn the murder of Jews and even supports and encourages it."
The Palestinian Authority has a policy of paying stipends to the families of terrorists either in prison or killed in the attacks - a policy that Israel has dubbed "pay to slay." Its leader, Mahmoud Abbas, rarely speaks out against attacks against Israelis, though he did condemn the kidnapping of the teens.
"Our Boys" was created by two Jewish Israelis, Levi and Joseph Cedar, and one Arab-Israeli filmmaker, Tawfik Abu Wael. Cedar, a two-time Academy Award nominee for best foreign film, and Abu Wael directed the series.
The show gives viewers a look inside the lives of the main actors in Abu Khdeir's murder - from Mohammed's grieving family, to the Israel Security Agency members investigating the crime, to the Orthodox man behind the murder and the world he inhabits.
Interspersed with the scripted action are real clips from the summer - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking at the teens' funerals and news anchors discussing new developments.
A disclaimer says that "some of the events, characters and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes." Watching the series, it's hard to tell what is real.
"The idea was to create a unifying world where you don't reveal what is documentary and what isn't," Levi told Drama Quarterly.
One of the main characters, an Israeli investigator named Simon with a backstory of his own, is entirely made up. Others are based on real people, although which parts are embellished is often unclear to the viewers.
The series' strength lies in the insight it provides into people from all parts of Israeli society who are somehow involved with a wrenching incident.
"What they're setting out to do, and it will be interesting to see how it lands, is really going deep into characters that weren't really accessible for most of us as reporters," said Jodi Rudoren, who covered the events for The New York Times when she served as its Jerusalem bureau chief.
"Our Boys" also shows the disbelief from Israeli society that one of its own had committed a lynching.
"I know Israeli racism, but Jews don't do something like this," a policeman tells one of the chief investigators after Mohammed's body is discovered in the second episode.
Marcy Oster, JTA's Israel-based briefs editor, recalls that feeling of incredulity as she covered the events.
"When I wasn't reporting on the kidnapping of the three Jewish teens and the discovery of their bodies, I was trying to help my children work through their feelings about the incident," she said. "It became even more difficult when we learned that Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khdeir had been burned alive. We did not want to believe that Jews had committed such a horrific and indefensible act."
Rudoren said that singular spotlight on Abu Khdeir's murder and how it came to happen - while glossing over the murders of the three Israeli teens - is likely to differ from how many Jewish Israelis experienced the events.
"I was sitting in a place of covering both sides, Palestinian and Israeli, so I definitely experienced those two things as parallel events. Most Israelis definitely did not," said Rudoren, who is leaving The Times to become the editor in chief of the Forward. "For most Israelis, the month of searching for the yeshiva boys was a major, major event, and the idea that would be almost a prologue to this story would be surprising."
Challenging prevailing perspectives about that summer's tragic events is exactly what the creators sought to do. That also means challenging perceptions of Abu Khdeir's murderers, Cedar told Drama Quarterly.
"It's easy to say they were extremists, but they're not," he said. "They are just like us. So we tried to understand how this could happen - could it be us? Could it be our children?"

Texto completo: When Victoria Blamey interviewed in March for the job of executive chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, a Greenwich Village fixture for 35 years, she had never eaten there. She didn't even know the kind of food it served. So she came in for dinner. The difference from her cooking "was night and day," she said.
Where her style is boldly creative, these dishes -- like miso-marinated black cod, and goat-cheese ravioli -- were rich and reminiscent of a former era in fine dining, served on white dishes, on white tablecloths.
"I was more confused than anything," she said. "Our styles were so far. What I kept saying is, 'I think you guys missed a generation."'
To its many fans, Gotham is a New York institution -- best-known for its former chef, Alfred Portale, and the tuna tartare and towering chocolate cakes he popularized in the 1980s and '90s. (Mr. Portale left in May to prepare for the opening of his own restaurant, Portale, but remains a partner in Gotham.)

But to Ms. Blamey -- an alumna of Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria and Upland who won plaudits for her short stint as executive chef of the West Village speakeasy Chumley's in 2016 and 2017 -- the restaurant is in desperate need of an update. She took over the kitchen two months ago, and her new menu will appear on Wednesday.
Since Ms. Blamey, 39, left Chumley's, she has cooked at a few pop-ups, competed on "Iron Chef" and appeared in the Netflix documentary "The Heat: A Kitchen (R)evolution," which profiles several female chefs.
"She is passionate, she is driven, she is disciplined and she represents a contemporary approach," said Bret Csencitz, the managing partner of Gotham Bar and Grill. "We wanted a new voice."
Mr. Csencitz and the owners -- Jerry Kretchmer, Jeff Bliss, Rick Rathe and Robert Rathe -- went looking for a creative, ambitious chef, and told Ms. Blamey she had full license to update the menu. She has completely overhauled it. "I wouldn't be doing justice to myself if we kept anything on the menu," even the signature dishes, she said.
Her approach is more innovative and multicultural. There will be yellowtail crudo paired with a purée of smoked avocado, fish sauce, cilantro and milk, and Wagyu beef glazed with a veal jus blended with tomato water, coriander seed, glucose and lovage. There may also be some version of chupe, a thick stew from her native Chile.
The bar menu will be more casual, "with a lot of Chumley's," Ms. Blamey said, including a burger laced with bone marrow.
Then there are smaller adjustments, like cooking pasta to order instead of before service. As for the vertical plating style Mr. Portale made famous at the restaurant, "no one wants to see that right now," she said flatly.
Ms. Blamey is also replacing many of the white plates with colorful ceramics, and removing the tablecloths from the bar tables. The brown-hued crown moldings will be painted off-white, to lend an airier feel. (The fabric-covered hanging lamps will stay.)
"I want to see people being more loose," she said. "I want the bar to be buzzing with people who are my age, eating oysters or having a beautiful rillette."
Ms. Blamey's kitchen staff is a mixture of longtime Gotham employees and new hires whom she worked with at other restaurants. "A lot of people left" once she started, she said -- perhaps because of her gender, she speculated, or her desire to make major changes.
She is certain that the restaurant -- which Sam Sifton awarded three stars in 2011, the last time The New York Times reviewed it -- will draw fresh attention from restaurant critics. That's the only part of the job she finds slightly intimidating.
"But I can do this," she said. "You bring in younger, ambitious people, and this is what you get."

Forever 21's potential bankruptcy filing marks the overdue death of fast fashion

Texto completo: For Forever 21, the end was clearly nigh when it collaborated with Cheetos.
In June, the fast-fashion retailer, best known for selling teenagers $10 graphic tees emblazoned with kitschy phrases such as “will squat for tacos," joined with Cheetos to release a line of snack-themed shirts, socks, and even underwear.
But it’s not Cheetos’ fault that Forever 21 is preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing, as Bloomberg reported last week. It’s not the fault of USPS either, although that collaboration appears equally odd. Likely, Forever 21 is failing because it never evolved from mall staple to online powerhouse.
Consumers, though, shouldn’t lose much sleep over the struggles of the retail giant. Forever 21, like other fast-fashion stores, is bad for workers, the environment, and fashion itself.
In 2016, the Los Angeles Times found that Forever 21 clothes were being made by factory workers in Southern California who were paid as little as $4 an hour. Stores such as Forever 21 or H&M, whose business models rely on selling the latest trends at dirt-cheap prices, are infamous for relying on virtual slave labor just to maintain their ability to sell cheap leggings.
Charles Manning, style director at Cosmopolitan, wrote at the time:
“Brands like Forever 21 need cheap (even criminally cheap) labor to produce goods they can then turn around and sell at the insanely low prices consumers have come to expect. But it is impossible to ethically produce a dress for $18 without it severely impacting a company's bottom line, which, let's be real, is the only thing any company actually cares about.”
Forever 21 is so committed to thrift that it allegedly stole Ariana Grande’s image instead of paying her the price she set for a collaboration. The singer is now suing.
Fast-fashion brands aren’t good for the environment either. Tatiana Schlossberg, author of Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have, wrote in the New York Times that fast fashion may stick around much longer than we’d expect and not for a good reason:
“More than 60 percent of fabric fibers are now synthetics, derived from fossil fuels, so if and when our clothing ends up in a landfill (about 85 percent of textile waste in the United States goes to landfills or is incinerated), it will not decay.”
In a review of Dana Thomas’ Fashionopolis: The Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes, which came out this week, Schlossberg says the author rightly points out the drawbacks of fast fashion but misses one point.
“Another: Does the landfilling of non-synthetic clothing matter? Thomas doesn’t say, but in fact it does, because it contributes to global emission of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas,” she writes. Forever 21’s cheaply made clothes, which wear out easily and quickly become dated, seem ready-made for the landfill.
If the exploitation of workers and the damage to the environment isn’t bad enough, Forever 21 isn’t creating value in the fashion department either. Dawn Trevino, a 19-year-old, told the Los Angeles Times that she rarely shops at Forever 21 anymore because it’s too “cookie-cutter.”
“I want something unique, and I feel like that’s the new thing,” she said. Forever 21 isn't offering anything different, except for its collaborations with Cheetos and USPS, which aren't likely to scare off any competitors.
Lillian Fallon, a fashion writer who says she no longer shops at fast-fashion stores, recommends shopping at ethical fashion brands or thrifting, instead.
“At 15, I developed an interest in fashion and realized that the cookie cutter clothes offered at the mall weren't my style,” she wrote for Verily. “I wanted items that were unique. At 25, I still thrift for that reason but also because it's the best way to build an ethical wardrobe — something generally thought to be too expensive for the average shopper.”
Forever 21's failure may be a sign that consumers are becoming aware of the problems with fast fashion and turning toward retailers focused more on timelessness and sustainability. Some shoppers combine thrifting with online innovation, turning toward websites such as Poshmark and Depop, where users can buy and sell used clothes.
As Forever 21 works out its financial woes, perhaps shutting down some of its 800 stores, it should take notes from new players in the fashion industry. Shoppers may be turning away from fast fashion at last, and everyone, from the factory worker to the consumer, will be better off for it.

Seven strategies to put your diet on a plant-based path

Texto completo: A plant-based diet may have seemed extreme years ago, but today it’s all the rage — and for good reason. In many ways the planet and human health are in trouble, and a plant-centric diet is one way to address both issues.
More than 10,000 studies in peer-reviewed medical journals show that a diet based on whole plant foods leads to higher life expectancy and lower rates of cancer, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s and most other chronic ailments. “If you eat the standard American diet, you’re going to get the standard American diseases,” says Ocean Robbins, co-founder of the Food Revolution Network and author of 31-Day Food Revolution.
“However, a plant-based diet can add years to your life and life to your years. ” When you look more closely at heart disease, the No. 1 killer of American adults, the story becomes even more convincing. “The only diet proven not just to prevent but also reverse heart disease is a plant-based diet,” says Marco A. Borges, exercise physiologist, founder of 22 Days Nutrition and New York Times bestselling author whose latest book is The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World. Statistics show that roughly 600,000 Americans die from heart disease every year, but 80 percent of cardiovascular disease is preventable, especially with a shift to a plant-based diet, says Dr. Saray Stancic, a lifestyle medicine physician in Ramsey, N. J.
There’s also evidence that the current food system is unsustainable. “Worldwide, animal agriculture provides 18 percent of humanity’s food calories and 37 percent of protein, but uses 83 percent of farmland and one-third of the planet’s fresh water, and is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the world’s cars, planes, trucks, ships and trains combined,” Robbins says.
Yet, changing how you’ve always eaten isn’t easy. Where do you start? Experts share seven strategies:
1. Don’t think all or nothing. Just as Rome wasn’t built in a day, you don’t need to shift your diet overnight. “Every step you take toward more whole plant foods is a step toward greater health for you and the planet,” Robbins says. How closely you lean into plants is your choice, but know that in the “Blue Zones” — places around the world where people live the longest and healthiest — diets are focused on whole plant foods with almost no added sugar or processed foods and between zero and 10 percent of calories from animal products. In the United States, however, approximately 54 percent of calories come from processed foods and another 34 percent from animal products, Robbins says. No amount of processed food is healthy, and even if animal products are a small part of your diet, “the Blue Zones show that what’s best is a lot less than most are eating,” he adds.
2. Make plants the star of your plate. If you’re eating like most Americans, animal products comprise most of your plate. An easy fix? “Put plants at the center of your plate, and if you do have any animal products, make them the side dish,” Stancic says. As your taste buds adapt to this new way of eating, gradually push animal products off your plate completely so that you’re following the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine’s Power Plate formula, which divides a meal into four quadrants: whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.
3. Add whole plant foods to your environment. Your environment plays a key role in determining whether you’ll succeed at adopting a new habit, which is why it makes sense to set it up for success. The best strategy? “Bring more whole plant foods into your house and put them out where you can see them,” Borges says. How many times, after all, have you bought fruits or veggies, shoved them into the back of your fridge and later found them spoiled because you forgot about them? Instead, keep fruits and veggies at eye level in the fridge and place bowls of fruit on counters in view. At the same time, keep unhealthy processed foods out of sight as you gradually work on cutting them from your kitchen.
4. Be a planner. Nothing gets done in life without some planning, healthy eating included. Start by shopping from a list, as you’ll stand a better chance of avoiding unhealthy impulse purchases, Robbins says. Then think about your meals for the next week, or just the next day if that’s easier (“plan breakfast before you go to bed,” he adds, suggesting overnight oats or presoaked chia blueberry porridge), so that you don’t end up eating unhealthy food in a pinch.
5. Do batch cooking. When Borges’ mom switched to a 100 percent plant-based diet, he advised her to pick a day each week to cook foods like whole grains and beans in batches, even making salad dressing for the week. She could then store the foods in the fridge or the freezer and pull them out as needed. “Although it takes time to cook them, it’s a huge time-saver,” he says.
6. Adopt the Meatless Monday habit. This global campaign encourages people to take meat off their plate every Monday, and it’s a good entry point to eating more plants. “Research shows that we have our best intentions for healthy eating on Monday, and Meatless Monday is a great way to dip your toes in the water,” says Sharon Palmer, registered dietitian and author of Plant-Powered for Life. After seeing how easy it is, you may be encouraged to eat meatless on other days, too.
7. Find support. No matter what change you’re trying to make, going it alone can be challenging. That’s why Stancic asks her patients to bring family members when she speaks to them about adopting a whole food, plant-based diet. “You’re introducing a significant change into your life, and if you don’t have support, that change becomes more difficult,” she says. Even if your family isn’t on board, you can find support in friends, work colleagues and local meetup or Facebook groups. Of course, changing habits can be challenging, and for many, shifting to a plant-based diet is a work in progress. And that’s OK. As Borges says, “Aim for progression, not perfection. ”

Mattis book already discounted by 43%

Texto completo: Former Pentagon chief and Marine Corps general Jim Mattis’ upcoming book about the lessons he has learned during his lifetime of service has been suddenly discounted the day before its Tuesday release.
At BJ's Wholesale Club, a bulk discount household store, in Falls Church, Virginia, the hardback edition of his book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead, was already on sale Monday at $15.79 — a 43% discount on its full price of $28. On Amazon, pre-ordered copies were available at $18.77, a 32% cut.
The cut price could be attributable to nervousness about sales by the publisher, Random House Books, or in an effort to drive up sales and get the book onto the New York Times bestsellers list. The book could be difficult to sell because Mattis only mentions Trump once — when, in the first two pages, he recounts being picked as Pentagon chief. In an ear of highly-partisan political books achieving huge sales, Mattis cannot be identified as pro- or anti-Trump or even as having sympathies with Republicans over Democrats or vice versa.20190902_184551.jpgThe book, co-written by Bing West, who was a Marine officer in Vietnam and has written numerous books about the Corps, delves into more than 40 years in uniform. The book, which is 245 pages with another 50 of appendices. also touches on Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden’s time as Barack Obama's vice president.
Biden, 76, was appointed by Obama to oversee America’s withdrawal from Iraq. In the book, Mattis, 68, blasts Biden’s decisions for creating the vacuum that led to the rise of the Islamic State and critiques the drawdown of U.S. forces in the region at the time.
Mattis was head of Central Command, which oversees U.S. troops in the Middle East, in 2011 when forces were pulled out despite Mattis warning Biden about the folly of the move.20190902_184557.jpg
“He wanted our forces out of Iraq," Mattis writes. “Whatever path led there fastest, he favored. He exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly.” Obama, 58, eventually sent troops back to Iraq in 2014 when ISIS began to seize parts of the country and bordering Syria. Mattis had retired the year before after being fired without even a phone call to inform him he was being replaced.
Mattis returned to the public eye in 2017 when President Trump picked him to be secretary of defense. Mattis held the role until his resignation became official in January. He cited Trump’s decision to slash U.S. troop presence in Syria for his departure in a frank letter sent to the administration in December last year.
The general is best known by the nickname “Mad Dog,” which some Trump administration officials said was one of the reasons the president appointed him. But the self-styled warrior-scholar much prefers to be known by his Marine call sign of "Chaos."
Asked about the "Mad Dog" moniker in 2017, Mattis said: "It was a slow news day I think and somebody made it up. My call sign was Chaos. But I must confess how I got that name. It’s probably because, you know, the great Chinese classical warfare strategist, Sun Tzu. You copied him or something like that. I’d love to tell you it was for a dignified reason like that.”
In fact, however, when he was a colonel and regimental commander in Twentynine Palms in California where, according to Mattis, “there’s nothing to do but go blow up the desert," he noticed the word “Chaos” on the operations officer’s whiteboard.
“I said, ‘What’s this about?’ I’m curious, you know. We all are. He says ‘oh you don’t need to know that,’” which only further piqued his curiosity.
Mattis continued: "Finally, he kinda said, ‘Well it means the colonel has an outstanding solution,’ and it was very much tongue in cheek, ladies and gentlemen. They didn’t consider all my solutions quite as outstanding as I enthusiastically promoted them. There was never a ‘Mad Dog’ in there, other than some press person who needed a little bit of a fantasy life fulfilled I think.”

Texto completo: A commercial dive boat with 39 passengers and crew members aboard was engulfed in flames early Monday and sunk hours later near the Santa Cruz Island shoreline off the Ventura County coast. By late Monday, authorities confirmed that 25 people died in the ordeal, with several others still unaccounted for, the Associated Press reported.
FIve of the boat’s six crew members were rescued.
By midday Monday, authorities had confirmed that four victims were found dead near the 75-foot vessel Conception, which departed Saturday from Santa Barbara Harbor for a Labor Day holiday weekend excursion. Later in the day, crews discovered four more bodies on the ocean floor near the wreckage of the vessel, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said.
The AP reported that, by late Monday, the Coast Guard had confirmed that at least 25 people had died.
Torrance resident says ‘divine intervention’ kept him off deadly dive boat
What sparked the horrific fire, which was first reported to the Coast Guard via a frantic mayday call around 3:30 a.m., wasn’t immediately known.
“Our hearts go out to the families of the victims of this terrible tragedy,” Brown said at a somber news conference. “We understand the tremendous burden they are under right now as they wait to determine exactly what happened. We will be working diligently to get them as much information as possible as soon as possible.”
Authorities were continuing to search into the evening for more of the 33 passengers unaccounted for after flames tore through boat. The Conception also carried six crew members, five of whom were rescued after fleeing the burning craft, officials said.
“We will continue to search but we should be prepared for the worst outcome,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said.
Firefighters responded to the blaze shortly before 3:30 a.m., about 90 miles from Los Angeles. Coast Guard Sector Los Angeles-Long Beach overheard a mayday call about 15 minutes earlier of a commercial vessel with 39 people aboard.
By the time crews arrived shortly after the mayday call, the boat was fully engulfed in flames with little anyone could do to save it, said Mark Hartwig, Santa Barbara County’s fire chief.
Crews from the Coast Guard, Santa Barbara Fire Department, Ventura County Fire Department and Vessel Assist responded. The fire crews were fighting the blaze when the vessel sank 20 yards off shore in 64 feet of water, officials said.
Authorities said that initial four recovered bodies had injuries consistent with drowning, according to The Associated Press.
Five of the boat’s crew members were rescued by a nearby boat.
“The crew was actually already awake and on the bridge and they jumped off,” Rochester told reporters at a news conference at the Channel Islands Harbor.
They were evacuated on to a good Samaritan’s boat, Grape Escape, the Coast Guard said. Two of the crew members had minor injuries, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Barney.
“When we looked out, the other boat was totally engulfed in flames, from stem to stern,” Grape Escape owner Bob Hansen told The New York Times. “I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat. There were these explosions every few beats. You can’t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.”
As the morning turned to afternoon, family members of the missing passengers trickled in to the Coast Guard station in Oxnard in search of answers.
Sheriff Brown told reporters that the passengers would have be identified through DNA, depending on the condition of their remains.
A woman who came to the harbor early Monday said, “My son was on that boat.” She was led away by a Ventura County firefighter.
At around 8:30 a.m. the vessel had a portion of the bow sticking out of the water, authorities said.
Rochester said that the missing passengers were sleeping below deck at the time of the fire. She said authorities were working with the owners of the boat which had been in “full compliance” prior to its trip departure.
Rochester said rescuers would continue searching through the night.
“This isn’t a day that we wanted to wake up to,” she said at the afternoon news conference.
Several photos on social media posted by the fire agencies showed the Santa Barbara Harbor-based vessel completely overtaken by flames.
According to the Worldwide Diving Adventures website, the boat was on its last day of a three-day diving excursion that started in Santa Barbara Harbor. The Labor Day weekend trip, which started Aug. 31, gave passengers the opportunity to see marine life and explore San Miguel Island, according to the website.
The Conception had departed at 4 a.m. Saturday with plans to return Monday.
The boat was launched in 1981 and had a 46-person capacity, according to its profile on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara company that owns the ship. It had rafts and life jackets for 110 passengers and a fixed CO2 engine room for fire suppression.
Divers sleep in a single room of bunk beds, according to a diagram of the Conception posted on the website.
Thomas Kruger, director of scuba operations at Dive N’ Surf in Redondo Beach, said the boat and the operator had a good reputation.
Dive N’ Surf has booked charters on the Conception and other dive boats operated by Truth Aquatics, but not for at least a year mainly because of the distance, he said.
“This has been way out of left field,” Kruger said in an interview Monday. “The boat has been a phenomenally good boat that was meticulously kept. There was nothing anytime they were diving that would have indicated an event like this.”
Dive boats of that size are typically inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard about once per year, Kruger said. Operators also generally perform regular checks of fire extinguishers and other safety devices whenever the boat goes out, he said.
“Having a boat of that caliber there is a lot that goes into maintaining those boats and the systems on them,” Kruger said.
The event had a major effect on the close-knit diving community. Calls have been coming in inquiring whether anyone local was on board, Kruger said. As of Monday afternoon, the identities of the victims had not been released and Kruger did not know if any local divers were on board.
“We are sending out our prayers and our hopes that we get some better news by the end of the day,” he said.
Dale Sheckler, a Torrance man who is an experienced diver, had planned on spending Labor Day weekend aboard the Conception, but a hip surgery sidelined those plans.
“I feel frightened and relieved at the same time,” Sheckler said. “I’m also sick about the lives that were lost. I’m upset about it. My heart goes out to them.”
Sheckler said he’s been on the Conception several times before, but hasn’t been on the vessel in well over a year.
“I think considering the fact that the crew lost one of their members, I think that people need to understand that the crew was probably unable to assist those in distress,” he said.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.
Members of the diving community also expressed their grief on social media. Many shared their thoughts on the Truth Aquatics Facebook page, some recounting their own diving experiences.
Others showed photos of the vessel’s sleeping area, pondering if passengers could have escaped.
Most, like Kruger, offered their condolences and prayers.
Sprinkled into the comments were those who questioned why members of the crew may have been the only ones to survive. That sentiment was addressed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who Monday afternoon called for an “immediate and robust” investigation.
“It’s inconceivable that with all the safety regulations we have in place today, a fire on a boat can lead to the loss of life we saw this morning near Santa Cruz Island,” Feinstein said in a statement.
“We must know what fire-suppression systems and other emergency equipment are in place on these boats and whether they were in working order on the Conception. And we need to understand exactly how the crew was trained and, if they were awake and above-deck, why they were unable to alert or help rescue passengers.”
The Channel Islands National Park Service said that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department, Santa Barbara County Fire Department, United States Coast Guard are working with it as a unified command.
A one-mile safety zone was established around the perimeter of the incident while search-and-rescue efforts continue, officials said. A 3,000-foot flight restriction was also temporarily placed around the ship.
Authorities have established a Family Assistance Center at the Earl Warren Showgrounds, 3400 Calle Real, Santa Barbara, which is expected to remain open through Thursday. Information via phone is available from the Santa Barbara County Office of Emergency Management at 833-688-5551.

Ashley McBryde, 'One Night Standards'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The first single from the next Ashley McBryde album -- the follow-up to her excellent 2018 debut, "Girl Going Nowhere" -- is a catalog of lonely desperation, and the nighttime decisions you can wash off in the morning. "It's just a room key, you ain't got to lie to me/Can't you just use me like I'm using you?" she sings, not one bit melancholy. McBryde sings and writes with a high degree of emotional acuity, and this song, written by her along with Shane McAnally and Nicolette Hayford, is cleareyed, unsentimental and a cold jolt of tragical realism: "Lonely makes a heart ruthless." JON CARAMANICA
Vagabon, 'Flood'
Vagabon, 'Water Me Down'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Aqueous metaphors and blurry-edged synthesizers define two new songs that preview the next album by Laetitia Tamko, the smoky-voiced songwriter who records as Vagabon; it's due in October. Both songs are about relationships lingering too long. In "Flood," she longs for a new start without an ex-partner, lamenting, "Even if I run from it, I'm still in it" in a march with reluctance built into its beat. Meanwhile, in "Water Me Down," blippy synthesizers and a subdued four-on-the-floor beat carry mixed messages about an unexpected entanglement: "Never meant for you to love/never meant for you to trust," she notes, but she's not sure about breaking free. JON PARELES
Pusha T featuring Ms. Lauryn Hill, 'Coming Home'
Pusha T featuring Kash Doll, 'Sociopath'
For Pusha T, poet laureate of drug-dealer lore, the sins of the past are an opportunity for reflection and also celebration. So his two new songs walk parallel roads. "Sociopath," with a low, mean and skeletal Kanye West beat -- is a love story between outlaws: "All she know, if it's my hands, it's pie hands/All she want is the monograms and my bands." And "Coming Home," a collaboration with Ms. Lauryn Hill, has the lightness of gospel: "Now it's jail poses and club pictures, airbrush backdrops and jail visits/This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone/Let 'em know it's still snowing." On the first one, he's sneering and seething; on the second, he's lost in reverie. Both are true. CARAMANICA
Miguel Zenón, 'Traigo Salsa'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
How can you keep a historically freighted institution like the jazz quartet fresh? Here's one way: Set an impossible task for it, and see what happens. That's basically what's going on whenever the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón and his longtime combo unpack and expand music from Puerto Rican history. And it typically works. His latest project is "Sonero: The Music of Ismael Rivera," devoted to one of the island's great popular singers of the mid-20th century. Zenón's favorite misdirection devices are everywhere on this record -- saxophone solos that cut and then bloom, tempos that fade and disappear, sly reharmonizations. But on "Traigo Salsa," which for Rivera was a party-starting number with a classic Afro-Caribbean dance groove, Zenón plays what is, for him, a rather by-the-book rendition. The biggest reinvention work falls to Henry Cole, the quartet's drummer; his job is to take on the role that a small corps of percussionists filled on Rivera's original. And indeed, Cole plays with just enough rampant activity and invention to make you forget about the son montuno groove that he's replaced. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
ASAP Rocky, 'Babushka Boi'
ASAP Rocky's first release since the conclusion of his recent legal troubles in Sweden is "Babushka Boi," a cheerily chaotic march greatly enhanced by a hyperreal, hyperlush video inspired by the 1990 "Dick Tracy" film. CARAMANICA
Charli XCX featuring Haim, 'Warm'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Charli XCX and the sisters who harmonize as Haim can all wield full-throated voices, but they squeeze them down to Auto-Tuned husks in "Warm," set above the humming bass line and pointillistic but increasingly knotty synthesizer counterpoint of a clever A.G. Cook production. Charli XCX keeps demanding, "Tell me the reason why we can't fall in love/You got to tell me the reason why you won't open up" from someone who's involved with another woman. Maybe the vocal effects are an emotional shield. PARELES
Deb Never, 'Swimming'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The bedroom-soul singing on Deb Never's "Swimming" is the thing -- it's a little bit wounded, a little bit petulant. And that's before she starts channeling the flinty rhythms of SoundCloud-era emo-rap, rendering them with polish, not angst. This song -- from her new EP, "House on Wheels" -- has aerated, downcast production, creating an air of extremely potent mope: "I keep swimming in a pool of phony people I don't even know." CARAMANICA
Kiefer, 'May 20'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This instrumental track by Kiefer, a widely recorded keyboard sideman in and out of hip-hop, is a little out of tune, with a lurch in its beat: enough to give it ample charm as high synthesizers tone slide up and down, the bass ambles in and out of dissonance and a piano line hops around in a circle until it asserts itself as a melody. All the parts fit without sounding any less casual or jerry-built. PARELES
James Carter, 'Melodie au Crepuscule'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The old joke about James Carter -- the play-anything-backward saxophonist extraordinaire who arrived on the New York jazz scene in 1990, seeming fully formed at age 21 -- is that it must get boring to be this good. That's one way to explain why someone might think to make an entire album of tunes by the Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt with none other than a soul-jazz organ trio. In Carter's hands, this unlikely marriage yields plenty of humor, joy and fascination. On "Melodie au Crepuscule," the organist Gerard Gibbs starts by outlining the groove from Bill Withers's "Use Me," before he introduces the Reinhardt song's driftwood melody. For the rest of the track, the trio-mates sit back heavily in their saddles, jostling and provoking each other and savoring the marriage of backbeat and melody. RUSSONELLO

Rochester actor stars opposite Liam Hemsworth in 'Killerman'

Texto completo: Liam Hemsworth may be the star of the new crime thriller "Killerman," but it's the bad guy chasing him across the screen, Rochester-based Nickola Shreli, who is getting some of the film's best mentions.
Tall, bald, and showered with tattoos, Shreli plays Leon Duffo, a dirty cop out to retrieve the $2 million in cash that Hemsworth's money-laundering Moe Diamond and buddy Skunk (Emory Cohen) have in their possession. The movie opened in limited release Friday.
Shreli, 38, had substantial roles in "Hostel: Part III" and the John Singleton-directed "Abduction," but he gained real indie movie cred when he wrote, co-produced and acted in 2015's "Cash Only," the story of a man who finds stolen drug money. This first collaboration with "Killerman" director Malik Bader, shot on the fly mostly in Hamtramck, caught the attention of the New York Times, which praised its low-budget moxie.
The son of Albanian immigrants, the Detroit-born Shreli grew up in Sterling Heights and graduated from Eisenhower High School, where he says he developed his initial interest in theater and acting. He later found his way onto movie sets, including "8 Mile," where he worked with the transportation crew.
"When Eminen was riding around with a paintball gun, I was in the car behind," he says.
A move to Los Angeles got him roles in TV and movies, but he realized early that if he wanted to reach his potential as an actor, he had to also get behind the camera.
In L.A. he found a kindred spirit in Bader, the son of Palestinian immigrants, who was raised in Chicago but had an upbringing similar to Shreli's. Together they created "Cash Only." When Bader got an $8-million budget to make "Killerman" with Hemsworth, Shreli came along in a supporting role. Though he is billed fifth in the violent action film, reviews have called his portrayal "ferocious" and "feral." Trade paper Variety branded him "the dirtiest of all dirty cops."
The Free Press interviewed Shreli about his Detroit-area roots, his worries about being typecast and the frustration that comes when your hunky leading man, embroiled in a tabloid-splattered separation from wife Miley Cyrus, heads back to Australia instead of making the rounds to promote his new action film.
QUESTION: Bald badasses have been huge this summer in blockbuster movies like "Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw." What makes your villain different?
ANSWER: I think what makes Leon Duffo so badass is that there are real dirty cops like that out there, and I think we got it right. It's about being an actor going into dark places and really ... just having fun with it.
Q: There has been a lot online and in the media lately about the breakup of Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus. Does this publicity help or hurt "Killerman"?
A: It doesn't help the film because it's about the tabloid of it all. This was supposed to be a sort of transformational role for Hemsworth, the first time we were going to see him in this kind of antihero family criminal light, and he does an amazing job. ... Unfortunately, he is married to a fricking pop star. They're young. They're rich. They're famous. So things don't always work out. ... It obviously hurts the movie when the star of it isn't out there talking about it and promoting it.
Q: What was Hemsworth like to work with? You obviously had to get physical with him.
A: He showed up and did what was asked of him. He was very professional. He chipped in. He was very soft-spoken. We were sneaking him in and around Chinatown, kind of breaking the rules like we did with "Cash Only," hiding him away from paparazzi. I think he would have loved to be promoting it, talking about it, but he just caught up in the Miley of it all.
Q: John Singleton, the maverick filmmaker first known for making "Boyz in the Hood" in 1991, was someone you worked with. How did his recent passing affect you?
A: It beat me up because he helped so many people. John was the first guy that gave me a real shot with the film "Abduction." I was the villain opposite Taylor Lautner. When I told John I wanted to make a movie, he was very encouraging. A lot of these guys, they just don't have ... time. He said, "Write, write, write."
It was hard being in L.A. working the ranks. You get kind of homesick, and it's hard to make real friends. John was a mentor to me, and we spoke a lot. We talked just about two weeks before his death, and then, wow, it was a real wake-up call for me to understand just how short life is.
Q: As an Albanian-American, do you feel typecast in the kinds of roles you are given?
A: Sure, I have been cast as villains, but there were cool roles, too, like "Hostel III," where I had one of the leads. But yes, you can get pigeonholed. I decided early on that I have to make movies to show who I am. I'm not some tall, blond, blue-eyed guy, so in "Cash Only," I'm this guy from Detroit who is this kind of hack landlord. I related to that. I think everyone can relate with a character who is seriously conflicted and has made mistakes.
Q: Though you are listed primarily as an actor in "Killerman," I assume your relationship with Bader had you working closely with him behind the scenes.
A: Essentially, I was his right hand creatively. With "Cash Only," it was really run and gun in wild-west Detroit. But when you have a big budget and a big name, there are expectations; there are rules. We got to make this bigger film, but it was a learning curve for us. We thought, "Oh ... we can't work everyone these extra hours." It was a very unionized climate. He (Bader) didn't really have time to direct me since he was mostly worrying about Liam.
Q: Though it's set in the present day, "Killerman" has the feel of a 1970s Hollywood crime film. What movies inspired you?
A: I've always been a big Pacino-De Niro guy, so "Taxi Driver" and "Mean Streets" and "Heat." I love the crime genre. Where we're at now with movies, it's all really big, virtual, dinosaur superhero stuff and it's sugarcoated and overly PC. I still think that there's an appetite for smart, elevated, dramatic crime and thrillers like this.
Malik took a slower-burn '70s approach where he's showing the process of the criminal activity in a doc-style method. Just those scenes of a guy walking through the Diamond District of New York really slowly. The authentic New York feeling is something I haven't experienced at the movies in a long, long time.

Texto completo: Federal Bureau of Investigation records released Friday show that three times in early 1972 federal investigators probed threats to kill U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, at the time a leading contender within the Democratic Party for president.
It doesn't appear from the 1,038 pages of material released to the Sun Journal that the FBI ever tracked down two of the culprits. Federal prosecutors opted not to charge the other, a mentally ill man quickly found by agents.
The information, sought via a Freedom of Information request for anything in FBI files related to Muskie, contained little about the former senator himself. Muskie was a former Maine governor, Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1968 and U.S. secretary of state during the final year of President Jimmy Carter's administration.
One memorandum shows that Carter notified the FBI on April 30, 1980, that he intended to nominate Muskie to replace his current secretary of state, Cyrus Vance. Field offices were told to expedite efforts to probe the Rumford, Maine, native's background.
VETTING PROCESS BEGINS
Agents quickly fanned out to talk with friends and family members and look at Muskie's military records from World War II, among other things.
The memo to agents said that Muskie "will be required to make decisions concerning policy and personnel matters; therefore, during interviews, determine if appointee has expressed or manifested any bias or prejudice against any class of citizen, or any religious, racial or ethnic group. Also determine if appointee uses illegal drugs or abuses alcohol."
Only one negative thing turned up, records show: On Dec. 28, 1965, in the tiny town of Centreville on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Muskie was issued a criminal summons at Broadwater Farms for "attempting to take migratory water fowl with the aid of bait."
Muskie paid the $25 fine and $2.50 administrative charge before having a guilty verdict entered on the charge in 1966. It was the only charge against Muskie that investigators unearthed and it didn't have any impact on his appointment.
CONFIRMED IN 1980
Muskie was confirmed for the diplomatic post by a vote of 96-2 in the U.S. Senate on May 8, 1980.
Muskie had long been in the public eye by then, especially from the time he ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 1968 through his failed presidential bid in 1972, a period when he pushed through both the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.
That national attention no doubt played a role in the decision by an unknown letter writer in Bryantown, Maryland, to include him among four prominent Democrats who would allegedly be blown to bits in their Capitol Hill offices on May 4, 1972.
Bomb threats were taken seriously even in those less security-conscious days. A major blast in 1971 in the Capitol had caused serious damage, though no injuries.
Handwritten letters were dropped into a post office box addressed to Muskie and fellow U.S. Sens. George McGovern of South Dakota and Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. The notes to each said they were due to die along with U.S. House Speaker Carl Albert.
The letter to Muskie, opened the morning of May 4 in his office, told him the men would be killed "in your own offices."
"The bomb is supposed to be dynamite, with a contact fuse," the writer claimed in the note to Muskie. "It is pre-planned & the bomb is to be placed under chairs."
"We hope this is not going to happen, but we really hope you will check," the letter said, claiming it had been dictated by the Ouija Board.
The FBI managed to pull a couple of fingerprints off the envelope but could not match them with anyone. There is no indication in the file that agents ever found who sent the letters, who may have also sent threatening notes months earlier to Kennedy, President Richard Nixon, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
In January 1972, letters signed by a G.C. Carlton in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, told Muskie, Kennedy and U.S. Sen. Edward Brooks of Massachusetts they should be shot.
In the note to Muskie, the writer said, after offering an uncharitable view of the senator's wife, that the lawmaker "should be deported to Poland or Rome."
"Somebody should fill you and the bastard harp Kennedy full of lead," the letter read before it turned even more profane, ending with the insistence that both Kennedy and Muskie should "rot in hell."
ALIASES DISCOVERED
The FBI managed to find a few aliases from the same writer - his language was a dead giveaway - but appears to have had no success in determining his real identity.
The investigation ceased after an assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia ruled on Feb. 24, 1972, that the letter to Muskie "does not constitute a threat within the meaning and intent" of the relevant federal statute.
That same month, a caller who phoned a number of media outlets, including United Press International in the wee hours of the morning, claimed both Muskie and Alabama Gov. George Wallace had been targeted by something called the Black Underground Military for Justice, a group that authorities knew nothing about.
Agents soon tracked him down, discovering he was someone they'd spoken with before who had a mental illness and had provided useless information in other incidents. In person, he admitted he made it all up so the matter was dropped.
Muskie died in 1996 at the age of 81.

Texto completo: Democrats got complacent about protecting a core constituency, reports
The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to win support from union leaders and members on the road to the White House. "I am a union man, period," says Joe Biden. "I stand with the @Palms workers who are fighting for strong wages, comprehensive benefits, and dignity on the job," tweets Elizabeth Warren. Bernie Sanders proposes a plan to double union membership. Kamala Harris wants teachers to get a $13,500 raise.
That's a lot of labor love, considering that Democrats in general have done little to stanch union losses in the past few decades. The percentage of workers in unions is at its lowest in more than a century - down to 10.5 percent from a peak of 35 percent in 1954. Still, labor remains a traditional Democratic constituency, even though Hillary Clinton won union voters by just eight percentage points in 2016, the narrowest margin for a Democrat since 1984. Democrats want that vote back, and they particularly need it in three states that flipped from blue to red in 2016.
Picking up union and blue-collar support in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin could be critical to winning the presidency - but it will be a tough haul. Union membership in those states has fallen steeply over the past decade, and Republican lawmakers have done their utmost to hasten the decline.
Take Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's 2011 legislation to gut public-employee unions there has had a far greater effect on labor rolls than many people realize. Largely because of that anti-union law, union membership in Wisconsin has fallen at a faster rate over the past decade than in any other state, plunging by 44 percent, or 177,000 workers, since 2008. Job losses from the Great Recession also fueled the decline, and so did an anti-union-fee directive, often called a right-to-work law, passed by Walker's Republican allies in the legislature. Such provisions let employees at unionized workplaces decline to pay any dues or fees to the unions that bargain for them. This encourages some workers to quit the union and stop paying dues.
Walker insisted at the time that he wanted to hobble government employee unions for just one reason: to hold down costs on wages, health coverage and pensions. But one of Walker's top allies, Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader, let slip a partisan motive behind the law. "If we win this battle, and the money is not there under the auspices of the unions," Fitzgerald said, ". . . President Obama is going to have a much more difficult time getting elected [in 2012] and winning the state of Wisconsin." Obama won Wisconsin in 2012, but Donald Trump narrowly won it in 2016.
There are 177,000 fewer Wisconsin workers in unions, but Trump won the state by just 22,748 votes. Had those workers not left unions - and if their dues had helped fund a more robust pro-Clinton, anti-Trump message to them and others - might Clinton have won there?
The story is similar in Michigan. Between 2008 and 2018, union membership there dropped by 19 percent, or 146,000 workers, to 625,000. Trump won Michigan by just 10,704 votes. The decline in membership is largely attributable to the auto industry's hard times during the recession - and to a right-to-work law that the Republican-dominated legislature enacted in 2013. One study found that as a result of that law, Michigan's largest unions reduced political spending by $26 million, or 57 percent.
Henry Farber, a labor economist at Princeton, found that right-to-work laws, by allowing non-dues-paying "free riders," substantially shrink union treasuries. And David Ellwood, former dean of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and Glenn Fine, a former Justice Department official, found in another study that right-to-work laws, absent other factors, caused a 5 to 10 percent drop in union membership.
Roland Zullo, director of the Center for Labor and Community Studies at the University of Michigan at Dearborn, found that the share of blue-collar workers saying they had been contacted in get-out-the-vote drives fell by 11 percent after right-to-work laws were enacted. (There was no comparable effect on white-collar workers.)
In a 2018 study, James Feigenbaum of Boston University, Alexander Hertel-Fernandez of Columbia University and Vanessa Williamson of the Brookings Institution concluded that anti-union right-to-work laws caused the Democratic vote share to drop by 3.5 percent in states that passed such laws. That was far more than Trump's winning margin in Michigan (0.2 percent) and Wisconsin (0.8 percent).
The story is somewhat different in Pennsylvania because Republicans there have not been able to push through an anti-union-fee law. Still, stung by the Great Recession, Pennsylvania's unions have lost 182,000 members since 2008, falling by 21 percent to 665,000; Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes.
Many analysts attribute Clinton's loss in those three supposed blue-wall states to her failure to connect well with blue-collar voters and to Trump wowing them with impossible promises to bring all the jobs back and stop the flood of factory closings. But it certainly didn't help that, year in and year out, Republican lawmakers and their billionaire-donor allies have pushed in myriad ways to further hobble unions - through legislation and through court cases like Janus v. AFSCME Council 31, in which the Supreme Court ruled last year that teachers, police officers and other government employees can't be required to pay any dues or fees to the unions that bargain for them.
Grover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader, said that as a result of Walker's anti-union law, known as Act 10, 135,000 government workers in Wisconsin stopped paying union dues. He said this had cut union revenue by an estimated $135 million a year. Noting that other Republican governors hoped to enact similar legislation - Iowa, for instance, passed Wisconsin-like legislation in 2017 - Norquist predicted: "If Act 10 is enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics. It's that big a deal."
New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall noted in 2014 how concerned Republicans were about unions and how unconcerned many Democrats were. "A paradox of American politics," he wrote, "is that Republicans take organized labor more seriously than Democrats do. The right sees unions as a mainstay of the left, a crucial source of cash, campaign manpower and votes. . . . If Republicans and conservatives place a top priority on eviscerating labor unions, what is the Democratic Party doing to protect this core constituency? Not much."
That's changing in this election cycle. I have written about labor unions and political campaigns for more than two decades, and never have I seen so much talk among Democrats about the importance of unions and helping unions expand as I've seen among this year's presidential candidates. They saw how their party's hopes were dashed in 2016 because Clinton lost Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, key states that were longtime labor strongholds. Just as Republicans have seen that pulling down labor has been important to their political successes, Democrats are finally recognizing that building up unions and union membership could be vital to their successes in the 2020 presidential race and beyond.
The question is whether Republican legislatures have fatally stacked that deck.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: More than 100 people braved rain and traffic Friday morning to line the sides of U.S. Highway 95 in Hayden and welcome a wounded soldier to their community.
That soldier, Brian Sharp, is a U.S. Army Green Beret and sergeant who was ambushed and injured earlier this year while serving in Afghanistan. Five of his team members were either killed in the same battle or in other action in the last several months, according to a statement provided by Sharp's cousin-in-law, Kootenai County Sheriff's Sgt. Erik Hedlund.
Sharp hails from Montana, Hedlund said, but he was heading to Hayden to visit extended family.
And he and his family were surprised Thursday with the news of a police escort, Hedlund said. They continued to their destination without stopping to meet the crowd. In a statement, Hedlund explained that Sharp and his family were still recovering from injuries and the events of this year.
Sharp was awarded a Purple Heart for his service, but returned to the United States and was able to celebrate his daughter's first birthday in the hospital.
Another Green Beret with Idaho connections - Dustin Ard, an Ammon, Idaho, native - died Thursday while serving in Afghanistan, according to multiple reports.
Hedlund and fellow members of the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office organized a law enforcement escort for Sharp and his family from Stateline to Hayden. When Sharp arrived at the intersection of U.S. Highway 95 and East Lancaster Road in Hayden, the crowd that had gathered for him broke into cheers, waving homemade signs and American flags in his honor.
Ramona Grissom was one of the many Sharp supporters who had never met him. When she heard he was a wounded service member who would be visiting his family in Idaho and there was a way to show him support, Grissom took the day off work and drove from Athol to Hayden.
"Not all of us have been where he's at," she said. "But we're still behind him."
Many members of Grissom's own family have served in the military, and she said she knows that both physical and emotional wounds from deployment can stay with a soldier and their family long after they go home.
"It's not just him that's affected," she said. "It stays with the family for generations."
Janette Villagomez and her son Christian held a large American flag between them. Villagomez said her husband had wanted to show support for Sharp as well, but he couldn't get off from work the day before Labor Day weekend.
She said even though she didn't know Sharp personally, it was important that he felt welcomed and that he's supported.
"My heart goes out to them," Villagomez said. "I just hope they get a big hug from this community."
Sgt. 1st Class Will Lindsay and Spc. Joseph Collette were killed in the same ambush in which Sharp was injured.
According to an Associated Press report from shortly after the incident in March, that battle was under investigation and Collete and Lindsay were the third and fourth American military service members killed in combat in 2019. According to the New York Times' Casualty Report, the conflict was in the Kunduz Province of Afghanistan and was a joint operation with Afghan forces.
While Sharp was in recovery, his team members Master Sgt. Michael Riley and Sgt. James Johnson were also killed. More recently, Sgt. Major James "Ryan" Sartor, a mentor to Sharp, was killed as well. According to a statement from Kootenai County's Sgt. Hedlund, Sartor had saved Sharp's life and was a close friend.
As vehicles drove past the crowd of supporters, many honked their horns and some stopped to join. Lynda Putz, a Hayden resident who was driving her family to breakfast, said she initially thought the crowd was a Trump rally, but immediately joined in when she realized it was a gathering to show support for a wounded service member.
"This is why we moved to a small town," she said.
Putz said in California, where she moved from, crowds likely wouldn't gather in the middle of a workday to welcome a single soldier.
"This is how we're supposed to take care of each other," she said.
Susan Manthey, a woman who was holding two American flags in support of Sharp, said it's important for veterans to know the community is thinking about them, especially considering the mental health issues and suicide rate of returning veterans.
She said she hoped that when Sharp and his family saw the crowd gathered just for them, they'll know they're appreciated. She said the temporary discomfort of poor weather was nothing in comparison to what many service members and their families have already been through.
"Soldiers have been through worse," she said. "So we can stand in the rain for a little bit."

Texto completo: The administration is "(fast-tracking) billions of dollars' worth of construction contracts, aggressively (seizing) private land and (disregarding) environmental rules," so it can get the job done before next November.
The Washington Post
Citing current and former officials with knowledge of the matter
President Donald Trump wants a wall. It just may not be the one his supporters thought they signed up for back in 2016.
Already walled off from the truth and effectively blockaded from reality, Trump has been apparently unable to construct a barrier high enough to ward off four Democratic 2020 hopefuls who led him by double digits in a Quinnipiac University poll this week.
The Connecticut-based university's latest canvass showed former Vice President Joe Biden and senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris respectively holding 16-, 14-, 12- and 11-point advantages in hypothetical match-ups.
So, it wasn't at all surprising to see Trump, likely in response, ratcheting up his demands to finish his long-promised wall at America's southern border with Mexico.
The administration is "(fast-tracking) billions of dollars' worth of construction contracts, aggressively (seizing) private land and (disregarding) environmental rules," so it can get the job done before next November, the Washington Post reported, citing current and former officials with knowledge of the matter.
Fast-tracking contracts and blowing off environmental rules are absolutely the kind of thoughtless and willful disregard for legislative and political norms we've come to expect from this wrecking ball of a White House.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, the former real estate developer turned president is engaging in a massive government land grab, through eminent domain, so he can satisfy his edifice complex.
Trump has reportedly batted aside any regulatory or legal concerns, telling his staff (jokingly, they say, but who knows?) that he'll pardon them if they break the law on the way to finishing the wall.
But it's clear that concerns about the 2020 campaign are firing Trump's ardor to deliver on 500 miles of promised border barrier before the polls open. Trump has reportedly said failing to finish the wall would be a massive political embarrassment.
As the Post reports, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has only completed about 60 miles' worth of construction — all of it in areas that had preexisting border infrastructure.
And that's more than two years into Trump's presidency. Assuming that means there's 440 miles of construction left, that's an impossibly high bar to cross in the 14 months that remain until Election Day.
As the Post notes, the administration has rushed contracts and allowed construction companies to drag heavy equipment into environmentally sensitive areas — and justified it on national security grounds.
As if to underline the absurdity of the whole affair, Trump acknowledged to lawmakers last year that actual immigration reform and enhanced border security are more effective than a physical barrier.
But he's also remarked on the applause his tough talk on the wall gets him at his campaign rallies.
Bread, meet circuses.
We believe the two of you each know the other?
That naked calculus should be reminder enough that what really fires the president is not what's good for the nation or national security, but rather what's good for Donald J. Trump.
Such was the case in Biarritz earlier this week when the leader of the free world shed his constitutional responsibilities to shamelessly pitch his Florida golf resort to the leaders of the G7 nations like some late-night infomercial host.
In a cringeworthy moment as the world press looked on, Trump extolled the banquet rooms, parking, and seclusion of his Doral resort.
"It's got tremendous acreage, many hundreds of acres, so we can handle whatever happens," Trump said, according to the New York Times. "People are really liking it and plus it has buildings that have 50 to 70 units. And so each delegation can have its own building."
Given Trump's obsession with aesthetics and superlatives, it's no great shock to learn that he's been taking a hands-on interest in the appearance of his border wall, apparently insisting that it be painted black and be sharp and pointy on top like a medieval fortress or something.
And much like a parent who's decided to just give in and placate an overtired child, the Army Corps of Engineers is going to tell contractors to just go ahead and paint it black, the Post reported.
Maybe, someday, as Mick Jagger once sang about painting something else black, Trump will "fade away and not face facts." The rest of us, however, won't be so lucky.
Trump will build a wall. And we'll all be paying for it.

Texto completo: NEW DELHI -- With tensions rising in the disputed Kashmir region, the Indian government said Friday that it had no intention of going to war with Pakistan and that any talk of a looming conflict was simply "fearmongering."
"The present narrative of the India-Pakistan situation by Pakistan, including the possibility of a war, is intended to project an alarmist situation," said Raveesh Kumar, an Indian government spokesman. "It is far removed from the reality on the ground."
India has come under increasing criticism for its decision in early August to revoke Kashmir's autonomy and lock down the area, arresting thousands and cutting off phone and internet service to millions of people.
Pakistan also claims parts of Kashmir, a mountainous region between India and Pakistan that has been racked by unrest for decades. Many people are worried that India's moves could further inflame the area, possibly even stoking a major conflict between the two archrivals, both of which have nuclear arms.
On Friday, Imran Khan, Pakistan's prime minister, said in an op-ed in The New York Times that "if the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear-armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation."
India says Pakistan's strategy is to paint a dire picture of the situation, play up fears of nuclear war and scare the world into intervening in Kashmir, which India considers an internal matter.
Several times in the past, the two nations, which were set up at the end of British colonialism in South Asia, have gone to war over Kashmir. Tensions are rising once again along the disputed border, and many nations, including the United States, have urged Pakistan and India's leaders to negotiate.
But the bitterness is only spreading and turning more personal.
Mr. Khan has compared India's leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Nazi Germany, and in his op-ed on Friday said the world should not appease India because of "trade and business advantages." India's economy is nearly nine times bigger than Pakistan's, and many nations seem to keep that in mind, eager to do business here. Initially, the criticism of India's move on Kashmir was light.
But as the heavy restrictions have dragged on, now for almost a month, more objections were raised, particularly over mass arrests. Indian forces have rounded up more than 2,000 people, including nearly all of Kashmir's elected leadership, and are holding them in a network of prisons across India without any known charges.
The United States is "very concerned by reports of detentions and the continued restrictions on the residents of the region," said a spokeswoman at the American Embassy in New Delhi.
Indian officials insist they want to lift the restrictions as soon as possible. In some areas, authorities have reopened phone lines. But a de facto curfew remains in many places and internet service is still seen as very dangerous -- as a way for protesters to organize and for Pakistan to spread propaganda.
Indian officials said the restrictions they have imposed are based on lessons learned from past episodes of unrest in Kashmir, when huge anti-government protests degenerated into clashes with security forces that took dozens of lives.
"Our priority is that there should be no loss of lives," Mr. Kumar said. "Whatever is being done is flowing from that singular objective."
Pakistani officials have said that the Indian government has, in effect, imprisoned the entire Kashmiri population. But when it comes to Kashmir, Pakistan doesn't have the cleanest record either.
In the 1990s, Pakistan backed thousands of jihadist militants to sow chaos in the Indian-controlled parts of Kashmir. More recently, India has accused Pakistan of helping a small group of Kashmiri militants fighting against Indian rule. Pakistan is predominantly Muslim, as is Kashmir, while India is a predominantly Hindu nation.
For years, Hindu nationalists pushing for Hindu supremacy in India have had their eyes on Kashmir. The wider state of Jammu and Kashmir, which includes the restive Kashmir Valley, is India's only Muslim-majority state. Its inclusion in India's union was seen as an important symbol of India's commitment to secularism, laid out in the Indian Constitution.
But many Hindu nationalists, who are now ascendant in Indian politics, saw Kashmir as an unruly, Muslim-dominated fringe area that needed to be brought to heel.
On Aug. 5, Mr. Modi's home minister, Amit Shah, announced on the floor of Parliament that the Indian government was erasing Kashmir's autonomy, ending its statehood and dividing the territory in half.
Mr. Shah and Mr. Modi have promised this move will bring peace and prosperity. But no Kashmiri leaders were consulted, leaving countless Kashmiris furious and with little they can do.
In the weeks leading up to the announcement, thousands of Indian troops were bused into the region, adding to the hundreds of thousands of security forces already garrisoned there.
And in the hours before the announcement was made, security forces swept the valley in the middle of the night and methodically arrested elected representatives, business leaders, teachers and human rights defenders.
Critics said that even under India's tough public safety laws, the lockdown was illegal and that Mr. Modi was bending the Indian legal system to cut off any possible criticism in Kashmir and silence anyone with a voice.
On Friday, the streets of Kashmir's biggest towns were deserted. Friday is often a tense day: It is the day when many Muslims pray together, and in Kashmir rowdy protests frequently erupt as crowds stream out of mosques.
The authorities routinely beef up security on Fridays, but residents said this Friday had a much heavier presence than usual. Nearly all businesses were closed, out of a pervasive sense of fear.
One shopkeeper who had opened his store for a few hours was shot dead on Thursday. Police officials blamed the attack on militants who they said were trying to intimidate anyone from resuming anything close to a normal life.
Kashmiris are growing weary, feeling under siege, and now they are worried about getting caught in the middle of a potential war between India and Pakistan.
"Kashmir will become the battleground," said Musadiq Wani, a student. "That is the biggest fear in people's mind."

Green builders using little-known loan tool

Texto completo: Developers grappling with the cost of new laws enacted to combat climate change are taking advantage a little-known finance tool to help pay for green-building requirements.
The model for the loans, known as Property Assessed Clean Energy, was created in 2008 to fund improvements that create environmentally sustainable and resilient properties. Now, developers are turning to PACE loans to help create more energy-efficient buildings and meet tougher environmental standards.
In Omaha, Nebraska, for instance, the Capitol District, a $205 million mixed-use entertainment development, has become the latest milestone in a long-running effort to revitalize the downtown area. The project's developer, Shamrock Development, tapped a PACE program to pay for LED lighting, heat pumps, low-flow water fixtures, and other building materials and equipment to enhance energy and water efficiency.
Promoters say a PACE loan is better than conventional debt used for similar upgrades because it is typically cheaper, it has a fixed interest rate and terms are 20 to 30 years instead of three to five. Shamrock Development's $24.9 million PACE loan, for example, has an interest rate a little below 6% and a 22-year term.
What's more, unlike conventional loans, PACE financing becomes an assessment on the property. It is paid annually along with the real estate tax bill, and it transfers to new owners.
"Developers are always on the lookout for new tools to make their projects better," said Michael T. Moylan, president of Shamrock Development. "We saw that PACE was going to be good for us - it made our buildings more energy efficient, and long-term fixed-rate financing is always attractive."
Emerging from years of relative obscurity, the PACE model was used to finance $660 million of sustainable building improvements from 2016 through 2018 after funding only $208 million in the six previous years, according to PACENation, a nonprofit organization in Pleasantville, New York.
In addition, institutional investors such as Starwood Capital, Vulcan Capital and CarVal Investors are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into PACE lenders. Petros PACE Finance, a loan provider in Austin, Texas, with a national platform, announced last year that it had received billions of dollars in commitments, including a $10 million round led by the retired baseball star Alex Rodriguez.
"It's like we're holding the tiger by the tail," said Mansoor Ghori, chief executive and co-founder of Petros PACE, which originated the Capitol District loan. "Market awareness is taking hold, and volume could grow exponentially very quickly."
The PACE model originated in Berkeley, California, when the city was looking for ways to help residents pay for solar panels and other energy modifications. Financing programs for commercial properties soon followed. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have passed legislation to allow the use of PACE financing for commercial properties.
Laws fighting climate change in California, New York and elsewhere are expected to accelerate demand for PACE. "States and cities are putting a heavy burden on commercial real estate owners, who see these ambitious climate targets as unfunded mandates," said Jessica Bailey, chief executive and co-founder of Greenworks Lending, a PACE lender in Darien, Connecticut. "So PACE is a carrot to the stick that gives property owners a way to finance more energy-efficient systems."
Better yet, PACE will help developers meet the requirements of green policies without using subsidies, said Jake Baker, managing director of Starwood Sustainable Credit, an affiliate of Starwood Capital that has committed $500 millicn to CleanFund, a PACE ban platform.
"It allows market mechanisms to work," he said, "and has the best chance for success."
PACE's original mission was to finance green upgrades in existing buildings. But developers are increasingly using the programs to fund new construction and the gutting and renovation of old buildings. Lenders expect this activity to accelerate in the coming months, especially in light of PACE's flexibility and affordability.
Developers can borrow up to 20% of a project's cost in PACE funds, for example. Banks generally finance only around 60% of a project's cost, and a PACE loan can help bridge the gap. Additionally, PACE is replacing more costly financing, such as mezzanine debt. Mezzanine interest rates are around 12% or more, while PACE rates are generally 6% to 8%.
"The financial industry recognizes that as a form of commercial real estate finance, PACE is here to Stay," said Lain Gutierrez, chief executive of CleanFund, which is based in Sausalito, California. "Apart from the public policy benefits, it has intrinsic value."

Africa fires widespread, but differ from Amazon

Texto completo: DAKAR, Senegal - As the world has watched with fear and fascination the fires burning in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, satellite images show a far greater number of blazes on the African continent.
NASA has called Africa the "fire continent," home to at least 70% of the 10,000 fires burning worldwide on an average August day, though the agency says the number of fires is consistent from year to year.
While French President Emmanuel Macron has said he is considering launching an international campaign to help sub-Saharan African countries fight fires, experts say the situation there is different and not yet a growing problem - though it could become a threat in future.
Angola had almost three times more fires than Brazil over a period last week, according to NASA satellite imagery, which indicated around 6,000 fires in Angola, more than 3,000 in Congo and just over 2,000 in Brazil.
Though Angola and Congo dominate in numbers of fires, they often occur in sparsely wooded savannas and on fields cultivated by small farmers, making them less of a concern for deforestation than those in the Amazon, said Sally Archibald, a professor at Wits University in Johannesburg.
"There are fire management questions in these [African] ecosystems, but fire is part of their ecology," said Archibald, who studies fire management and savanna dynamics. "In South America, the equivalent non-forest woodlands have been largely converted to soybean agriculture already, but in Africa they are largely untransformed."
Savanna fires release carbon dioxide, but within a year the grass regrows, sucking much of the carbon out of the atmosphere again. The fires may push toward the forests, but are mostly snuffed out at that border, Archibald said, unless trees are cut down making tropical forests more vulnerable. When a tropical forest is burned, the trees die and the carbon dioxide goes up and doesn't return to the system quickly.
"The main message is: yes we have a lot of fire, but it's not bad and can be very good for the ecology," she said. "We don't know how many deforestation fires we have but the best evidence is that our forests are not decreasing, they are in fact increasing."
Most deforestation occurred in West Africa in the 19th century, Archibald said, adding that Cameroon and Gabon show increased forestation.
However, ecosystems such as the Miombo Woodlands, which covers 10% of the continent over nine countries, do need to be managed. These woodlands push up against forests and because of an increase in population, more people are planting crops along the edges.
The Miombo Network, an advisory and sustainability group that Archibald is a member of, is working with the World Bank and policymakers to make sure there is proper fire management in these areas, she said.
NASA research scientist Niels Andela also said that savanna fires have shaped Africa's landscape for thousands of years.
"Fires are therefore often a critical component of these ecosystems and are not perceived as harmful by local communities," he said. "Indeed, fires are often used for agricultural purposes, for example to keep the landscape open to support livestock, as well as sometimes as part of shifting cultivation."
Andela said deforestation isn't occurring on the same scale as in South America.
"In part that may be simply due to limitations of existing infrastructure and lack of access to global markets, processes that drive large scale agricultural expansion elsewhere," he said. "It is therefore certainly a possibility that this may change in future."

Texto completo: After a successful two-weekend run at the Center Theatre, the cast and crew of "Tuesdays with Morrie" is getting ready to go on the road for two performances at Greenville High School. The funny and heartwarming play was written by Jeffrey Hatcher and Mitch Albom and is based on the New York Times bestselling book written by Mitch Albom. Angela Bonacasa directs the Center Theatre's production.
"Tuesdays with Morrie" is the autobiographical story of Mitch Albom, an accomplished journalist, driven solely by his career, and Morrie Schwartz, his former college professor. Sixteen years after graduation, Mitch sees Morrie's appearance on "Nightline" and learns that his old professor has Lou Gehrig's Disease. Mitch is reunited with Morrie, and what starts as a simple visit turns into a weekly pilgrimage and a last class in the meaning of life.
Patrick Myers, the Center Theatre's executive director, is proud to be able to bring the play to audiences outside of Dover-Foxcroft. "'Tuesdays with Morrie' is such a wonderful story. Whether you've read the book or seen the movie, the live play will bring it to life in a whole new way. There are some very funny moments and scenes that will touch everyone in the audience. It is also an important play to help us explore how we approach the end of life and how it affects those around us. Because of this, we are partnering with Pine Tree Hospice to host discussions after each performance about end of life issues."
Myers said the Theatre is also offering special pricing to encourage parents and their adult children to see the show. Tickets are only $10, and with every paid parent ticket a child of any age can attend for free. The final two shows at Greenville High School will take place on Saturday, Sept. 7 at 7 p.m and Sunday, Sept. 8t at 2 p.m.
"Tuesdays with Morrie" is being sponsored by Dover-Foxcroft Chiropractic Center and Moosehead Cottage Resorts with additional funding provided by the Maine Humanities Council. Tickets are available at the Center Theatre and Moosehead Marine Museum, by calling the Center Theatre at 564-8943, visiting www.CenterTheatre.org or stopping in at the box office at 20 East Main Street between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays.
The Center Theatre is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission of making arts, culture, education and entertainment accessible to our rural communities.

Texto completo: The academic year is just around the corner for Wicomico County Public Schools, and Thursday's staff kickoff event allowed teachers the opportunity to get prepared.
At the Wicomico Youth & Civic Center in Salisbury, teachers from throughout the county were celebrated and spoken to about the importance of their jobs.
From kindergarten to high school, officials wanted to ensure each teacher felt appreciated.
Along with motivational videos, attempted dances from school resource officers and the presentation of a new 2020 Chevy Equinox to 2019-20 Teacher of the Year Shane Morton, one particular guest speaker highlighted the event.
Ron Clark, who has been dubbed "America's Educator" due to his dedication to the improvement of education, discussed his experiences with teaching youth throughout the country.
Clark is a New York Times best-selling author, subject of a television movie and founder of the The Ron Clark Academy in Atlanta. He has also been featured on "Oprah" and was most recently a contestant on the television show, "Survivor."
"This generous support from our community will ultimately benefit Wicomico schools, students, families and businesses. We are very fortunate to have the community's support to bring Ron Clark of The Ron Clark Academy here to speak to our entire school system," said Donna Hanlin, superintendent of schools, in a news release.
"We're excited about all of the good things that are going to come out of putting Ron Clark's inspiration into play in our schools, and we're appreciative of the Wicomico County Education Foundation and all of the sponsors that are making this happen. It's going to be an amazing morning, and an incredible school year."
Clark preached the importance of challenging kids and never shying away from an opportunity to enhance a student's knowledge.
The 2019-20 school year starts Tuesday, Sept. 3.
Ron Clark, who is known as "America's Educator" and has made appearances on "Oprah" and "Survivor," speaks at the annual Wicomico County Public Schools staff kickoff event on Thursday.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio - Purdue Pharma would devote its profits to cleaning up the devastation wrought by opioids, and the controlling Sackler family would be out, under a $10 billion to $12 billion nationwide settlement taking shape at the negotiating table, according to published reports Wednesday.
The agreement, if it comes to pass, would resolve more than 2,000 lawsuits brought against the maker of OxyContin by state and local governments.
Under the proposal on the table, Purdue Pharma would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and transform itself into a "public benefit trust corporation, with all profits from drug sales and other proceeds going to the plaintiffs, news reports said, citing a document outlining the tentative agreement.
The Wall Street Journal said the arrangement would stay in place for seven to 10 years and would be overseen by trustees named by the bankruptcy court. Details of the proposed settlement were also reported by NBC and The New York Times.
The Sacklers would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma and contribute $3 billion of their own money toward the total, the reports said. They would also sell another pharmaceutical company, Mundipharma, which would add $1.5 billion to the settlement.
In addition, Purdue Pharma would supply its addiction treatment drugs free to the public.
It was not immediately clear whether the reconstituted company would continue to sell opioids. Purdue Pharma also makes laxatives, antiseptics and dietary supplements.
- The Associated Press
In a statement, the Stamford, Connecticut-based company did not confirm any of the details but said it sees little good in years of "wasteful litigation and appeals.
"Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome, it said.
Paul Farrell Jr., a lead plaintiffs' lawyer representing local governments in the negotiations going on in Cleveland, said all sides remain under a gag order: "All we can confirm is that we are in active settlement discussions with Purdue.
Attorneys general representing several states also confirmed the accelerated negotiations.
"Our mission here has always been clear - make Purdue Pharma and the other manufacturers and distributors pay for what they did to Pennsylvania and its people, and put the Sackler family out of the opioid business for good, said Jacklin Rhoads, a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania's attorney general.
While the U.S. has many "public benefit corporations, creating one to settle a civil action would be a novel approach, said John Coffee, a law professor and director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School.
In general, public benefit corporations have charters that dictate that they operate not to maximize profits for shareholders but to benefit some other purpose, such as a charity or research, he said. Coffee said that he has never heard specifically of a "public benefit corporation trust and that it sounded like a hybrid - a business run by trustees.
The opioid overdose epidemic has killed more than 400,000 people in the U.S. since 2000 and torn apart communities. Purdue Pharma and other players in the industry have been barraged with lawsuits, with the first federal trial scheduled to start in Cleveland in two months.
Purdue has been cast by attorneys and addiction experts as a chief villain in the crisis. While its painkillers represent a very small piece of the opioid market, the lawsuits accuse it of playing a central role in creating demand for the drugs by downplaying OxyContin's addiction risks and pushing doctors hard to prescribe it.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that the Sackler family "started a national fire and has "made billions profiting from death and destruction.
The Sacklers were ranked America's 19th-richest family by Forbes magazine in 2016, with a net worth estimated at $13 billion.
In March, Purdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma over the opioid scourge.
On Monday, an Oklahoma judge found Johnson & Johnson responsible for fueling the state's opioid crisis and ordered the maker of such familiar household products as Band-Aids and baby powder to pay $572 million to help clean up the problem.
It was the first opioid lawsuit brought against the industry by a state to go to trial, and activists expressed hope the verdict would turn up the pressure on other companies to settle.
Members of the Sackler family are major philanthropists who have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and London's Tate Modern. But in recent months, institutions have come under pressure to sever ties to the Sacklers and take the family name off their walls.

DOJ inspector general condemns Comey memo leak to 'force' a special counsel

Texto completo: The Justice Department’s watchdog condemned fired FBI Director James Comey’s decision to leak contents from his memos to “force” the appointment of a special counsel, saying his scheme violated FBI rules.
The new 83-page report from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, which focused on Comey’s mishandling of the memos he made of conversations he had with President Trump in early 2017, harshly criticized Comey’s decision to remove those memos from the FBI after he was fired and to provide some contents to a friend to leak to the media. Comey testified to Congress in 2017 that he hoped leaking this information “might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.”

Comey explained to the inspector general that his desire for a special counsel stemmed from Trump tweeting that “Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversation before leaking to the press!” And the former FBI chief told Horowitz that he hoped media reports about his memos would “force DOJ likely to appoint a Special Counsel to go get the tapes.”

But Horowitz said this reasoning by Comey violated the FBI’s guidelines, making it clear that it was unacceptable for Comey to use official FBI documents to take matters into his own hands or to advance his own goals, such as sparking investigations or vindicating himself in the press.
“Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” Horowitz wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
Comey began memorializing his conversations with Trump after their first one-on-one meeting in early January 2017 at Trump Tower in New York City, where Comey told Trump about some of the “salacious” information contained in the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Clinton campaign in 2016. Comey created seven “Comey Memos” in all, spanning from Jan. 7, 2017, to April 11, 2017.

Comey was fired by Trump on May 9, 2017.

Two days after Comey’s firing, the New York Times published an article, titled “In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty. Comey Demurred,” which described information contained in Comey’s second memo related to a Jan. 27, 2017, one-on-one dinner between Comey and Trump at the White House. That article was based on two sources: One was Comey’s friend and attorney, Daniel Richman, and the other is yet unknown. This article was the basis of Trump’s “tapes” tweet the next day, on May 12, 2017.
Comey told Horowitz’s investigators that on May 16, 2017, he awoke in the middle of the night as if “struck by a lightning bolt” after realizing that if Trump had tapes of their conversations, then Comey’s version of events could be corroborated. Comey said he realized he could “actually do something” to make sure Trump didn’t destroy the alleged tapes and to ensure the tapes made their way to the Justice Department and to the public. That “something” was the leaking of information from his fourth memo to “change the game” and create “extraordinary pressure on the leadership” at the Justice Department, who Comey said he didn’t have faith in, to “appoint someone who the country can trust to go and get those tapes.”
Comey told Richman “to share the content[s] of this memo, but not the memo itself” with the New York Times, resulting in an article published that day titled, “Comey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation.”
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein caved and appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel the next day, on May 17, 2017. Comey then provided copies of his second, fourth, sixth, and seventh memos to Mueller on June 7, 2017. Ongoing litigation has revealed the extent to which Comey’s memos were used during Mueller’s investigation, which lasted nearly two years, to look into connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Horowitz concluded Comey’s leaks were “an attempt to force the Department to take official investigative actions — to appoint a Special Counsel and preserve any tapes as evidence.” Comey defended himself to the inspector general by claiming this was “something I [had] to do if I love this country ... and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI.”
“However, were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director's example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly,” the DOJ inspector general concluded.
The Justice Department declined to prosecute Comey.

EPA to roll back regulations on methane, a potent greenhouse gas

Texto completo: Washington • The Trump administration is set to announce Thursday that it intends to sharply curtail the regulation of methane emissions, a major contributor to climate change, according to an industry official with knowledge of the plan.
The Environmental Protection Agency, in a proposed rule, will aim to eliminate federal requirements that oil and gas companies install technology to inspect for and fix methane leaks from wells, pipelines and storage facilities.
The proposed rollback is particularly notable because several major energy companies have, in fact, opposed it — just as other industrial giants have opposed previous administration initiatives to dismantle climate-change and environmental rules. Some of the world’s largest auto companies have opposed Trump’s plans to let vehicles pollute more, and a number of electric utilities have opposed the relaxation of restrictions on toxic mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants.
“This is extraordinarily harmful,” Rachel Kyte, the United Nations special representative on sustainable energy, said of this and other administration efforts to undo climate regulations dating from the Obama administration. “Just at a time when the federal government’s job should be to help localities and states move faster toward cleaner energy and a cleaner economy, just at that moment when speed and scale is what’s at stake, the government is walking off the field.”
Under the proposal, methane, the main component of natural gas, would be only indirectly regulated. A separate but related category of gases, known as volatile organic compounds, would remain regulated under the new rule, and those curbs would have the side benefit of averting some methane emissions.
The new rule must go through a period of public comment and review and would most likely be finalized early next year, analysts said. The Wall Street Journal initially reported the expected rule.
Overall, carbon dioxide is the most significant greenhouse gas, but methane is a close second. It lingers in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time, but packs a bigger punch while it lasts. By some estimates, methane has 80 times the heating-trapping power of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years in the atmosphere.
Methane currently makes up nearly 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. A significant portion of that comes from the oil and gas sector.
Erik Milito, a vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing the oil and gas industry, praised the proposed rule, saying, “We think it’s a smarter way of targeting methane emissions.”
Smaller oil and gas companies have complained to the Trump administration about the Obama rule, saying it is too costly for them to perform the required leak inspections. But major oil and gas companies have called on the Trump administration to tighten restrictions on methane.
Those larger companies have invested millions of dollars to promote the use of electricity from burning natural gas, which produces about half as much carbon dioxide as coal. They fear that unrestricted leaks of methane could undermine their pitch that gas is a cleaner energy source, leading to lowered demand for the fuel.
Exxon wrote to the EPA last year urging the agency to maintain core elements of the Obama-era policy. And earlier this year Gretchen Watkins, the U.S. chairwoman for Shell, said the EPA should impose rules “that will both regulate existing methane emissions but also future methane emissions.”
Susan Dio, the chairwoman and president of BP America, wrote an op-ed article in March saying that regulating methane is the “right thing to do for the planet” and for the natural gas industry. “To maximize the climate benefits of gas — and meet the dual challenge of producing more energy with fewer emissions — we need to address its Achilles’ heel and eliminate methane emissions,” she wrote.
Ben Ratner, a senior director with the Environmental Defense Fund, a group that works closely with oil companies to track and reduce methane emissions, said that as renewable energy becomes more affordable, it could undercut the industry message that natural gas is a cleaner energy source. “The reputation of American natural gas is at the precipice, and methane rollbacks are the shove,” Ratner said.
Lee Fuller, executive vice president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said the smaller operators that his group represents could not absorb the costs that Exxon or Shell could, particularly when it came to inspecting and repairing older wells. “For these small businesses, it’s a very different economic impact.”
The methane regulation has been in the administration’s cross hairs since Trump’s earliest days in office. In March 2017, Scott Pruitt, then the EPA administrator, tried to suspend the regulation while the agency considered an alternative, but a federal appeals court ruled the move unlawful.

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(TriceEdneyWire.com) - On Sunday, the New York Times unveiled "The 1619 Project," a journalistic series in the Sunday magazine that seeks to tell the "unvarnished truth" about slavery and its impact on America's history. In 1619, just 12 years after the founding of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, the Jamestown colonists bought the first slaves, 20 to 30 enslaved Africans, from English pirates.
The Declaration of Independence, penned by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, issued America's founding creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal... end owed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
As Nikole Hannah-Jones writes in her stunning introduction in the New York Times Magazine, at 43, she is part of the first generation of Black Americans in the history of this country to be born into a society in which Blacks had equal rights of citizenship. Blacks suffered under slavery for 250 years, and brutal racial apartheid for a century more. We have been legally free for just 50.
Americans prefer not to face this reality. Our history classes address it gingerly, if at all. Even as President Donald Trump and cynical politicians stoke racial divisions for political profit, we too often look away from it. Trump has recently decided to make four young, newly elected congresswomen of color a central target of his already launched campaign for re-election, scorning them as un-American, suggesting that if they don't like America, they should go back to where they came from. This though all four are American citizens, and three were born right here.
Trump is poisonously invoking the old lie of slavery and segregation that people of color are somehow not real Americans. Yet, as Roger Wilkins wrote in his book "Jefferson's Pillow" and Hannah-Jones in her introduction, it is the freedom struggles of Black Americans that propelled the cause of equal rights for everyone. The Constitution excluded women, Native Americans and Black people, and did not provide the right to vote to most Americans.
It is the laws born out of the civil rights movement that extended the right to vote to everyone and banned discrimination; not simply on race, but on gender, nationality, religion and disability. Without the idealistic and patriotic struggle of Black Americans, as Hannah-Jones notes, "our democracy today would most likely look very different - it might not be a democracy at all."
Recently, Ken Cuccinelli, Trump's acting director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, sparked outrage when he brazenly reworded Emma Lazarus' famous poem found at the foot of the Statute of Liberty that reads "give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..." What Cuccinelli probably had no clue about is that the Statute of Liberty was a gift to the people of the United States from the people of France and was dedicated in 1886 to celebrate the national abolition of slavery.
It is the figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she strides forward, commemorating the abolition of slavery in 1865, an abolition that turned out to be the first step in America becoming in fact, as well as in word, the land of the free. In telling the "unvarnished truth" of slavery, we will face the horrors of our past, as well as the triumph of our progress. It is a telling that is long overdue.

Texto completo: CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza might be the last person in America to see it. He's shocked that the failed senatorial candidate with nothing but a dopey grin and a DWI has tanked in the polls.
Yes, really.
Tweet
Interesting. You mean to say that the self-made millionaire entrepreneur running on a concise, relevant economic platform is beating the trust fund son-in-law who sounds uncannily like Butthead from the old MTV cartoon? Could not have seen that one coming, Chris.
Beto's always been an empty suit, but in 2018, he was an empty suit running solely against a polarizing incumbent Republican in an election characterized by groundbreaking Democratic turnout. Now he's running against a bevy of candidates more experienced, more charismatic, more diligent, more intelligent, and unquestionably better looking, who all have fewer DWIs in their history. (The whole discount RFK schtick pales in comparison to the telegenic visages of Tulsi Gabbard or Kamala Harris.)
By contrast, Yang has differentiated himself from the field by putting forward an affirmative and cogent agenda focused on the economy and automation. You don't have to agree with his solution to understand its appeal.
Yang understands that a Democrat can't get back the 80,000 voters in the Rust Belt that won the Electoral College, or the millions who flipped to vote GOP in 2016, by simply disparaging as racists people who are motivated by job losses and diminished economic opportunities. Even the most ardent libertarians opposed to Yang's universal basic income proposal at least have to appreciate that it's a solution to our current economic shifts more thoughtful than punishing job creators with $15-per-hour minimum wages or exorbitantly taxing the rich for free gender-studies degrees.
If voters want an ideologically undefined Democrat who hits the right intersectional notes, they have no reason to pick Beto. They already have the far more qualified Harris or Cory Booker. Outside of the Beltway bubble, Beto was always just a privileged sad boy, waxing poetic in the pages of Vanity Fair and the New York Times about the trials and tribulations of slumming it in a Williamsburg walk-up like every other 20-something in Brooklyn. Why choose the mediocre white dude going through a public midlife crisis when you have senators who earned their place?
In contrast, Yang has carved out an intellectually interesting and unoccupied space in the primary. His campaign is as self-made as his career. He deserves every poll increasingly demonstrating that.

Justice Department inspector general has done separate report on James Comey

Texto completo: The Justice Department inspector general is preparing to release a report on the conduct of fired FBI Director James Comey in the Trump-Russia investigation, according to a number of sources with knowledge of the situation. The specific timing of the report's release is not clear.
The Comey report is separate from a larger inspector general report on the DOJ's handling of the Trump-Russia probe. That report, sometimes referred to by Republicans as an investigation into "FISA abuse," is expected to be released later.
It is not clear why the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, chose to write a separate report on Comey.
Among other things, Comey has been under investigation for his handling of several memos he wrote memorializing conversations with President Trump. The memos began in January 2017, when Trump was still president-elect, and continued until April 2017, the month before Trump summarily fired the FBI director.
Comey's memos were, at the least, confidential FBI documents, and at most, in some cases, classified. Comey told Congress that he sent some of the memos to a friend for the purpose of being leaked to the New York Times. Comey hoped media reports would set off a firestorm that would ultimately result in the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Trump-Russia matter.
That is precisely what happened with the appointment of Robert Mueller.
It is not clear what conclusions Horowitz has reached about Comey's actions. Horowitz earlier referred the Comey memo matter to the Justice Department for possible prosecution, but Justice officials declined to go forward.
Comey was also part of the process, much scrutinized by Republicans, through which the FBI sought and received a secret court warrant to wiretap short-term Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The FBI cited allegations from the now-discredited Steele dossier as part of its application for the warrant. That action drew much criticism from Republicans and was ultimately one of the main shapers of the inspector general's assignment.
Sources say the Comey report will deal just with Comey's memos and not his broader role in the Trump-Russia investigation. As for Horowitz's main report, it is still unclear precisely what it will cover and when it will be made public.

The only proper response to people who insult you on Twitter is to ignore them

Texto completo: Given President Trump has extended the Bret Stephens "bedbug" controversy into another day by tweeting about it, I thought it was a good opportunity to articulate what I believe to be the best policy for handling those who insult you on Twitter.
For those who may stumble upon this post down the road, I will briefly recount the controversy. Those who are intimately familiar with it can skip to the next paragraph. Everything started on Monday, when, in response to a report of bedbugs in the New York Times newsroom, George Washington University professor Dave Karpf joked, "The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens." Stephens responded with a bizarre letter to Karpf about civility on Twitter, which invited Karpf to dinner to meet his wife and kids and then "call me a 'bedbug' to my face." What really made things blow up was that Stephen's cc'd the university provost, essentially tattling on Karpf. To make a long story short: Stephens overreacted to what, by Twitter standards, was a mild insult, and then Twitter overreacted by piling on Stephens all day Tuesday. And with the pile on getting the presidential seal of approval, we've now entered another day of "bed bug" Twitter.
Twitter often is a toxic waste dump, to be sure. But having been active on the forum for over a decade now, the only way I've remained sane is to develop my own set of rules. And one of my main rules is the best way to respond to insults is to ignore them. I don't always follow my own rule. Sometimes, I can't resist mocking somebody who insults me. Other times, I may highlight a particularly egregious tweet to raise awareness about the anti-Semitism faced by Jewish writers. But by and large, ignoring the haters is the best response.
The way I see it, I get to be paid to offer my opinions publicly. It's natural that as an extension of that, I'm going to incur the wrath of some people who disagree with me. In the modern world, social media insults are just a natural consequence of publicly arguing about politics. Anybody who is in this business has to be able to learn to brush things off, or they're going to be really unhappy.
To my astonishment, there are some people with other day jobs, who nonetheless spend countless hours on social media harassing writers. Not sure what the motivation is for internet trolling, but as far as I can tell, the biggest goal is simply to get attention. So it doesn't make much sense to provide them with the attention they seek, or to give them the satisfaction of knowing they're getting under your skin.
Short of actual death threats, social media should be viewed as a freewheeling space where people are going to say a lot of insulting things to you, particularly if your job is to state your opinions on the internet on a daily basis.

Resumen: Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government." In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all." There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones’ article, but I’m going to focus on the article’s most serious error, namely that the nation’s founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation — the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we’d rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world’s mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world’s wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world’s most famous personalities.
In 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Wednesday mocked New York Times columnist Bret Stephens for his reaction of being called a bedbug.
In a tweet, Trump called him Stephens a "lightweight journalist" and "a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do!," before adding, "He is now quitting Twitter after being called a 'bedbug,' Tough guy!"
Trump's comments comes after a controversy that started on Monday. George Washington University associate professor David Karpf joked on Twitter that Stephens was a bedbug after reports that there was a bedbug infestation in the New York Times newsroom.
Stephens, in an email, scolded Karpf for his comment and copied the provost at the professor's university. The exchange went viral after Karpf posted a screenshot of the full email to Twitter.
“I’m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people -- people they’ve never met -- on Twitter,” Stephens wrote to Karpf. “I think you’ve set a new standard. ”
“I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a ‘bedbug’ to my face,” he continued.
Stephens, a conservative columnist, has since deactivated his Twitter account.

Many Twitter users noted Stephens has a history of defending free speech, and has even written: “Discomfort is not injury. An intellectual provocation is not a physical assault. ”
Stephens addressed the controversy in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday morning.
"There's a bad history of being analogized to insects that goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past," he said.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of a Pittsburgh-based union Monday after a Downtown stop.
The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America endorsed Sanders, a Vermont Senator who is among those leading a crowded field seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.
"Bernie understands the need for workers to have a democratic, independent union movement that is unafraid to challenge corporate America's stranglehold on our economy," said UE General President Peter Knowlton in a news release.
The UE, based in Pittsburgh, is holding its annual convention.
Sanders earned the endorsement in part for his stance on health care. The union said it shares his stance that there should be a single-payer system in the country.
"I am humbled to receive the endorsement of my union brothers and sisters from UE," Sanders said in a news release. "We are running a true working class campaign, which speaks directly to workers and confronts the massive inequality we see in our society today."
Sanders told union members he's fighting for "an economy that works for all Americans and not just the one percent," according to the news release.
It was Sanders' second visit to Pittsburgh on the campaign trail.
The UE is an independent union that represents 35,000 workers in a wide variety of manufacturing, public sector and private service-sector jobs.
A Monmouth University poll released this week shows Sanders is tied with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, each with 20% support, with former front-runner Joe Biden at 19%, according to the New York Times.
Biden kicked off his latest presidential campaign here in April.

'Call me a bedbug to my face': New York Times columnist Bret Stephens responds to professor

Resumen: A professor at The George Washington University made a joke about New York Times columnist Bret Stephens on twitter. He did not expect what came next.

Texto completo: It started with a single tweet.
“The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens. ”
George Washington University associate professor David Karpf told USA TODAY that his tweet had not gotten much attention and he was making a joke about the news that The New York Times newsroom was reportedly dealing with a bedbug infestation.
He made a dig at the conservative columnist but did not expect Stephens to have such a strong reaction, or any reaction at all. He did not even tag Stephens in the original tweet.
Then Karpf received an email from Stephens, who had copied the provost at Karpf’s university. Once Karpf posted a screenshot of the full email to Twitter, the exchange went viral.
“I’m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people -- people they’ve never met -- on Twitter,” Stephens wrote to Karpf. “I think you’ve set a new standard. ”
“I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a ‘bedbug’ to my face,” Stephens continued.
“This would have been a different thing if he didn't CC the provost; he wanted to use his social position to get me in trouble for writing a joke for him,” Karpf said in an interview with USA TODAY.
The hashtag #Bretbug started trending, and soon people were pointing out the fact that Stephens has a history of defending free speech. He has written: “Discomfort is not injury. An intellectual provocation is not a physical assault. ”
Twitter users got in on the joke, too.
"Every time Bret Stephens writes a column, it varies between why liberals are ruining college campuses, why Democrats can never win an election unless they focus on people like him, or how climate change is not real," Karpf said.
Stephens has apparently deactivated his Twitter account as of Tuesday. He did address the controversy in an interview with MSNBC. "There's a bad history of being analogized to insects that goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past," he said.
As for Karpf, he is not worried about consequences.
“I have tenure, I'm not scared of him and beyond that I haven't done a single thing,” Karpf said.
George Washington University Provost Forrest Maltzman invited Stephens to campus to speak in response.

Texto completo: Prosperity abounds
Editor: In the 2020 election, mature voters will vote Republican, as well as religious voters.
Each has learned that living a conservative, God-fearing lifestyle is what has made this country the most successful in history. That lifestyle has brought forth and brought together a respectful and intellectual America, which has worked hard, but never forgets it is our creator’s teachings that have brought us to this pinnacle.
All should be aware that their vote for conservatism is a vote against socialism, against drugs and against full-term abortions. It is a vote against the nonbelievers, whether they are foreign-born or from within our own shores, who would choose to change our beliefs and take advantage of our generosity.
More than any other nation, we allow 1 million immigrants into our country each year, to become proud Americans who will work toward making this the ideal country for their families, knowing they are welcome to reap all which they may sow.
Our nation is now more prosperous than ever, which also includes the hardworking blacks, who had been shortchanged since the demise of the great President John F. Kennedy. We look forward to their well-deserved help in 2020.

Recession rooters
Editor: The Aug. 20 editorial (“Talk won’t stop recession”) reads like The Times-Tribune’s editorial staff is rooting for such an event.
Evidence promoted by the newspaper’s staff is gleaned from The New York Times and other left-leaning media types, allegedly championing comedian Bill Maher’s recent comment that “a recession would be very worth getting rid of Donald Trump and these kinds of policies.”
Yes, manufacturing is slowing because we have created disruptions through our tariff positions. Did The Times-Tribune publish anything about the Apple CEO meeting with Trump about how Apple’s China operation is being hurt? Why are those jobs in China? Technology entrepreneur Elon Musk created Tesla jobs in China,
Does The Times-Tribune write about how the low unemployment rate, the strong dollar and black employment are at all-time highs?
Rooting for a recession is un-American. According to my sources, it eventually will happen. However, tariffs create short-term pain in an attempt to level the playing field.
As The Times-Tribune attempts to influence the 2020 election, good luck and remember this administration is anti-socialist and the newspaper’s coming endorsement of a lefty will have consequences.
JOSEPH P. DURKIN
CLARKS SUMMIT
Editor’s Note: The Times-Tribune has not expressed any desire for a recession and has not mentioned Bill Maher in any editorial.
China rising fast
Editor: Publisher Henry Luce boldly declared in 1941 that the 20th century was the American century.
The 21st century may become the Chinese century, as China has experienced economic growth that had never been seen. China is the dominant military and strategic power in Asia. Chinese naval capabilities have grown massively and its military technologies are catching up to those of the United States. Washington faces its most dynamic and powerful competition in modern history.
China is profoundly shifting the world’s balance of power economically and militarily. American companies account for 121 of the world’s largest corporations by revenue; China accounts for 119, Forbes reports. In 2020 China will dominate global big business and it seeks to become the No. 1 superpower. The U.S. and China are in a battle over the world’s economic life force, technology. It is about whose economy will drive future technology. In essence, it involves life-and-death issues of national security.
China has explicit goals of domination in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics and autonomous vehicles. In 2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping introduced his ambitious vision, the Belt and Road Initiative. China would build a network of highways, rail lines and sea routes linking Asia to Europe and Africa. The goal is global trade dominance.
Roughly 90% of goods traded internationally travel by sea. Controlling shipping lanes and ports would allow China to wield great power over the global economy. Xi said that by 2049, the communist revolution’s centennial, China will be “fully developed, rich and powerful with a military that can take on and defeat all adversaries.”
U.S. strategy to contain or transform China has failed. America should focus more on its own power and behavior, and that of its allies and partners. Otherwise, the 21st century will belong to China.

Limit radar use
Editor: If highway safety is Harrisburg’s goal, why is there no discussion about speed limits?
House Transportation Committee members surely must know the method for setting the safest speed limits. It’s a highway safety engineering principle called the 85th percentile speed. From 70 years of experience, professional highway engineers have found that the 85th percentile is the safest speed with the most compliance.
Officials in charge, though, post speed limits at 8 to 16 mph below the speeds safe drivers actually drive, according to Federal Highway Administration data. Those should be the 85th percentile speeds.
This creates a Catch-22, making almost all drivers “speeders” who are liable to tickets. This is the loophole the radar lobby wants to cash in on by giving municipal police access to radar. When everyone is “speeding” it’s like shooting fish in a barrel to use radar to unfairly ticket drivers who drive the safest speed, do nothing dangerous and harm no one.
Don’t members of the Legislature want people to drive the safest speed without getting a ticket? Of course, there also wouldn’t be any money in radar if all the limits were set at the safest speeds.
Doesn’t common sense indicate that giving radar to municipal cops is only for the money? Lawmakers can claim that there’s a cap on the revenue a town can keep, but it is still a lot of money, and all that money goes somewhere.
Tell your representative to vote no on Senate Bill 607, radar for municipal police.

Purchasing Greenland is far from absurd

Información de publicación: Messenger Inquirer ; Owensboro, Ky. [Owensboro, Ky]. 25 Aug 2019.

Texto completo: President Trump is upset that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called his interest in purchasing Greenland "absurd." Her dismissive response should have come as no surprise. In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal "seemed to come as a shock" and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.
That was a big mistake. As part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump's proposal. In 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!
With that blunder in their rearview mirror, you would think that Danish leaders would at least hear Trump out. The president's idea of buying Greenland is far from absurd. Today we have a military base in Greenland, so there is no need to buy it for that purpose. But Greenland has enormous unexplored stores of natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, diamonds, copper and uranium, that Denmark has been unable or unwilling to exploit.
It also has large, untapped stores of rare-earth elements, such as praseodymium or dysprosium, that are critical to the production of everything from electric cars to smartphones and lasers. Today, the United States gets many of these rare-earth elements from China, which makes Americans dependent on Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reports that Beijing may cut off access to those minerals in its trade dispute with Washington, and China is also trying to corner the market for rare-earth elements in Greenland. Buying Greenland would put those strategically valuable minerals in U.S. hands.
But what makes Greenland particularly valuable to the United States is global warming. The unavoidable receding of Arctic sea ice will open a new sea route in the Arctic that can be used for both commercial and military vessels. In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address at the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Finland in which he pointed out that "steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade. This could potentially slash the time it takes to travel between Asia and the West by as much as 20 days." He added that the emerging "Arctic sea lanes could become the 21st-century Suez and Panama canals."
He's right. A recent report in the New York Times notes that as sea ice melts and "Arctic routes become more direct, voyage times could fall to less than three weeks in some cases, making Arctic shipping potentially more attractive than the southern routes in coming decades."
The United States and its allies have a major interest in not allowing these Arctic sea lanes to fall under Russian or Chinese control. "Do we want the Arctic Ocean to transform into a New South China Sea, fraught with militarization and competing territorial claims?" Pompeo asked in Finland. Purchasing Greenland would help the United States to better secure these emerging strategic passageways.
In 1946, the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Truman that Greenland was "completely worthless to Denmark." Today, Denmark may not feel that way. But rather than getting offended, Copenhagen should entertain Trump's offer. After all, it would not be the first time Denmark sold the United States one of its overseas possessions. In 1916, it sold the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to President Woodrow Wilson. So, we've long ago established that parts of Denmark are for sale; there's no harm haggling over the price.
Indeed, a Greenland purchase would be in keeping with a long history of presidential land acquisitions. In 1803, Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France. In 1819, President James Monroe bought Florida from Spain. In 1854, President Franklin Pierce, in the Gadsden Purchase, bought part of New Mexico and Arizona from Mexico. In 1867, President Andrew Johnson bought Alaska from Russia. In 1898, President William McKinley bought the Philippines from Spain. And in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt rented the Panama Canal Zone from Panama and Guantanamo Bay from Cuba. If Denmark won't sell Greenland, maybe we can rent it!
On Monday, Trump tweeted a picture of a gleaming Trump high-rise amid small huts on the Greenland coast and declared, "I promise not to do this to Greenland!" But the idea of buying Greenland is no joke. It actually makes a lot of strategic and economic sense.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump is upset that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called his interest in purchasing Greenland “absurd.” Her dismissive response should have come as no surprise. In 1946, when President Harry Truman tried to purchase Greenland, Secretary of State James Byrnes wrote that the proposal “seemed to come as a shock” and an insult to Danish officials, who turned it down.
That was a big mistake. As part of his deal, Truman had offered to trade parts of the Point Barrow district of Alaska, including the rights to any oil discovered there, to Denmark, in exchange for parts of Greenland. The Danes dismissed the idea just as they did Trump’s proposal. In 1967, the richest oil strike in U.S. history was made in the Point Barrow area. Bad move, Denmark! Sad!

Texto completo: Online retailer Overstock. com is searching for a new, permanent CEO.
On Thursday, Patrick Byrne announced he was stepping down from the top role at Overstock. com, following a bizarre statement about the "deep state" and his potential involvement in an FBI investigation.
"While I believe that I did what was necessary for the good of the country, for the good of the firm, I am in the sad position of having to sever ties with Overstock. com, both as CEO and board member," wrote Byrne in a statement.
In 1999, Byrne founded Overstock. com, which has since grown into a $2 billion business, according to a bio on the company's website.
Here's what we know so far about Byrne's resignation:
Why is he resigning?
In his statement, Byrne cites his involvement in "certain government matters" for his resignation. The company statement did not elaborate on details of the government matters Byrne referenced.
What's this about the 'deep state'?
On August 12, Overstock. com issued a press release titled "Overstock. com CEO Comments on Deep State, Withholds Further Comment," during which Byrne said he somehow became involved in the "Clinton investigation" and the "Russian investigation" starting in 2015. He also discusses helping "the Men in Black," which he says he had done previously to help in the case of a friend who was murdered and to "shake up Wall Street" a decade ago.
"Unfortunately, this third time turned out to be less about law enforcement and more about political espionage conducted against Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump (and to a lesser degree, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz)," Byrne said.
Overstock. com’s shares fell 36% in the two days after the statement was made public.
Overstock CEO steps down: Resignation comes after statement about 'Deep State,' and investigations of Trump, Clinton
How is Maria Butina involved?
According to The New York Times, which interviewed Byrne, the Overstock. com CEO had become romantically involved with Butina, who was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison for participating in a Russian effort to infiltrate U. S. political organizations. Robert Driscoll, Butina's lawyer, confirmed to the Times the two were romantically involved.
In an interview with CNN, Byrne claims he was directed by the FBI to pursue a romantic relationship with Butina ahead of the 2016 election.
CNN reports no agencies have verified his claims, and neither the FBI nor Justice Department would comment. In his August 12 statement, Byrne mentions presenting information to the Justice Department in April.
What's next for Overstock. com?
Jonathan Johnson, who has worked with Overstock. com for nearly 17 years and serves on its board, was appointed interim CEO. "It will be my mission as I take the helm to continue and build on Overstock’s achievements and success," said Johnson in a statement. Overstock. com did not provide information on a search for a permanent CEO.

NASA astronaut accused of accessing her estranged wife's bank account; first alleged crime in space

Texto completo: Officials with NASA are reportedly investigating an allegation that an astronaut accessed the bank account of her estranged spouse from space, which may be the first allegation of a crime committed in space.
Anne McClain, a decorated astronaut who was once set to be part of NASA's first all-female spacewalk, allegedly accessed Summer Worden's bank account while on a six- month mission aboard the International Space Station, according to a report from The New York Times. The pair were married in 2014; Worden filed for divorce in 2018.
Worden filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission claiming McClain had stolen her identity although she saw no signs anyone had moved or used funds in the account, the Times reported. Worden's parents brought a separate complaint to NASA's Office of the Inspector General that described a "highly calculated and manipulative campaign" designed to win custody of the couple's child.
Space Force: US Space Command will launch this month, ahead of Trump's Space Force
"There’s unequivocally no truth to these claims. We’ve been going through a painful, personal separation that’s now unfortunately in the media," McClain said in a statement released on Twitter. "I appreciate the outpouring of support and will reserve comment until after the investigation. I have total confidence in the IG process. "
NASA declined to comment on personal or personnel matters involving employees but released a statement to Space. com saying "Lt Col. Anne McClain has an accomplished military career, flew combat missions in Iraq and is one of NASA's top astronauts. She did a great job on her most recent NASA mission aboard the International Space Station. "
Through her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, McClain told the Times that she had accessed the account, but insisted that she did so to ensure the family's finances were in order and that there were sufficient funds in the account to care for their child, who was born a year before they met. She claimed that she was never told to stop using the account and continued to use the same password she had throughout the relationship.

"She strenuously denies that she did anything improper," said Hardin, adding that McClain was "totally cooperating. "
The International Space Station is a joint project involving the United States, Canada, Japan, Russia and several European countries. There is a legal framework that dictates people and possessions in space are under the jurisdiction of their country of origin, according to the BBC.

Making bootlegger George Remus as big as Al Capone

Texto completo: Notorious Cincinnati bootlegger George Remus could become the face of Prohibition.
As we approach the 100th anniversary of the national experiment to ban the sale and distribution of alcohol, two new books on Remus may spread his fame beyond the Queen City.
Around here, Remus has a reputation as a sort of folk hero. Stories still float about of the lavish parties held in his Price Hill mansion, his $175,000 Grecian swimming pool with Rookwood tile and running whiskey out of his "Death Valley Farm" in Westwood.
That his life story is filled with crime, sex, betrayal and murder only adds to his luster.
"My goal is to make Remus as well-known as Capone," said Bob Batchelor, author of "The Bourbon King: The Life and Crimes of George Remus, Prohibition's Evil Genius," available Sept. 3.
Karen Abbott's "The Ghosts of Eden Park," currently on the New York Times' best-seller list, is a non-fiction thriller that centers on Remus killing his wife, Imogene, in Eden Park on Oct. 6, 1927.
That shouldn't be too much of a spoiler around here, and both Abbott and Batchelor give that away in the first few pages. The sensational trial takes up the largest sections of both books, but who these people were and what led to the murder is the tantalizing story.
"It's a story that's so amazingly twisted, so much stranger than fiction, that it has to be true," Abbott said in a recent speech.
Remus' star has been rising of late. He was prominently featured in Ken Burns' documentary "Prohibition" and was a character in the HBO television series "Boardwalk Empire."
There's even a George Remus Bourbon distilled in Lawrenceburg.
Now is Remus' time to shine once again.
Who was Remus? Batchelor's biography presents Remus as something of the quintessential Cincinnati story. A German immigrant, Remus began with nothing and rose to riches by wetting the whistles of a city that before Prohibition hit in 1920 had boasted 2,000 saloons and more than two dozen breweries.
"Remus to me still seems like a figure lost to history's dustbin," said Batchelor. "My hope was to bring him back to life, particularly for people in this region who are interested in bourbon but are not well-schooled in the history and era of what was going on 100 years ago."
Batchelor covers Remus' entire life, from his days in Chicago as a pharmacist and showboating attorney to his meteoric rise as "the king of the bootleggers" to his final days in obscurity in Covington. And he meticulously traces how Remus built – and lost – his empire.
Remus had studied the Volstead Act, which enforced Prohibition, very carefully and discovered a loophole. Since alcohol could still be used for medicinal purposes, the former pharmacist bought up distilleries to produce liquor legally, then had his own employees hijack the shipments.
As Remus himself explained, "After surveying the entire country, I picked Cincinnati as my headquarters because 80 percent of the bonded whiskey in the country was within 300 miles of that city."
He made a fortune by providing the country with something it wanted. According to Batchelor, Remus viewed himself more as a CEO of an enterprise rather than a criminal mastermind.
"Remus was really at the heart of the bourbon empire. In the earliest years of Prohibition, he is the distribution system," Batchelor said.
"You could make a factual case of Remus enabling the rise of well-known figures. Without Remus they may perhaps not have risen to the level that they did."
Murder in Eden Park Abbott was inspired by the portrayal of Remus in "Boardwalk Empire," as played by Glenn Fleshler. "George Remus was a minor character ... but he stole every scene he was in," Abbott said in a promotional video. "He was so innovative and so cuckoo. He spoke of himself in the third person."
"The Ghosts of Eden Park" reads like a novel with colorful, complex characters that you have to be reminded were real people.
Abbott interweaves testimony from the trial as she reveals the affair between Imogene and her lover, federal agent Franklin Dodge, as they plot to steal Remus' money and have him deported.
She also focuses on Mabel Walker Willebrandt – another figure worthy of more attention – the U.S. assistant attorney general who relentlessly enforced Prohibition laws and prosecuted some of the biggest bootleggers, including Remus.
The murder is also something out of fiction: a high-speed car chase from the Alms Hotel through Eden Park, the shooting near the Spring House gazebo and Remus walking into the police station, saying, "Lock me up. I've just shot my wife."
Yet it's all true.
"My goal is still for Remus to be a household name," Batchelor said. "I'd still like his role to be recognized."
Books on Remus "The Ghosts of Eden Park: The Bootleg King, the Women Who Pursued Him, and the Murder That Shocked Jazz-Age America" by Karen Abbott.
"The Bourbon King: The Life and Crimes of George Remus, Prohibition's Evil Genius" by Bob Batchelor.

Texto completo: Controversial former Illinois U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh is leaning toward a challenge for the 2020 Republican nomination against President Donald Trump, and a firm decision will come in the next few days, his team said Friday.
"He is taking steps toward a run" for president, Lucy Caldwell, a political adviser to Walsh, told the Tribune. The tea party-backed Republican will make an announcement in the coming days, Caldwell said.
Walsh, who's now a conservative radio talk show host, has scheduled a Sunday appearance on the ABC politics news show "This Week With George Stephanopoulos," Caldwell said. Caldwell declined to say whether an announcement might come Sunday, and Walsh declined to speak to the Tribune on the record.
For two weeks, Walsh has been paving the way for what many political observers say would be a long-shot attempt to wrest control of the GOP from Trump, who has maintained his popularity among his Republican base.
Walsh, who publicly supported Trump during his 2016 campaign, has been doing a national media tour for the last two weeks, making appearances on CNN. He also recently wrote a stinging piece about Trump in The New York Times.
"This guy is unfit to be president. Some Republican has to stand up and say that. He's got to be challenged by somebody ... for the sake of the party and the country," Walsh told the Tribune earlier this week.
In The New York Times op-ed published last week, Walsh accused Trump of being "a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects."
The White House did not answer emails seeking comment about Walsh's criticism.
Walsh, too, has a reputation for making incendiary comments. He was once suspended from his WIND AM-560 evening radio show for using a racial slur. He doesn't deny his past actions, but says the president's own controversial comments have served as a "road to Damascus moment for me."
He said the Times piece he penned was not just a call to action for Republicans to step up and run against Trump, but also a mea culpa.
"So why did I write that piece? I want to apologize for the role I've played in putting what I feel is an unfit con man in the White House," he told the Tribune on Monday. "There were times when I moved away from policy and got ugly and personal, made some comments about Obama, my political opponents, that were personal and hateful. In a weird way, seeing Donald Trump these last 2 1/2 years, he's the ugly final personification of that because ... all he does is ugly personal insults. It's made me think, 'Oh my gosh, did people like me who got ugly and personal these last eight or nine years create this monster?' And I think to a degree it did."
During that interview and a subsequent discussion with the Tribune on Wednesday he said he "wasn't ruling anything out" when asked if he was going to run. He said he'd make a decision by September. But his adviser is now indicating his decision may be imminent. The 57-year-old Mundelein resident waved off questions about whether he could do the kind of fundraising needed to spread his name and message. And he'll likely need the money to fend off criticism of his past remarks and of a child support battle with his ex-wife. He and his ex-wife eventually resolved the dispute, which included a stipulation that he was never "a deadbeat dad."
Recent polling shows Trump likely would win the Republican nomination in a landslide. His only challenger right now is former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld. As The Hill noted in a recent story, "a RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Trump has a 72-point lead over Weld."
But a new poll released Thursday by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found just 36% of Americans approve of his job performance, while 62% disapprove.
Walsh was in Congress representing a district that encompassed parts of suburban Cook, DuPage and Kane counties. He lost reelection in 2012 to Tammy Duckworth, who now is one of Illinois' U.S. senators.
Ahead of the 2016 election he backed Trump and sent out a comment on Twitter that drew fierce criticism: "On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket."
So what's causing him now to campaign against Trump on Twitter and elsewhere? Walsh said it was when Trump stood with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last year, seemingly accepting Putin's assertion that his government hadn't interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. That's despite U.S. intelligence presenting evidence to the contrary, Walsh said.
"When he stood in front of the world and said I believe this guy (Putin) and not my own intelligence agency, he lost me," Walsh said of the 2018 Trump-Putin meeting. Besieged by criticism, the president would later say he misspoke.

Traditional and crossover tacos take center stage at stylish Bird &amp; Co. The ordering trick at this neighborhood spot is knowing which to select and which to avoid.

Texto completo: At a lattice-topped patio table outside Bird & Co., a couple lingered over their churro strawberry shortcake ($9), spooning whipped cream and macerated fresh strawberries from the dish so slowly, the plate appeared untouched 10 minutes after being delivered. Both diners seemed to be avoiding the husky, sugar-dusted churros entirely.
A little boy just inside the plate glass window had exhausted his patience waiting for the couple to finish. "Dad," he said to a man nursing a salt-rimmed margarita ($9), "Go stand over them and breathe heavy or something. It's too loud in here. It's making my head hurt."
I sympathized. My own party of two adults and two pre-teens was corralled into the same geometric oddity of seating at the front of the Deering Street restaurant. Positioned so that each of us somehow wound up facing a different direction, we could neither see one another, nor make ourselves heard above the pandemonium.
The wall of glossy gray subway tiles, concrete bar and faux-concrete flooring all ensure that the room will never be especially quiet. But with nothing apart from a few throw pillows and a banquette cushion to absorb the clamor of 40-ish customers scarfing tacos and downing cocktails, Bird & Co. might well be the single loudest restaurant I have visited in Portland.
Which is not to say the space isn't attractive. Designed in what chef and co-owner Wills Dowd describes as a "Southwestern industrial" style, Bird & Co. feels like a major upgrade to the shag-carpeted, 1970s rec-room vibe of its predecessor, Abilene. The hard-edged dÃ©cor also fits with Woodfords Corner's charmingly schizophrenic relationship with zoning and development -- is it residential? Commercial? Both? Is it time to dig up the street again?
Dowd, who trained at Ocho Mexican Grill in Southern California and at Boone's in Portland, possesses particular insight into this part of Portland. He grew up in a house just a few blocks away.
"My parents still live there, actually," he said. "That's one of the reasons why we picked this location after we shopped around for six months. It's nice even though the parking is tough here. But it's great to look up and see my cousins all walk down to eat at our neighborhood taco spot."
Judging by the enormity of the crowds and frequent extended waits for a table, word has spread far beyond Dowd's childhood neighbors and extended family.
Most diners during my recent Tuesday night visit followed the same ordering pattern: a few tacos, something from the "not tacos" appetizer section of the menu and a cocktail or beer. My guests (well, the adult one) and I followed suit.
Choosing among the dozen taco options can be tricky. Some are traditional, like the slow-roasted pork shoulder carnitas ($4), which gets a lift from pickled onions and avocado crema. Or a lighter version of the same taco made with nearly identical toppings, just substituting smoky grilled chicken breast for the pork ($4). I could have happily eaten another two of each.
Then there's a food-truck classic from San Diego, the California ($6), which layers the restaurant's bland guacamole with pico de gallo, sour cream, tough carne asada and French fries, all bundled into a flour tortilla. As I chewed (and chewed), I kept wishing the kitchen had thrown in a little more onion and had taken time to slice the skirt steak across the grain of the meat.
Others play with fillings but still hew conceptually close to the idea of a taco: creamy avocado chunks tossed in a New England-style clam breading, then deep-fried and piled with a salsa of roasted corn and black beans ($5) offered a hearty, well-executed vegetarian option. Another, a Valentina hot sauce-seasoned buffalo fried cauliflower taco ($5) missed the mark. Loaded with both undercooked cauliflower and the same too-crunchy deep-fried Brussels sprouts I tasted as a cilantro-lime-vinaigrette-dressed appetizer ($9), it was greasy and hard to eat.
Explore further, and you'll find tacos that, for better or worse, are inspired by Asian ingredients and techniques. There's a Chinese-influenced duck breast taco ($6), scented with five-spice powder and topped with the bizarre combo of arugula and plum sauce. To my surprise, it was pretty decent, despite the liver-y off-flavors that come when duck is cooked too long (nearly four hours, in this case).
That same organ meat flavor would have been right at home in the banh mi taco ($5), which had none of the funk traditionally provided by a smear of ptÃ©, instead mainly bright, herbal flavors from lemongrass-and-fish-sauce-marinated pork shoulder, pickled carrots, and something mysterious that Dowd would only describe as "Asian marinade."
Bird & Co.'s most successful crossover taco might also be its weirdest: a fried flour tortilla filled to bursting with a pokÃ©-style medley of avocado, wasabi microgreens, pickled radish and cubes of raw yellowfin tuna from Harbor Fish Market ($7). "People know they like raw tuna, and this gives them a way to have it and get some crunch from the flour shell. You don't see that too often in Maine," Dowd said.
Another dish that is rare around here is elotes, Mexican-style corn-on-the-cob. Bird & Co.'s version ($7) relies on mostly traditional ingredients like paprika, savory cotija cheese and cilantro, but it goes overboard in the sheer volume of glop slathered on the steamed cobs. Mine had a layer of lime-mayonnaise as thick as the kernels themselves. As I ate, globules slipped off the hot corn onto the plate, the table, and my lap.
More is not necessarily better.
I imagine that couple on the patio, dawdling, not eating their churro strawberry shortcake (much to my young neighbor's consternation) must have reached the same conclusion. In both the fruit-and-cream preparation and served on their own, rolled in cinnamon-sugar and accompanied by a tiny pot of bittersweet hot fudge ($6), Bird & Co.'s churros are too large for their own good.
Leave a too-chubby churro in bubbling oil long enough to cook its custardy interior, and you'll wind up with an exterior shell that could stop a bullet.
Just ask the kids at my own table who made a few attempts to devour the churros we ordered, then gave up to focus on the fudge and whipped cream. "I can't do it," one declared with a dramatic sigh. "It's making my head hurt."

Texto completo: What's on TV
ON BECOMING A GOD IN CENTRAL FLORIDA 10 p.m. on Showtime. Following in the same tradition as shows like "Breaking Bad," "Weeds" and "Ozark," this dark comedy series focuses on the often disastrous lengths that a person will go to achieve their version of the American dream. In this iteration, drug trafficking is swapped for the nefarious trappings of a multilevel marketing scheme, one that leaves Krystal Stubbs (Kirsten Dunst), a Florida water park employee, destitute after her husband (a mulleted Alexander Skarsgard) goes all in. Using her gumption and business savvy, Stubbs cons her way up the cultlike pyramid scheme with help from one of its loyal followers (Théodore Pellerin), only to wreak havoc on those closest to her. The series's oddball Florida setting, ostentatious 1990s fashion and colorful characters creates room for it to join some of the most delightfully weird shows on TV right now, like AMC's "Lodge 49" and HBO's "Los Espookys."
POWER 8 p.m. on Starz. This network's most-watched franchise picks up for its sixth season. Ghost (Omari Hardwick) attempts to get even with Tommy, tries to make headway on the Queens Child Project and works to cut ties with his criminal past. At the same time, the Feds are growing closer to convicting him. In this season, 50 Cent, who also serves as the show's executive producer, will make his directorial debut.
HALSTON 9 p.m. on CNN. For those who have ever wondered who was behind Jackie Kennedy's pillbox hat, this documentary delves into that titan of American fashion, the designer Roy Halston Frowick, or Halston. The film, Wesley Morris wrote in his New York Times review, is about how "this ambitious, soap-opera handsome, emotionally opaque man went from Iowan to New Yorker, from serf at Bergdorf Goodman to Merlin of American fashion to shuttlecock in corporate-takeover badminton." The film charts Halston's rise, first dressing the A-list stars of the Studio 54 era, and then championing ready-to-wear clothing for the modern American woman through a deal with J.C. Penney.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
JAWLINE Stream on Hulu. Thanks to TikTok, Instagram and YouTube, becoming famous can be as easy as making one viral video, cultivating a following with a charming personality or posting flattering photos online. Although the bar may be low, breaking into the influencer world and turning it into a lucrative career can be a grind all its own. In her feature debut, the filmmaker Liza Mandelup wades into the crowded ecosystem of teenagers vying for viral fame, focusing on Austyn Tester, a 16-year-old using his good looks and limited resources to achieve celebrity status and leave his home in rural Tennessee. The film captures the toll his dream takes on his family, the hours he spends making videos for his fans, the girls who pay cash to mingle with him in person and the managers flocking to represent new talent.

She Likes It! Hold On, Maybe She Doesn't. Wait...!

Texto completo: Brittany Tomlinson hit record on her iPhone and cracked open a can of kombucha for the first time.
She hated it. Then she loved it. Then she didn't know how she felt. She still isn't sure.
"Low-key it's kind of good, but it's nasty," Ms. Tomlinson said in an interview, continuing to waffle.
However indecisive Ms. Tomlinson may be about the fermented beverage, her facial expressions in a video of her reaction were decidedly pointed. First, disgust. Then, a reconsideration. A shake of her head seems to confirm her initial reaction: She hates the drink. Wait -- maybe not. "Well ..." she says, tilting her head. She giggles at herself, smirks, and the video ends.
"It's an amazing sequence," said Dr. Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies facial expression and watched the video at the request of The New York Times. He was delighted.
"Her expressions are exceptional -- easy to see and rich," he said.
The clarity of this rapid fire of emotional expression may be why the video has ricocheted around the internet, racking up more than 40 million views on Twitter alone after it was shared from her TikTok account. It has seemed to resonate with anyone who's ever vacillated between pajamas and club clothes on a Friday night.
Online, people have used the video to describe every scenario imaginable, from the emotional roller coaster of trying alcohol for the first time to deciding whether to ignore the groceries you just bought and eat Taco Bell for dinner (again). Ms. Tomlinson can't even scroll through Twitter without seeing herself.
"Have you ever looked at your face for too long? That's what it's like," she said of her moment. "I'm sick of seeing my face."
Ms. Tomlinson, 22, is a recent Texas A&M graduate and works at a bank near Dallas, where she grew up.
She saw two YouTube stars talking about kombucha and decided she needed to try it herself. She drove to the closest Walmart and picked up a can of cherry-cola-flavored kombucha. (Probably not the best choice, she admitted.)
Then she recorded her reaction to the drink, which she insists was completely genuine.
Dr. Keltner said Ms. Tomlinson displayed between five and seven different identifiable emotions, and that her expressions may be so enjoyable to watch because they are self-effacing.
"Let's give her some credit. She's kind of laughing at herself," Dr. Keltner said. "And then that silly face at the end speaks to a playful quality to her character."
Humans can change their facial expressions multiple times each second; it's less common for the evolution to be so convincing and captured on camera.
"In reality, this stuff goes on all the time, but you're watching the person's mind process in real time, which is really cool," said Dr. David Matsumoto, a psychology professor at San Francisco State University who also studies facial expressions.
Now that we've heard from the experts, how would Ms. Tomlinson describe the dramatic structure of her TikTok video?
"The six stages of grief," she said, deadpan, before her infectious laugh crept out.
The drink "was not satisfying in any way," she said, though she'll try it again.
"That's the whole essence of this," she said. "Why do we hate something and keep doing it? Like working 9 to 5, drinking alcohol or hanging out with people you don't like. It's all the same thing."
It was a pretty big deal for Ms. Tomlinson when Billie Eilish, the singer, liked her video, or when Demetrius Harmon, the online video star, tweeted it out. But that wasn't when Ms. Tomlinson knew she'd made it.
"Someone had shown it to Nana," she said, referring to her grandmother. "And I knew it was over. Instantly, it wasn't funny anymore."
"I showed my boss before someone else could," she added. "I said, 'Listen, I want you to see this before someone else shows it to you. Please don't fire me."' (Her boss thought it was funny.)
Ms. Tomlinson said several kombucha companies have offered to send her drinks, all claiming that she would like their version more than the one she tried. She has obliged, and is considering making a YouTube video rating each brand.
"If they send it to me, I'm going to be honest," she said. "They're not paying me. Yet."
She paused, then said: "Wink wink." Her specialty is facial expressions; a phone interview probably wasn't ideal.

Texto completo: DAKAR, Senegal - In the most controversial scene of "Mistress of a Married Man," a hugely popular new television series in Senegal, the show's protagonist, Mareme, dons a daring magenta pantsuit and heads out for a date with a married man - but not before pointing below her belt.
"This is mine," she tells her best friend. "I give it to whomever I please."
The series, which debuted in January, has quickly reached a "Sex and the City" level of popularity, setting off a fierce debate over contemporary womanhood in a largely Muslim West African nation that, like much of the region, is urbanizing at breakneck speed. The pilot alone has received more than 3 million views on YouTube, a number nearly equivalent to the entire population of Senegal's capital region.
In a country where women's sexuality has often been hidden behind a culture of discretion, Mareme's pronouncement, fans say, was nothing short of rebellion. And it fits into a larger movement by women to assert their independence. The show takes on not just feminine desire, but also rape, mental illness, male power, domestic violence and the jealousies that arise out of polygamy.
It is part of a burst of woman-driven television and film production across Africa in which writers, producers and actors openly assert female sexuality, challenge traditional gender roles and present distinctly African stories to African audiences.
There has been some pushback, from both official sources and everyday viewers. In Senegal, a state regulator has threatened a broadcast ban of "Mistress of a Married Man," citing content likely to harm the "preservation of cultural identities."
"Mistress of a Married Man" airs twice a week on YouTube and on the channel 2STV. It is the brainchild of Kalista Sy, 34, a former television journalist who wrote the pilot after typing "How do you write a script?" into Google.
The show is loosely centered on Mareme Dial, played by Halimatou Gadji, and four other women, many of whom work at SenegIndia, a real-life construction company building a real-life city outside Dakar that has become a symbol of the region's rapid growth. Seneglndia is one of the show's major sponsors.
Besides Mareme, who is sleeping with Cheikh, there is Racky, a construction supervisor who wears a hard hat and is propositioned by her boss; Djalika, a successful professional with an abusive, alcoholic husband whom she eventually divorces; and Lalla, Cheikh's wife, who spirals mentally when Cheikh eventually takes Mareme as a second wife. (There is also a woman named Dior who is a lesser player.)
At her home in Dakar's Ouest Foire neighborhood, Sy said she had grown tired of female characters written by men or by outsiders. She wanted to see the women she knew - their good sides, their bad sides, their complexity - depicted on screen.
"I'm doing something very Senegalese," she said. "It's for Senegalese people first, then for the world."
Senegal, a nation of about 16 million people that is pushing to become a top economic player in the region, practices a form of Islam that President Macky Sail has called moderate and tolerant. In public, many women are free to run along the beach in tank tops, go to university and lead professional lives. But in the home, men often retain power.
Some men take two wives or more, but for women, sexuality often remains hidden behind a culture of "sutura" - a Wolof term suggestive of discretion and modesty.
The country has a rich cinematic tradition, but television has often been dominated by series from the United States, telenovelas from Latin America and programming from Nollywood, in Nigeria.
In the last decade, stations have begun to favor local work, but those shows have been written mostly by men. And they often present women in subservient roles, with characters going to great effort to keep their husbands, regardless of abuse or cheating, notes Marame Gueye, a Senegalese professor who teaches African literature at East Carolina University.
Sy grew up in a traditional Fulani family. She started writing "Mistress of a Married Man" as a serial novel on a group Facebook page; it was later picked up by a production company called Marodi TV.
Sy's characters, at her direction, favor Senegalese designers - wearing fluted blouses and colorful prints from NuNu and Sisters of Afrika - and natural hairstyles; they reject the practice of skin bleaching. They also speak Wolof, the language preferred by many in what is officially a Francophone nation.

Seth Moulton drops out of 2020 presidential race

Texto completo: Seth Moulton ended his Democratic presidential bid today, becoming the latest candidate to drop out of the race.
The Massachusetts congressman announced the end of his campaign an interview with the New York Times published Friday and had planned to announce the end of his bid in a speech to the Democratic National Committee today. He said he has no immediate plans to endorse another candidate, but he praised former Vice President Joe Biden. Moulton suggested most of the crowded presidential field has little chance of securing the Democratic presidential nomination outside of Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
“I think it’s evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders, and really it’s a debate about how far left the party should go,” Moulton said.

Moulton plans to relaunch his veterans and military-focused political action committee, Serve America.
A Marine Corps veteran who served multiple tours in Iraq, Moulton never gained momentum for his presidential campaign since announcing his candidacy in late April.
Moulton did not appear on the Democratic presidential debate stages in June or July due to low polling and poor fundraising. He raised about $1.2 million through the end of June, tens of millions behind top-tier candidates, and consistently polled at 0%.
Through his presidential campaign, Moulton condemned the Democratic Party’s move leftward, opened up about his challenges with post-traumatic stress disorder, and challenged former Biden to apologize for his Iraq War vote.
In May, Moulton said that the U.S. is not a socialist country and that a socialist candidate would not win the presidential race.
“There are elements of our party that are going too far toward socialism. The fact that I, as a Democrat, get asked now in interviews like this, ‘Are you a socialist?’ I mean, I never even imagined that a few years ago. Give me a break, I’m a Democrat, not a socialist,” Moulton said.
Later that month, Moulton revealed in an interview that he struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder.
"I had some particular experiences or regrets from the war that I just thought about every day, and occasionally I’d have bad dreams or wake up in a cold sweat," Moulton told Politico. "But because these experiences weren’t debilitating — I didn’t feel suicidal or completely withdrawn, and I was doing fine in school — it took me a while to appreciate that I was dealing with post-traumatic stress and I was dealing with an experience that a lot of other veterans have.”
After Biden reversed his stance in June to oppose the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funds from being spent on abortion services, Moulton applauded his new stance and challenged Biden to say that his 2003 vote in support of invading Iraq was a mistake.
Tweet
Moulton, a member of the House Armed Services and Budget committees, earned an endorsement in July from retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led the International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan under President Barack Obama but resigned in 2010 following a Rolling Stone profile that included comments from him criticizing then-Vice President Joe Biden and other civilian officials.
“I've known him for years, it's as much personal as political," McChrystal said at the time. The retired general had previously endorsed Moulton’s 2014 congressional bid.
Moulton faces Democratic primary challengers for his congressional seat, including Salem City Councilor Lisa Peterson and Salem State University trustee Jamie Zahlaway Belsito.

Texto completo: Hoodwinked by the 'moderate' Democrat
In her op-ed “A dilemma for the Democrats" (Opinion, Aug. 19), which discusses the importance of “moderate" Democrats — purportedly the sole electable variety — prevailing in intraparty politics, Diane Hessan gets a lot wrong.
In the wake of the right-wing tidal wave kicked off by Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and his allies pulled off, and consolidated, a pro-corporate takeover of the Democratic Party. Liberals and their agenda were sent packing. Clintonite “New Democrats," nearly as obsessed as the GOP with upward redistribution of capital, slashing the safety net, and imperial warmongering, since have ruled the roost. These Democrats described their sharp rightward pivot as “moderate," “centrist," and “pragmatic."
Since then, the political landscape has been dominated by what is essentially a right-wing big-business party and a farther right-wing big-business party. The parties' substantially overlapping policies have given us monopoly concentrations of wealth and power surpassing the Gilded Age. This has left the middle class economically hollowed out and the interests of the entire popular majority politically unrepresented. One probable effect of these causes was that in 2016 the electorate erupted in unprecedented, though confused, rage at both parties.
This status quo is what many people — and of course the New Democratic establishment — defend as “moderate." As cited in Hessan's op-ed, political observers across the spectrum paint a relatively tame and vanilla liberal opposition to this brave new dystopian order with such words as “crazy," “radical," “hateful," “extreme," and “socialist." It might just be that the most devastating and unprincipled tactic of so-called moderate Democrats and, indeed, the great bulk of the political class is the Orwellian perversion of language.
James Taff
Roslindale
'Hateful'? 'Radical'? That's Democrats they're describing?
I always get frustrated reading Diane Hessan's voter surveys. The voters in her sample don't like the “hateful" and the “radical," so they'd rather vote for Donald Trump, the most hateful, radical candidate out there, than they would for any of the Democrats?
One asks, “Do we have to call everything racist?" No, but we do have to call racists racist. “Do we have to blame everything on rich people?" No, just the economic imbalance caused by Trump's tax policies. “Do we have to spend all of our time investigating?" No, but we have to investigate things that need investigating. It wouldn't take so much time if the Trump administration cooperated more.
Why is the far left too “radical," but the far right isn't?
Steven Brooks
Whitman
Buttigieg is the candidate to bridge our divide
Pete Buttigieg is that fresh face of whom Diane Hessan speaks. He actively reaches out to those who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 with a message of hope and unity. He is the one candidate I have seen who has those “common-sense, less hateful messages that both Democrats and Republicans could support." I am supporting Buttigieg because I think that this is the message that will win the presidency and be a salve for the divisiveness that currently exists in our country.
LeeAnn Dobro
Attleboro
We can't read too much into views of this panel of voters
Diane Hessan's op-eds are always interesting, as she reports on the opinions of her panel of 500 voters, identified and followed over several years. But she (and we) should be careful not to interpret her voters' opinions as being necessarily reflective of voters in general, in the way that a succession of random polls would.
The reason we can have trust in a good poll is that statistical analysis informs us how likely it is that the opinions of the sample differ from those of the population as a whole. But that analysis depends on the poll using a truly random sample. Using basically the same group for the sample every time is not good strategy for statistically valid polling.
We should still be interested in the opinions of her voters, but we must be careful not to read too much into her data.

DREAM DIES HARD FORMER NEW YORK TIMES STYLE EDITOR PUTS HISTORIC GRANITE BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN UP FOR SALE

Texto completo: For nearly 14 years, Holly Brubach, a former New York Times style editor, held on to the dream of redeveloping a majestic old Downtown building in her hometown of Pittsburgh.
But with money running low and banks unwilling to help, Ms. Brubach has decided to let it go. This is one dream that will die hard.
"I would say I was really sorry not to make this work," she said. "It was exciting for me to come back to my hometown and do something for the good of the city."
After failing in her bids to convert the historic Granite Building into condos and then a boutique hotel, Ms. Brubach has decided to sell the property located at Wood Street and Sixth Avenue next to the Duquesne Club.
She admits that it's hard to walk away after investing so much time - and money - into a project that was dear to her heart.
"I couldn't keep it up. I'm one person. I'm not a huge development corporation. Financially, it got too tough for me," she said.
Ms. Brubach bought the slender and ornate Granite Building, designed in the same Richardsonian Romanesque style as the Allegheny County Courthouse, in December 2005 for $925,000.
She did so with the intent of converting the nine-story structure into condominiums during the first wave of residential building in Downtown. She used some of her own money to demolish parts of the interior to create open floor plates for the handful of condos planned.
But then the recession hit and two of the buyers Ms. Brubach had lined up for the units backed out. Another impediment was the lack of integral parking, which was never much of an issue in New York.
"Everybody wants parking in their building in Pittsburgh. I just didn't anticipate that," she said.
By 2014, Ms. Brubach had changed course, ditching the condos in favor a 104-room boutique hotel with three bars and a brasserie-style restaurant.
She secured a $2.5 million state grant for the $38 million project and hoped to have the hotel completed by September 2016.
But like the condo endeavor, her timing proved to be less than impeccable. She launched the project in the midst of a hotel boom Downtown when more than 1,000 rooms were either under construction or in the pipeline.
That made bankers skittish, even as Ms. Brubach tried to sell her independent hotel as an alternative to the cookie-cutter chain brands moving into the city's core.
"We couldn't get the banks to buy in. All they were paying attention to were daily rate and occupancy. All of those numbers were going down," she said. "That was a case of poor timing, I think."
Ms. Brubach poured some of her own retirement savings into the project but could do so no more. With the banks refusing to budge, she decided to list the property for sale.
The Granite Building, built in 1889-90 to house the German National Bank and to serve immigrants, is being marketed by the Cushman&Wakefield/Grant Street Associates real estate firm.
After being listed for about two weeks, it already is attracting considerable interest, not only from potential local buyers but others as far away as New York and Vancouver, said John Jackson, the Cushman&Wakefield senior vice president handling the sale.
"We've gotten bonafide legitimate offers for the property," he said. "I don't think any of the offers we've received have been bad. I feel good about them."
At the same time, he and Ms. Brubach will take their time in sorting through offers, saying it is still early in the process.
"I need to sell this, obviously, for personal financial reasons, but it's not a fire sale," she said.
Mr. Jackson said those who have expressed interest so far see potential residential, hospitality, or office uses for the building. "I think it will end being a residential or hospitality user," he said.
Sadly, those are the same two avenues Ms. Brubach had explored.
She is now back to writing, with a book project to keep her busy. She's ready to close the book on her foray into development.
"This experience has cost me a lot," Ms. Brubach said. "It would give me pause before I would step in and buy another property, I think."

President apologizes for MIT's Epstein ties

Texto completo: MIT's president on Thursday disclosed that the school had received about $800,000 from foundations controlled by Jeffrey Epstein, the deceased financier who was charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors, and offered a “profound and humble" apology to Epstein's victims on behalf of the university.
In a letter to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community, school president L. Rafael Reif said, “With hindsight, we recognize with shame and distress that we allowed MIT to contribute to the elevation of his reputation, which in turn served to distract from his horrifying acts. No apology can undo that."
Reif said he has asked for a group to be formed to look at “the facts around the Epstein donations and identify any lessons for the future, to review our current processes and to advise me on appropriate ways we might improve them." He also pledged to commit a monetary amount equal to the funds MIT received from Epstein's foundations to a charity that benefits Epstein's victims or other victims of sexual abuse.
The statement — released Thursday night — follows days of controversy over Epstein's donations to the MIT Media Lab. Two researchers said recently that they were severing their ties to the lab because of the donations.
Epstein, who was convicted in 2008 of procuring an underage girl for prostitution, was found dead this month in his cell at a federal detention facility in Manhattan, where he was held on newly filed charges of sex trafficking of minors. A medical examiner ruled his death a suicide by hanging.
For decades, Epstein nurtured a reputation as a “science philanthropist" and gathered a coterie of biologists, mathematicians, physicists, and artificial intelligence researchers around him. He feted them on his private island and in his lavish homes, and funded their research.
The scientists were among the most prominent people in their fields and included professors at Harvard and MIT.
The decisions of MIT faculty regarding monetary gifts are “always subject to longstanding Institute processes and principles," according to Reif's letter.
“To my great regret despite following the processes that have served MIT well for many years, in this instance we have made a mistake of judgment," he said.
Reif indicated that all of the monetary gifts from Epstein occurred over the span of about 20 years and went either to the MIT Media Lab or mechanical engineering professor Seth Lloyd.
Last week, Joi Ito, the media lab's director, apologized for his connections to Epstein and on Thursday, Lloyd also apologized.
In a post on Medium, Lloyd said he met Epstein at a dinner for scientists and their supporters in 2004 and discussed scientific questions during Epstein's visits to Harvard University “over the next few years." Epstein's foundation, he said, gave him a grant to support his research.
Earlier this summer, federal prosecutors charged Epstein, 66, with sexually abusing dozens of girls between 2002 and 2005. The indictment renewed attention on how Epstein had escaped severe punishment in an investigation of sexual abuse more than a decade ago in Florida.
Epstein had avoided federal criminal charges in 2008 after prosecutors brokered a widely criticized deal that allowed him to plead guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor and serve 13 months in jail.
Lloyd, the MIT professor, said he visited Epstein during his prison term in Florida and that after his release, he resumed attending discussions Epstein convened with other scientists and accepted two grants from his foundation, one in 2012 and another in 2017.
“These were professional as well as moral failings," Lloyd said in his apology. “The job of a scientist is to look for the truth, and the job of a teacher is to help people to empower themselves. I failed to do my job on both counts."
Ito, the MIT Media Lab director, has acknowledged that he had invited Epstein to the Media Lab, traveled to the financier's homes, and accepted money from him for the research center and Ito's own investments after Epstein's conviction.
Last week, Ito said he met Epstein in 2013 through a trusted business friend.
The media lab is known for developing robotic prosthetics to mimic the human gait and launching the online news giant Buzzfeed, among other initiatives.
Amid the fallout from the lab's connections to Epstein, two researchers have cut ties with the research center. J. Nathan Matias, a visiting scholar at the lab, said in a Wednesday statement that he was “profoundly disappointed in the decisions that Joi made, and that the Lab somehow allowed to happen."
That statement came after Ethan Zuckerman, director of the lab's Center for Civic Media, told MIT officials of his plans to resign in protest over the lab's ties to Epstein.
“I am ashamed of my institution today and starting the hard work of figuring out how to leave the Lab while taking care of my students and staff," Zuckerman wrote in a note that was obtained by the Globe.
Reif said members of the MIT community were struggling with the fact some researchers had accepted money from Epstein.
“Because the accusations against Jeffrey Epstein are so shocking, it can be difficult to maintain a fair understanding about what individuals at MIT could have been expected to know at the time, but I hope we can offer these members of our community the reassurance of our compassionate understanding," Reif said.
Thursday night, BethAnn McLaughlin, the founder of the nonprofit MeTooSTEM, said MIT still needs to address the culture that allowed the relationships with Epstein to develop.
McLaughlin, who won last year's Disobedience Award from the Media Lab for her work on sexual harassment in science, said her organization plans to come to MIT in the coming weeks to talk to those affected by such issues.
“I don't see anyone fired," McLaughlin said. “I see them saying 'we have a system in place.' They have a failed system."

Texto completo: “Facts are stubborn things.” That quote is often attributed to Founding Father John Adams, and he did say it, but didn’t originate it, according to quoteinvestigator.com.
President Donald Trump disagrees. He clearly believes he can make facts play his tune, and get his base supporters to dance to it. He lies constantly and disregards inconvenient truths, especially any facts that make him look bad and most especially facts that might reflect well on his despised predecessor, Barack Obama.
Journalists are wedded to the importance of factual accuracy in a way that a compulsive liar/braggart like Trump either cannot imagine or thinks is for suckers. Dishonesty ranks high among the Trumpian traits that bother me, and the fact that his supporters either don’t know they are being lied to or don’t care is very hard for me to accept. But there it is.
The fact-checkers, whose work is more and more important for those who prefer facts over lies, police the line between fact and falsehood on a day-to-day basis, and do a great job. Today, my small contribution is to pass along a very good overview that reflects on one of Trump’s favorite overarching falsehoods. Namely:
‘Obama bad; Trump good’ is pretty much his analysis
Trump describes an America in which everything was going down the tubes under Obama, which is why we needed Trump to make America great again. And he claims that this project has come to fruition, with America setting records for prosperity under his leadership and guidance. “Obama bad; Trump good” is pretty much his analysis in all areas and measurement of U.S. activity, especially economically. Even if this were true, it would reflect poorly on Trump’s character, but it has the added problem of being false, a big lie made up of many small ones.
Personally, I don’t assume that all economic measurements directly reflect the leadership of whoever occupies the Oval Office, nor am I smart enough to figure out what causes what in the economy. But the idea that presidents get the credit or the blame for the economy during their tenure is a political fact of life. Trump, in his adorable, immodest mendacity, not only claims credit for everything good that happens in the economy, but tells people, literally and specifically, that they have to vote for him even if they hate him, because without his guidance, their 401(k) accounts “will go down the tubes.” That would be offensive even if it were true, but it is utterly false. The stock market has been on a 10-year run of steady gains that began in 2009, the year Barack Obama was inaugurated. But why would anyone care about that? It’s only an unarguable, stubborn fact.
Still, speaking of facts, there are so many measurements and indicators of how the economy is doing, that those not committed to an honest investigation can find evidence for whatever they want to believe. Trump and his most committed followers want to believe that everything was terrible under Barack Obama and great under Trump.
The data
That’s baloney. Anyone who believes that believes something false. And a series of charts and graphs published Monday in the Washington Post and explained by Economics Correspondent Heather Long provides the data that tells the tale. The details are complicated. Click through to the link above and you’ll learn much. But the overview is pretty simply this:
The U.S. economy had a major meltdown in the last year of the George W. Bush presidency. Again, I’m not smart enough to know how much of this was Bush’s “fault.” But he had been in office for six years when the trouble started. So, if it’s ever reasonable to hold a president accountable for the performance of the economy, the timeline is bad for Bush. GDP growth went negative. Job growth fell sharply and then went negative. Median household income shrank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by more than 5,000 points! U.S. manufacturing output plunged, as did average home values, as did average hourly wages, as did measures of consumer confidence and most other indicators of economic health.
(Backup for that is contained in the Post piece I linked to above.)
Barack Obama inherited that mess of falling numbers, which continued during his first year in office, 2009, as he put in place policies designed to turn it around. By 2010, Obama’s second year, pretty much all of the negative numbers had turned positive. By the time Obama was up for reelection in 2012, all of them were headed in the right direction, which is certainly among the reasons voters gave him a second term by a solid (not landslide) margin.
Continued through second term
Basically, all of those good numbers continued throughout the second Obama term. The U.S. GDP, probably the single best measure of how the economy is doing, grew by 2.9 percent in 2015, which was Obama’s seventh year in office and was the best GDP growth number since before the crash of the late Bush years. GDP growth slowed to 1.6 percent in 2016, which may have been among the indicators that supported Trump’s campaign-year argument that everything was going to hell and only he could fix it.
During the first year of Trump, GDP growth grew to 2.4 percent, which is decent but not great and anyway, a reasonable person would acknowledge that — to the degree that economic performance is to the credit or blame of the president — the performance in the first year of a new president is a mixture of the old and new policies.
In Trump’s second year, 2018, the GDP grew 2.9 percent, equaling Obama’s best year, and so far in 2019, the growth rate has fallen to 2.1 percent, a mediocre number and a decline for which Trump presumably accepts no responsibility and blames either Nancy Pelosi, Ilhan Omar or, if he can swing it, Barack Obama.
I suppose it’s natural for a president to want to take credit for everything good that happens on his (or someday her) watch, but not the blame for anything bad. Trump is more blatant about this than most. If we judge by his bad but remarkably steady approval ratings (today, according to the average maintained by 538.com, it’s 41.9 approval/ 53.7 disapproval) the pretty-good economy is not winning him new supporters, nor is his constant exaggeration of his accomplishments costing him many old ones).
I already offered it above, but the full Washington Post workup of these numbers, and commentary/explanation by economics correspondent Heather Long, are here.
About that deficit
On a related matter, if you care about what used to be called fiscal conservatism, which is the belief that federal debt and deficit matter, here’s a New York Times analysis, based on Congressional Budget Office data, suggesting that the annual budget deficit (that’s the amount the government borrows every year reflecting that amount by which federal spending exceeds revenues) which fell steadily during the Obama years, from a peak of $1.4 trillion at the beginning of the Obama administration, to $585 billion in 2016 (Obama’s last year in office), will be back up to $960 billion this fiscal year, and back over $1 trillion in 2020. (Here’s the New York Times piece detailing those numbers.)
Trump is currently floating various tax cuts for the rich and the poor that will presumably worsen those projections, if passed. As the Times piece reported:
Rising deficit projections are the result of sluggish growth in federal revenue after Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts went into effect, and several bipartisan agreements to raise military and nondefense domestic discretionary spending, which Mr. Trump signed into law… Typically, the budget deficit shrinks when unemployment is low. Mr. Trump’s administration has defied that trend.
I do wonder how much Trump’s supporters, who presumably consider themselves “conservatives,” including “fiscal conservatives,” know about these trends, and how much they care.

Congress must respond to Trump on foster care

Texto completo: About 2,000 Iowa children were in family foster care in fiscal year 2018. This state has only about 2,300 foster families to provide safe places for these children while their parents address problems. The kids who cannot return home need forever families.
That means Iowa needs more foster and adoptive parents.
Unfortunately, the Trump administration is not helping attract them. Just the opposite. It is sending a message that only certain families are welcome to help vulnerable children.
In January, the administration granted special permission to a federally funded child welfare agency in South Carolina to deny foster and adoptive parents based on their religious beliefs. Miracle Hill, an evangelical Protestant provider, is allowed to turn away families and mentors who do not share its views.
Those views are reflected in its doctrinal statement, which dismisses the existence of gay marriage and transgender people.
"God's design for marriage is the legal joining of one man and one woman in a lifelong covenant relationship," according to the doctrine. "God creates each person as either male or female, and these two, distinct, complementary sexes, together reflect the image and nature of God."
Until this summer, Miracle Hill would not even work with Catholic families. After much negative attention, it decided to do so "for the sake of unity among followers of Jesus Christ."
But non-Christian, gay, Muslim, agnostic and many other families need not apply to the state's largest foster care organization for children who don't have significant special needs. And what if you're a foster child who identifies with another gender?
Last year the Greenville News reported on Beth Lesser and her husband, who had been foster parents for a decade in Florida before moving to South Carolina. They contacted a local group for assistance in getting approved to mentor kids, went through training and completed background checks. An employee of Miracle Hill was among the trainers.
Lesser said Protestant Christians were given an application to work with the agency and others were given the option of working with the state, which has a smaller pool of children. Lesser said she was told by Miracle Hill staff she wasn't selected because she didn't share the organization's Christian beliefs. She is Jewish.
Yet the Trump administration seems to believe it's OK for taxpayer dollars to fund agencies advancing a discriminatory political agenda under the guise of "religious liberty."
In a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Lambda Legal pointed out what should have been obvious: Exempting federally funded organizations that discriminate violates numerous constitutional and legal protections.
It harms not only prospective foster parents, but can deprive children of their rights to freedom of speech, religion and equal treatment.
"Additionally, children of minority faiths could be compelled to participate in religious activities different from their own, in violation of their constitutional rights and prohibitions against proselytization in federal law," wrote Lambda.
The Trump administration hasn't budged.
News organizations, including the New York Times, recently reported administration officials are considering either rolling back the Obama-era nondiscrimination policy that prohibits adoption agencies from shutting out same-sex couples or adding an exemption for religious groups.
Translation: Child welfare agencies would no longer need special permission to shun qualified families. National policy would allow it.
Congress must intervene.
Earlier this year Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand introduced the Every Child Deserves a Family Act. Members of the U.S. House also introduced a bipartisan bill to prohibit federally funded adoption, foster care and child welfare agencies from discriminating against children or families on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, religion or marital status.
Iowa's congressional delegation, particularly Sen. Charles Grassley, who has prided himself on advocating for foster kids, should support this legislation.
Iowa and other states need more loving, stable families to help the more than 400,000 children in this country's child welfare system.
All kinds of families should be welcomed.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump promised he’d get rid of bad rules.
“Remove the anchor dragging us down!” he said when campaigning for president. “We’re going to cancel every needless job-killing regulation!”
Trump was a developer, so he knew that the thicket of rules government imposes often makes it impossible to get things done.
But would he keep his deregulation promise? I was skeptical.
Republicans often talk deregulation but then add rules. People called President George W. Bush an “anti-regulator.” But once he was president, he hired 90,000 new regulators!
Trump has been different.
When he took office, he hired regulation skeptics. He told government agencies: Get rid of two regulations for every new one you add.
I think his anti-regulation attitude is why stock prices rose and unemployment dropped. Trump sent a message to business: Government will no longer try to crush you. Businesses then started hiring.
Of course, the media wasn’t happy. Reporters love regulation.
They call Trump’s moves “an attack on the environment” and on “workers’ health.” The New York Times ran the headline “Donald Trump Is Trying to Kill You!”
What the media don’t get is that regulations have unintended side effects that often outweigh the good they’re intended to do.
Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Cars built smaller to comply with President Obama’s rules that require doubling of gas mileage cause increased deaths because smaller cars provide less protection.
“Should the government tell you what kind of car to buy?” asks Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform in my new video about Trump.
Norquist says that Trump has largely kept his deregulation promise, and that’s been great for America.
For example, Trump repealed the Obama-era plan to classify franchise businesses like McDonald’s as one single business. Why?
“The trial lawyers want to be able to sue all of McDonald’s, not just the local McDonald’s, if they spill coffee on themselves,” says Norquist. “And the labor unions want to unionize all McDonald’s, not just the one store. That would have been a disaster.”
Trump’s FCC repealed Obama’s “net neutrality” rule, which would have limited internet providers’ freedom to charge different prices.
Democrats and other regulation-lovers predicted repeal would mean that rich people would dominate the internet. Bernie Sanders even tweeted that repeal would mean “the end of the internet as we know it.”
Of course, none of those things happened. Or as Norquist puts it: “None of it! None of it!”
But some Obama regulations sounded so important.
Norquist laughs at that. “The names for these regulations are written by regulators. They’re advertisements for themselves.”
Of course, unlike advertisers, regulators don’t list side effects of their rules, which Norquist says should read: “May cause unemployment, may reduce wages, may raise the cost of energy, may make your car not drivable.”
Trump’s deregulation record would be better were he not so eager to add regulations, such as tariffs, at the same time.
“There is a challenge. Trump is a protectionist in many ways,” says Norquist, sadly. “Tariffs are taxes, and regulations on the border are regulations on consumers.”
So are Trump’s “buy American” rules.
“That sounds like a good idea, but it’s a dumb idea, and I wish he hadn’t done it,” says Norquist. “That is not deregulation. The good news is that the vast majority of the acts have been deregulatory and tremendously helpful.”
Recently, Trump announced, “We have cut 22 regulations for every new regulation!”
He exaggerated, as he often does. The real number is about five. But that’s still pretty good. Better than Ronald Reagan did.
I wish Trump would do more.
I wish he’d remove his tariffs and agricultural subsidies and kill the Export-Import Bank, drug prohibition and the onerous rules that encourage illegal immigration by making it almost impossible for foreigners to work here legally.
Keep your promise, President Trump! Repeal 22 regulations for every new one!
Nevertheless, so far, mostly good.
Every excessive rule repealed is a step in the right direction: toward freedom.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump said Wednesday in Louisville that while he and leaders in Washington are working on gun control, people have to remember that "the gun doesn't pull the trigger. "
"It’s the person that pulls the trigger," Trump told a WDRB-TV reporter before speaking to attendees of an AMVETS conference. "And we have a tremendous mental health problem, and we’re going to be working on that as well. "
The comments came a few hours after Trump reversed himself on firearms restrictions, saying in Washington, D. C. , that he supports background checks after saying a day earlier he didn't want to go down the "slippery slope" of eroding gun owners' rights.
Speaking from the White House South Lawn as he prepared to depart for Louisville, Trump confirmed that he discussed background checks with Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle Association, but he disputed news reports that he told LaPierre that background checks were off the table.
“I have an appetite for background checks,” Trump said. “We’re going to be doing background checks. . . . We’re going to be filling in some of the loopholes. ”
In Louisville, he said gun owners would be protected.
"Well, we're doing background checks," he said. "We already have a lot of background checks. You know, we’ve done the FixNICS program and a lot of other things, but we’re doing some loopholes and we’re doing some changes and I think it’s going to be quite good. "

The president said he was working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is recuperating from a broken shoulder in Louisville, to get "something done that's meaningful but that really protects gun owners because that's very important. "
He said the Second Amendment would be protected.
In Washington, Trump said he wants to get guns out of the hands of the mentally unstable and said he considers mass shootings a public emergency.
“I want guns to be in the hands of people who are mentally stable,” he said.
Tuesday, Trump backed away from supporting stricter gun measures, saying laws were already "very strong. "
"We have very strong background checks right now," he said.
Tuesday, Trump spoke on the phone with the NRA's LaPierre.
The Atlantic first reported the details of the phone call, followed by The Washington Post and The New York Times.
According to the outlets, Trump told LaPierre that comprehensive background checks for firearm purchases were no longer under consideration and that the White House would advocate for other measures concerning mental health or the prosecution of federal gun crimes.

The NRA confirmed that a call took place, posting a message Tuesday on Twitter from LaPierre that he spoke to the president.
"We discussed the best ways to prevent these types of tragedies. @realDonaldTrump is a strong #2A President and supports our Right to Keep and Bear Arms," LaPierre wrote through the official NRA account.
The NRA has vehemently opposed the imposition of stricter background checks for firearm purchases, but strife at the organization gave gun control advocates hope that stricter measures could be passed.

Texto completo: Give our most vulnerable kids more books
Bookkids needs help. Our goal is to give Santa Fe's most vulnerable children books of their own. Just this spring and summer, Bookkids has given over 5,700 books to children in four elementary schools in which all of the children in the schools are on free lunch and most are reading below grade level.
Now through Friday, Bookkids is in the running for a grant from State Farm insurance for $25,000. We could buy so many books with that money. We are all volunteers, and are a 501(c)(3) organization. The grants will be given to the 40 agencies across the nation with the most votes. You can vote each day. Friends and family from all over may vote for our project. Bookkids is the only program in New Mexico in the running for this money. Please vote for us at www.neighborhoodassist.com/entry/2023540
We could do so much more to strengthen our children's reading skills and give them the gift of literacy. For more information about Bookkids, go to www.bookkidssantafe.com

Create jobs
Think New Mexico, a results-oriented think tank serving New Mexicans, has previously informed the state Legislature of Utah's successful model of using postperformance tax incentives to create new jobs.
Unlike most of New Mexico's current economic development incentives, which reward some companies before they actually create jobs, a postperformance incentive is awarded only after a company delivers new jobs and new tax revenues. A postperformance incentive might rebate up to 30 percent of a company's state taxes for 5-10 years for out-of-state businesses that relocate to New Mexico and in-state businesses that expand operations and create new jobs.
There would be no risk to taxpayers. This tax incentive would pay for itself, as the rebate is less than one third of the new taxes paid by the businesses. These postperformance incentives would help create the jobs we need for the next generation of New Mexicans.

Produce rules
The lead story recently in many leading newspapers ("Climate change threatens world food supply," New York Times, Aug. 8) was prompted by the release of a summary report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, staffed by more than 100 experts from 52 countries.
The report details how climate change is threatening our world's food and water supplies -- turning arable land to desert, degrading soil, and raising the frequency of devastating weather conditions.
In an environmentally sustainable world, meat and dairy products in our diet must be replaced by vegetables, fruits, and grains, just as fossil fuels are replaced by wind, solar, and other pollution-free energy sources. Our next visit to the supermarket provides a superb starting point.

Also not impressed
John Block's overwhelming embrace of the megalomaniac, narcissistic, cruel, pathological liar of a president and his so-called "accomplishments" must be a joke ("Not impressed," Letters to the editor, Aug. 18). What accomplishments?
Block claims Donald Trump won election by "epic proportions." Nonsense. He claims Trump delivered "the best economy in generations," which began under President Barack Obama and did not go south until "Tariff Man" levied his unnecessary tax on China, starting a global economic downturn that could mean another recession.
The "decimation of ISIS" started with the killing of al-Qaida's Osama bin Laden under Obama. Trump's "tax reform" gave billions of dollars to the 1 percent and corporations under the lie that it would mean lots of business expansion and jobs. His "diplomacy with North Korea" has made a fool of the United States. And the "confirming constitutionalist judges" stacked the courts with right-wing justices.

Not the time
Donald Trump has done many dastardly things, but impeachment is not the answer. While it might pass the House, there are not enough votes in the Senate to convict, so it would die there. Trump would see this as a victory, crow about it in campaign speeches to his base, and it could change the election in his favor. This must not happen. Please tell your senators and representatives that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is right. This is not the time for impeachment.

Harry Reid knocks 2020 field on immigration, healthcare

Texto completo: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says the far-left positions of some Democratic presidential candidates are jeopardizing the party's chances of beating President Trump in 2020.
The longtime elected official from Nevada, in a Vice News interview, specifically blasted proposals to provide "Medicare for all" and to decriminalize illegal crossings from Mexico into the U.S.
Reid served as Senate majority leader from 2007-2015 and minority leader for two years before and after. He spent 30 years in the Senate after stints in the House, the Nevada Gaming Commission, Nevada lieutenant governor, and state assemblyman. Known as a wily legislative tactician, the blunt-spoken Reid said the "Medicare for all" proposal, a favorite of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, isn't politically realistic.
"How are you going to get it passed?" Reid, 79, said rhetorically.
“I think that we should focus on improving Obamacare. We can do that — without bringing something that would be much harder to sell,” Reid said. “Improving Obamacare: People understand that. They would appreciate that. It locks in many important things.”
Reid also called for a more moderate approach to countering illegal immigration, implicitly criticizing the border decriminalization approach advocated by 2020 Democrat Julián Castro, a former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary.
“There are so many more important things to do. Decriminalizing border crossings is not something that should be at the top of the list. It should be way, way down at the bottom of the list,” he said. “People want a fair immigration system. They don’t want an open-door invitation for everybody to come at once."
Reid has been at odds with some 2020 Democrats on other issues, including ending the filibuster in the Senate, which effectively requires 60 votes to get anything passed. Earlier this month, Reid authored an op-ed in the New York Times arguing for an elimination of the filibuster. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has expressed deep reservations about ditching the filibuster, saying it preserves minority party rights in the chamber.
“The filibuster is just no longer useful. The Senate does nothing anymore. No one offers amendments; they can’t, [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell won’t let them. All they do is vote on judges, that’s all they do,” Reid wrote. “I think it would be better if the Senate have majority rule. Where did we ever come up with 60 being the magical number?

With A Little Human Help, Wild Pups Romp Again In An African Paradise

Texto completo: Last summer, not long after releasing a pioneer pack of 14 African wild dogs into Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park as part of an ambitious wildlife restoration effort, Paola Bouley went to see for herself what in the name of Canis major could have happened to the wild dog pups.
As Gorongosa’s carnivore expert, Bouley knew that Beira, the alpha female of the pack, had been pregnant when the dogs were set free. She knew that the closely bonded and highly endangered apex predators had dug a maternity den for their queen, and that Beira had spent a lot of time down there - until one day, she didn’t. She and the pack had moved on.
But where were the pups?
As Bouley was crouching by the abandoned den and peering into the hole, she met the likely answer. A giant African rock python - the continent’s largest species of snake, which can grow to 20 feet and swallow an impala whole - dropped from a nearby tree, stared her in the face and then slithered off.
“I think it was disappointed that I wasn’t a warthog,” Bouley said.
Yet the wild dogs were unbowed, and this year, after migrating to a less serpent-y sector of Gorongosa’s 1 million acres, they made up for lost time in spectacular fashion. Beira give birth in late April to 11 pups, who emerged from their den in early June and appear on camera trap footage to be thriving, as well as inexcusably cute (although the runt of the litter eventually died).
Of greater surprise to Bouley and her colleagues, Nhamagaia, the beta female of the pack, defied the L. pictus convention that only the resident alpha female gets to breed, and in late June delivered her own litter of eight.
The researchers initially feared that Beira and the other adult dogs might reject the off-label young, leaving them to die of neglect. But no: The new pups have been swept up into the sens-a-round frenzy of carnivore kumbaya - life as an ardently, obligately social mammal for whom, as wild dog expert Scott Creel of Montana State University put it, “the worst thing that can happen is to be alone.”
Gorongosa’s pup eruption didn’t end there. Not far from the Beira-Nhamagaia creche, a group of four adult dogs that had split off from the original pack in the spring - three males and one female - appeared to be successfully rearing yet another litter of eight pups.
“It’s incredibly exciting,” said Cole du Plessis, coordinator of the wild dog range expansion program at the Endangered Wildlife Trust. “At the beginning of last year there were no wild dogs in Gorongosa, and now we’re closing in on 50.”
And why not? “When I flew over Gorongosa,” du Plessis said, “looking at the prey numbers, the water, the topography - I thought, if you could sketch what wild dog heaven would look like, Gorongosa is it.”
The successful reintroduction into Gorongosa of African wild dogs underscores the park’s position as one of the bright spots on an otherwise grim landscape of shrinking forests and accelerating loss of large, charismatic animals unlucky enough to not be our pets or livestock.
During Mozambique’s civil war, which ended in the mid-1990s, Gorongosa’s abundant wildlife was almost destroyed. Since then, the park has been steadily recovering, aided by an unusual partnership between the Mozambique government and the wealthy American philanthropist Gregory Carr, along with input from local communities, international teams of scientists, conservationists, human rights advocates - really, anybody Carr can get on the phone.
Researchers see in Gorongosa the chance to track the recovery of a complex ecosystem from the ground up, and to see what will heal on its own and what requires intervention.
Getting the right mix of grazers and meat-eaters has proved a particular challenge.
Herbivores were the first to bounce back in post-conflict Gorongosa, and today the park pulses with more than 100,000 of them: blue wildebeest, buffalo, impala, hippo, waterbuck, reedbuck, elephant, eland, nyala, oribi, the hauntingly beautiful sable, the disturbingly furry bushpig.
Experts thought that, with so much meat on the hoof, carnivores of all stripes would surely immigrate from surrounding areas of their own accord, but predator rebound has proved spotty - or not spotty enough.
The lions in the park have fared well, and from the handful that remained after the war, the number today is 146 and rising. “We’ve got cubs everywhere,” Bouley said. “It’s hard keeping up with them.”
Not so for the other major predators. Spotted hyenas, which are common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and once were a Gorongosa staple, have yet to return, and the park team hopes to reintroduce a clan or two in the next few years. So, too, the leopards: Camera traps have picked up a lone leopard, probably a male, skulking around at night, but for all the park’s abundance of a leopard’s favorite dish, baboon, that loner has remained a party of one.
“We’re pushing to translocate some females from outlying areas into the core of the park,” Bouley said. “That should draw in other males and jump-start the leopard population.”
In the meantime, the wild dogs are having their day, hunting ferociously and cooperatively every morning and afternoon and sometimes in between.
Wild dogs, which are also known as painted wolves, are not like other dogs. According to a recent genomic analysis, they split off from the rest of the canid lineage some 1.7 million years ago. They twitter and sneeze rather than bark or howl, and their ears are like satellite dishes to track prey and one another’s high-pitched calls. Their legs are like the sticks of a shadow puppet, and they have four toes rather than five, an adaptation that helps them run at up to 45 mph.
In Gorongosa, the dogs target bushbuck, impala and waterbuck, surrounding the prey, grabbing at legs, nose and hindquarters, disemboweling it from below. Whatever they do, they do as a team. A lion may stray from its pride for hours or even days at a time, but wild dogs are never out of sight, smell and sound of their pack mates.
Creel, who has studied dog packs in Zambia and Tanzania, said, “If you don’t see an individual for an hour, you know the dog has either died or dispersed” - gone off to join a new pack.
Group life has its privileges, including being cared for when sick or injured. Last year Nhamagaia, the beta female, broke a front leg. “You could see it dangling,” Bouley said. “We thought we were going to lose her.”
But though the dog straggled behind, the pack would wait patiently for her and make sure she could feed at a kill, and the leg eventually healed.
The dogs are cooperative hunters and cooperative breeders, a fairly rare reproductive strategy among mammals. In this system, the alpha pair of the pack do most of the breeding, while the other adults serve as childless helpers at the nest. They regurgitate meat from a kill to feed the lactating alpha female, and they regurgitate still more to fuel her weaned but dependent, ever-begging pups.
The alpha dogs defend their status through minor acts of aggression, nips and charges, particularly during mating season, but the subordinates don’t seem to mind. Creel and his colleagues found that underdogs have lower levels of stress hormones, compared to the dominant pair.
Subordinate females generally don’t bother to ovulate, and their balance of sex hormones resembles that of women on birth control pills. It’s a tough enough job to keep the alpha female’s litter alive, especially in brutally competitive settings where the dogs are surrounded by lions and hyenas eager to steal their prey and kill their young, and where the ranges of other dog packs encroach on theirs.
Moreover, because subordinate pack members often are related to the dominant dogs, helping the pups keeps some fraction of their genetic legacy alive.
Nevertheless, subordinates may seek higher status and personal parenthood in a number of ways: by dispersing to a neighboring pack if available, forming a new pack, or getting pregnant at home and hoping for the best.
Bouley suspects that Gorongosa’s lavish conditions, of abundant prey and light competition, explain the success of Nhamagaia’s insubordinate act. The alpha female not only didn’t shun the beta’s young - with her own pups mostly weaned, Beira pitched in as wet nurse to the new brood. The older pups treat their juniors like toys, one taking the head, the other the tail, in a tug of war.

Texto completo: Uber Technologies has signed a 10-year lease for a massive amount of office space at the old main post office, giving it room for thousands of employees.
Uber on Monday confirmed it will occupy 463,000 square feet, becoming the building's largest tenant. The Tribune reported in May that the California-based technology company was negotiating a move to the post office site.
The deal is the largest office lease signed in downtown Chicago this year and one of the largest in Chicago in recent years. Not including renewals or extensions of existing office spaces, Uber's deal is the fourth-largest in the past five years, according to CBRE.
Uber is set to start construction on its new space in the old post office next spring. It is unclear how many employees will ultimately work there.
"Uber is excited to deepen its roots in Chicago," company spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said in a statement. "The city continues to attract the top talent that Uber needs to continue to thrive, and we remain committed to working together to have a positive impact in the local community."
The company's finalized deal gives developer 601W Cos. an anchor for its ongoing $800 million-plus redevelopment of the 2.8 million-square-foot former post office at 433 W. Van Buren St. on the Chicago River.
Uber's lease is more than double the next largest space. Deerfield-based Walgreens in June 2018 announced plans to lease 200,000 square feet, saying it planned to move 1,800 suburban and downtown workers into the space.
Other signed tenants include Ferrara Candy, Home Chef, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and ad firm AbelsonTaylor. The first tenants will start moving in this fall.
More than 1 million square feet of leases have been completed. New York-based 601W also is close to completing deals with CBOE Global Markets and Cisco Systems for about 300,000 square feet combined.
Uber's Chicago office was already its second-largest outside of its San Francisco headquarters. Chicago is home to Uber Freight, the company's fastest-growing business unit.
The Tribune reported in March that the company planned to hire hundreds of employees throughout the year for its freight unit, which connects truck drivers with shippers. Uber told the Tribune then that the company employed more than 1,000 people in Chicago.
Uber was looking for space where it could consolidate its Uber Freight workers in the city with others it employs for its Uber Ride and Uber Eats business.
Currently, Uber Freight's headquarters are at 225 W. Randolph St. Other Uber businesses are at 111 N. Canal St. Combined, that's about 185,000 square feet of Chicago office space.
Uber's expansion in Chicago has been rapid, starting with a 12,000-square-foot space in Fulton Market just five years ago.
But the company has faced some hitches. It went public in May but is unprofitable, and it has faced questions about whether it can turn a profit. Last month, The New York Times reported that Uber laid off about one-third of its marketing team from offices around the world.
An Uber representative confirmed that 400 employees had been laid off, but declined to say which offices were affected. Uber shares were trading below $36 a share Monday morning, down from its initial public offering price of $45.
Uber was represented in the lease by CBRE brokers Paul Reaumond and Ian Murphy. The landlord was represented by brokers Steve Smith, Dan Heckman and Jamey Dix of the Telos Group.
Late last year, there were two new, approximately 500,000-square-foot leases to anchor new office buildings in downtown Chicago: San Francisco-based Salesforce's deal for the last of three planned towers on the Wolf Point site on the Chicago River, and Toronto-based BMO Financial Group's commitment to a tower adjacent to Union Station.
In 2017, Bank of America signed a nearly 500,000-square-foot lease to anchor an office skyscraper now under construction on the river at 110 N. Wacker Drive.

I've treated inmates like Jeffrey Epstein

Texto completo: As a physician who has worked with prisoners as well as suicidal patients, I was shocked by the strange circumstances surrounding sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein's death by hanging in his cell. We might never know for sure all the details of what happened, though the New York City chief medical examiner has officially ruled that this was a suicide.
Earlier in my career, I worked on both a psychiatric ward and a prison ward. In both places, the regular surveillance was sufficient (at least every 15 minutes on the psych ward) so that suicide was almost impossible. For someone who, like Epstein, had apparently made a suicide attempt less than three weeks before, it is almost inconceivable to me that he could possibly be without diligent, frequent observation and without surveillance cameras constantly monitoring him.
How could he be placed in a cell, according to the New York Post's unnamed source, with a bunk bed to hang himself on and a strong enough bed sheet to do it with?
If one cellmate was transferred, as sources told The New York Times, why wasn't he immediately replaced with another?
It's true that suicide is the leading cause of death in jails and, in 2014, hit a 15-year high in federal and state prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. But although accused sexual offenders are particularly at risk for both suicides and homicides, the Metropolitan Correctional Center where Epstein was imprisoned has had only one reported suicide over the past 40years, the gangster Louis Turra, 21years ago.
Despite its reputation for squalor and overcrowding, the corrections center is not known for suicide.
What is most disturbing to me, as a physician, is the way Epstein went from being on suicide watch starting July 23 to going for long periods without being observed just six days later, according to The Times account.
Having treated depression for many years, I know suicidal ideation doesn't turn on and off like a switch. A person does not want to end it all one day -- staring down news as bleak as Epstein faced -- and then six days later you are suddenly stable and out of danger.
Whoever took Epstein off this watch made a very poor judgment at the very least. On top of that there is The Times report, citing the Federal Bureau of Prisons and law enforcement officials, that guards fell asleep for possibly hours while on watch and then falsified records. That is simply inexcusable.
Attorney General William Barr last week cited "serious irregularities" at the prison and, on Monday, he removed the acting director of the Bureau of Prisons, Hugh Hurwitz. That was the right thing to do.
No matter what happened inside Epstein's cell, both the medical personnel and the prison authorities who were involved had the obligation to bring him to a safer place, whether that meant more enhanced psychiatric observation inside the prison, or transferring him with enhanced security to an inpatient psychiatric facility. There was plenty of warning that this could happen to him.
After all, we don't judge our patients, no matter how repulsive their actions or the allegations against them are. Doctors and nurses are simply assigned to try to keep them alive.
I have taken care of a perpetrator of assault chained to a stretcher in the emergency room right next to his victim suffering from a gunshot wound, and I have had to do my best to save both without hesitation.
The prison officials who took Jeffrey Epstein off his suicide watch prematurely, relegating him to almost certain death, did not do the prison system and how it handles mental health emergencies any favors.

Trump's claim of an economic plot against America betrays a whiff of desperation Trump's claim of an economic plot against America betrays a whiff of desperation

Texto completo: “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function." So wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald.
“This philosophy fitted on to my early adult life," he added, “when I saw the improbable, the implausible, often the 'impossible,' come true."
It also fits on President Trump, though, for the moment, let's limit the “first-rate" label to his political instincts.
How else to explain a pair of Trump tweets on Monday that declared “Our Economy is very strong" and called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a full percentage point.
A reduction that drastic would be warranted only if the economy were collapsing, as it was at the end of 2008. With the country in the full throes of the financial crisis in December of that year, the Fed slashed rates from 1 percent to a range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
With a growth rate this year of about 2 percent, the economy isn't “very strong," but it remains in good shape. So good that many economists — and two voting members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee — believe that the Fed's quarter-point rate cut last month was unnecessary.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell justified the move as a kind of insurance policy against the impact on the United States of slowdowns in China and Europe, and the president's tariff-happy trade strategy.
Trump's incessant jawboning for lower rates and criticism of Powell — on Monday, he decried “the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed" — is the president's own insurance against a recession hitting before the 2020 elections. While there is zero chance the Fed lowers rates by a percentage point “over a short period of time," as called for by Trump, the Fed is truly worried about the fallout from Trump's trade war.
Investors put the odds at more than 90 percent in favor of a quarter-point move at the Fed's next meeting, on Sept. 17-18. That's a reduction of a half percentage point this year that may not have ever happened if Trump hadn't gone after the Fed.
Like I said, first-rate political strategy.
But there's more.
At this stage in the 2020 campaign, Trump is no doubt confident he can beat any of the candidates leading the Democratic pack. If the economy and financial markets don't go south.
In a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists, 38 percent of respondents said they expected a downturn in 2020, down from 42 percent in the group's survey in February.
Also on Monday, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and one of the dissenters in last month's rate-cut vote, told Bloomberg TV that policy makers have “plenty of things to be worried about." But he expects a resilient American consumer will continue to drive the economy forward.
All that is decent news for the president, but he's not taking any chances. Betraying a whiff of desperation, several senior White House officials are considering whether to push for a temporary payroll tax cut as a way to buttress the economy, The Washington Post reported Monday. And Trump has recently begun talking about a conspiracy to croak the economy as a way to defeat him.
It's not just Powell and the Fed that he's implicating in this Plot Against America. “He has said other countries, including allies, are working to hurt American economic interests," New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wrote over the weekend. “And he has accused the news media of trying to create a recession."
If the economy does sour before the election, it won't be the president's fault. His campaign rallies will be one long tirade against colluding immigrants, Muslims, socialists, gun haters, the fake news media, and . . . the Fed! Only he'll be able to save us.
“You have no choice but to vote for me because your 401(k), everything is going to be down the tubes. So whether you love me or hate me, you've got to vote for me," he told a crowd in New Hampshire last week.
“Show me a hero," Fitzgerald said, “and I'll write you a tragedy."

Texto completo: A few years ago, I took a call at the nature center about a big snake in Tekakwitha Woods Forest Preserve. The caller was pretty rattled, and she wanted someone to "do something."
We naturalists are pretty used to snake calls. I calmly suggested, "It could be a fox snake. Not at all dangerous." As I began to launch into the benefits of native snakes, she interrupted. "No! It’s really big!"
One of our rangers had received a similar call and was already out looking for the suspect serpent. He spotted some kids clustered around a tree with mouths agape and easily homed in on the problem.
There, coiled on a branch, was a REALLY big snake. It was a four-foot ball python. The source of the exotic reptile could only be a pet owner who didn’t want it anymore.
Castoff critters are a local and a worldwide ecological problem. In the case of the Tekakwitha Woods python, no harm was done (that we know of). An animal control expert captured the snake, which was put up for adoption with a more responsible owner. But untold numbers of pets released in natural areas are not retrieved. Scads of them reproduce and wreak ecological and economic havoc.
Take Chance the Snapper, the headline-grabbing gator in Chicago who held media attention last July. An anonymous pet owner released it in Humboldt Park. A coldblooded creature, Chance would have little chance of survival in our brutal winter, but he could do significant damage to wildlife, people and property in the meantime.
Chance evaded capture for a week. Finally, the city of Chicago brought in the big guns, hiring a gator-trapper from Florida with a price-tag upward of $30,000.
Less ominous than an alligator or a python on the loose is the common goldfish. Yes, the tiny orange fish that you brought home from the pet store in a plastic bag can become a 10-pound monster in the wild.
"Goldfish are one of the world’s worst invasive aquatic species," according to an article in The New York Times. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources reported that goldfish are present in almost all waterways of Illinois.
What makes little Swimmy so pernicious in the wild? Goldfish are omnivorous and fecund — in other words, they’ll eat anything in their path and make tons of babies. They roil up the stream bed and muddy the waters for native species that need clear streams. They also carry diseases that are easily transmitted to native fish.
Other animals frequently let loose in natural areas are frogs, birds, and turtles. Lots of turtles. I once watched a woman release an unwanted red-eared slider in the salt marsh where I worked in the San Francisco Bay Area. I couldn’t stop her in time. This eastern, freshwater turtle wasn’t long for the world in the salt marsh.
The best turtle release story can be traced to Al Capone. The Chicago Tribune reported, "In November 1930, a ‘deluge’ of box turtles was ‘mysteriously let loose’ on South Michigan Avenue ... The owner of those turtles … was none other than Al Capone. Capone had attempted to cash in on the increasingly popular sport of turtle racing, hoping to feature it at his speak-easies. … The legendary mobster had an underling purchase 5,000 turtles in Oklahoma. When the venture didn’t pan out, a frustrated Capone had his henchmen dump the turtles, which was how 2,000 of them turned up on Michigan Avenue, and another 3,000 or so surfaced in Cicero."
Scarface’s motives aside, why do people release pets in the wild? Boredom, perhaps? Kids easily tire of sedentary pets. (Box turtles are famously unexciting.) Parents don’t want to clean or feed them. There’s also the expense. Keeping pets costs money, and resentment grows along with the dollars spent on the darn critter.
Like the turtle in the tank, a pet owner finds himself between a rock and a hard place. The animal’s gotta go, but what are the options? Euthanizing the pet seems barbaric and heartless. (And what would you tell the kids?) That leaves the Free Willy solution. Return the animal to the wild and watch it swim/fly/crawl into the sunset.
Hold on a minute. Releasing a pet may seem like a gesture of love, but, in reality, it’s cruel. It’s also illegal in natural areas. The wild is no ecological nirvana for an animal born and raised in captivity.
"The fallout can be catastrophic," according to a July 2019 National Geographic article. "If the animal doesn’t die as a result of predation, exposure, or starvation, it may find a mate, proliferate, and become an invasive species."
What’s the solution? Naturalist Pam Otto with the St. Charles Park District has solid advice.
"First and foremost, realize what you’re getting into before you ever bring the critter home," Otto says. "Budgies, goldfish and rabbits live upward of 10 years; snakes and salamanders over 20 years; turtles anywhere from 30 to 80-plus years, depending on species. Getting an animal when it’s young means you’re signing up for (a long) period of caretaking and responsibility. Instead of getting a hatchling snake, adopt one that’s 15 years old. It will still have 5 to 10 good years left. Boom! You’ve cut your time commitment in half."
If you must part with your pet, Otto says, "Rescue groups are an option. Besides the Chicago Herpetological Society, we’ve worked with Friends of Scales, Fur Angels and the Greater Chicago Caged Bird Club. These are all-volunteer organizations that house homeless pets in foster homes and adopt out via application."
Sometimes pet stores will take healthy, older pets as display animals, she added.
In our heart of hearts, most of us want to do right by the animal. Remember, most pets are not equipped to survive in the wild. Those that do become pests in no time. Say goodbye in a way that respects your pet and the natural environment.

Texto completo: PITTSBURGH -- PITTSBURGH -- Some love nothing more than quietly browsing in a bookshop. Not me: I browse loudly. Especially in secondhand stores. If I find a comely edition of an old favorite, or an intriguing title by an author I don't know, I look up for someone, usually the owner or clerk, to kibbitz with.
All too often, I fail. Used bookstores, in particular, seem to be staffed by those who disdain my lowbrow tastes or resent talking to customers.
Then there's Eric Ackland, the owner of Amazing Books & Records in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He seems to have read or listened to everything in his shop, from Isaac Asimov to Michael Connelly to that small-press biography of a dead Hasidic master. He'll gladly neglect the endless task of computerizing his shelf-busting inventory to talk with you about his beloved 19th-century authors like George Eliot and Dostoyevsky, or his fine selection of Jewish theology. On his way to becoming an Orthodox Jew in his 30s, Ackland briefly took an interest in Christian apologetics, and one day last winter we talked G.K. Chesterton as the store's hi-fi piped early Pat Benatar.
"A bookstore clerk or owner is inevitably something of a therapist," Ackland, 47, said more recently. "I've worked dozens of retail and restaurant jobs, and this is the one that seems to invite the greatest degree of intimacy, probably because people think that the shop-person doesn't have anything to do but read and talk."
Squirrel Hill is one of the oldest Jewish neighborhoods in the country, home to synagogues such as the Tree of Life, where 11 worshipers, from the three congregations sharing the building, were killed last fall by a gunman shouting anti-Semitic slurs. After the massacre, shops like Amazing Books functioned as sanctuaries.
It is the quintessential Squirrel Hill venture, being obviously commercial -- books coming in by the shopping bag, going out one or two at a time -- and spiritual. I don't mean Ackland's black yarmulke or the ritual fringes visible below his shirttails, but rather the temples to freewheeling curiosity that he has built at this location and his other branch in downtown Pittsburgh.
A Philadelphia native who never finished high school, Ackland moved to Pittsburgh for the woman who eventually became his wife; they are raising her three children from her first marriage and the two they've had together. In 2013, when he was trying to build a freelance copy-writing business, he had gone downtown to the Department of Motor Vehicles, which was closed, and wound up in a store called Awesome Books, which was open. He began chatting up the owner.
"I mentioned how I'd worked in a bookstore like this and at one point had been thinking about opening one," Ackland said. "And he said, 'Well, this one's for sale."' But the owner wasn't selling the name, so after Ackland sank a small inheritance from his grandmother into acquiring the business, in 2013 Awesome Books became Amazing Books. The next year, he opened the Squirrel Hill location and changed the business's name to Amazing Books & Records.
Besides those two branches, which each have about 12,000 books on the floor -- he sells thousands more online -- Ackland has opened and closed two others, in Pittsburgh's Oakland neighborhood and on the South Side. Mistakes, he's made a few, and it doesn't help his bottom line that he stays closed on Saturdays, the Sabbath.
Browsing at Amazing can be pleasurably disorienting. Standard sections like biography and literature are alphabetically organized, but other shelves have a logic all their own. On one, a Calvin and Hobbes compendium sits next to William Burroughs's "Naked Lunch." In the vinyl racks, "The Greatest of Nat King Cole" is one flip away from Elvis Costello and The Attractions' "Goodbye Cruel World."
Ackland raised himself on the Victorians, sci-fi, plot-stuffed beach reads like Pat Conroy and avant-gardists like Henry Miller. Musically, he dug The Ramones, Willie Nelson and Guns N' Roses. "I still have a real affection for, like, early '80s pop ballads, like Air Supply," he said.
Listening to Ackland fret over his affection for Henry Miller, I worried that his ethical punctiliousness must be exhausting. "He wrote about the struggle to become a writer, and that was what I wanted to be," Ackland said. "Yet he was a misogynist and an anti-Semite and a pornographer. I was never comfortable with that aspect of him, but I could take the good and leave the bad. That's how I could rationalize selling him now, is that there is good to be extracted."
In the end, Ackland wants to do right by his customers. He's their bookseller, not their rabbi or tutor. "I feel that far too many book- and record-store owners and employees are better-read-and-listened-than-thou and don't at all mind if you know it," he said. "I often think of the Jack Black character in 'High Fidelity' as a prime, if extreme, example: 'Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called to Say I Love You"? Go to the mall."'
A bookstore, like literature and music, should enlarge us, not make us feel small, Ackland said. "Early on in my grand tour of menial jobs, I realized that I had an incredible opportunity to make a moment of a stranger's day better, and that was a priceless thing. A moral obligation, really."

Texto completo: Pacific Standard and Topic, a pair of award-winning publications that stood out from the pack of click-hungry websites, were founded by rich patrons. The generosity of their benefactors allowed them to publish robust journalism at a time when old-line magazine publishers like Time Inc. were being sold for parts -- but it wasn't enough to keep them from folding. Both died this summer, when their backers decided they were no longer worth the expense.
Pacific Standard, a magazine that started in 2008 as a close cousin to academic journals and became a general interest publication with an emphasis on essays and investigative journalism, had its last day of business on Aug. 16, after its main backer, the academic publishing company Sage Publications, withdrew its funding.
Sage, a leading publisher of textbooks and academic works, was co-founded by Sara Miller McCune in New York in 1965. With the fortune she made as a publisher, Ms. Miller McCune became a philanthropist, giving money to cultural institutions, schools and a hospital in her adopted home state of California. She founded Pacific Standard in the middle of the recession but stepped away from it after it had burned through millions of dollars.
Nicholas Jackson, the editor in chief since 2015, said in an interview that the end came as a surprise. "We've been operating with the understanding that we're delivering on everything they've asked of us and, in fact, overperforming," Mr. Jackson said, referring to the site's readership of a few million a month.
Pacific Standard, which had an annual budget of $ 3.2 million, had recently brought aboard several employees and fellows, including its first director of marketing and fund-raising. Some new hires moved in recent months to Santa Barbara, Calif., where the magazine had its headquarters. The expansion followed a decision last year to phase out the print edition.
Blaise R. Simqu, the chief executive of Sage, said the company stopped funding the magazine to focus on academic publishing, which has recently been challenged by digital technology. "My role as C.E.O. is to make decisions now so that Sage is here in five to 10 years," Mr. Simqu said. According to Mr. Simqu, Ms. Miller McCune, 78, no longer has an operational role in the company.
In its more than 10 years, Pacific Standard won two National Magazine Awards, including one in the public interest category. Its occasionally viral stories included an early report on young converts to the far right and an unlikely history of toast.
Clive Parry, a Sage executive, said in an emailed statement that the magazine might have survived if it had been "self-sustaining." But Mr. Jackson and his predecessor as editor in chief, Maria Streshinsky, said the magazine's business model did not include a plan to raise millions in annual revenue. "There was talk about fund-raising, but that wasn't the way Sara seemed to want to go," Ms. Streshinsky said, referring to Ms. Miller McCune.
The loss of the publication leaves digital media a little less brainy. "Even when they were writing about the debate of the day or the moment, they were doing it in an intelligent way," said Casey Cep, a former columnist for the magazine who now writes regularly for The New Yorker, The New York Times and other publications.
Topic, in its two years of existence, was the rare digital publication that combined a high-minded sensibility and lush multimedia presentations heavy on video documentaries and photo essays. Like Pacific Standard, it was largely dependent on a single deep-pocketed patron.
The publication was part of First Look Media, a company started by the billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Drew Wilson, the chief operating officer and chief financial officer of First Look Media, said that closing Topic was "more a business decision than a creative decision."
The magazine was built on the idea that, along with the rest of First Look Media's entertainment studio, it would subsidize the company's nonprofit division, First Look Media Works. That is the home of the investigative news site The Intercept, which was founded in 2014 by the journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Jeremy Scahill.
"Pierre's grand plan was to take a for-profit that could grow into funding the nonprofit," Mr. Wilson said.
In 2017, First Look Media Works had an operating deficit of more than $ 12 million, according to tax documents. That same year, Topic made its debut with an issue centered on the theme "State of the Union."
In that issue, the editor in chief, Anna E. Holmes, said Topic was meant to be a respite from the noisy internet. "Developing an integrated, nuanced point of view is a luxury that requires time and space," wrote Ms. Holmes, who, before joining Topic, was the founding editor of the feminist blog Jezebel. (Ms. Holmes declined to comment for this story.)
"We were not trying to contribute to the content or hot-takes glut," said Madeline Leung Coleman, the publication's managing editor, "and we never felt any pressure to do so. As anyone who has worked in online media can attest, that's exceedingly rare."
After its first year, Topic won both National Magazine Awards pertaining to video.
The investigative journalist Cat Ferguson, who wrote for Topic, bemoaned its loss, saying, "The checklist of places you can do weird stuff that people are actually interested in is shrinking."
In addition to closing Topic, First Look Media has stopped funding another of its publications, The Nib, a digital comics magazine now publishing independently. The company has also entered into negotiations to buy Passionflix, a streaming service focused on the romance genre, according to two people with knowledge of discussions.
Mr. Wilson would not confirm or deny the company's interest in Passionflix. A spokeswoman for Passionflix, a company co-founded by Tosca Musk, the sister of the Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, declined to comment on the possible deal.
Sharon Bloyd-Peshkin, a journalism professor at Columbia College of Chicago, said that the demise of Topic and Pacific Standard "illustrates the perils of just one funder."
Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones, a nonprofit publication that does not rely on a single patron, seconded that point. "It's great when wealthy individuals step up, but their interests can change," Ms. Jeffery said. "Journalism is something readers need to support."

Texto completo: Earlier this month the Rev. Rob Schenck, a former anti-abortion activist, wrote an essay for Time magazine under the headline: "My Words Led to Violence. Now Trump's Are Too."
In it, Schenck talks about how he used to tell audiences at rallies that doctors who performed abortions were "murderers, callous profiteers in misery, monsters and even pigs."
Adding, "Then someone on the fringe of my movement shot and killed Barnett Slepian, an OB/GYN in Buffalo, N.Y., whom I called out by name in demonstrations and clinic blockades. Slepian wasn't the last person to die or be gravely injured by individuals who may have taken literally what I thought of at the time as harmless rhetoric. I now live with great sorrow and regret that it took me so long to learn incendiary speechifying can too often turn deadly."
Schenck points to the massacre in El Paso and worries about how the suspect in the case was mimicking language used by President Donald Trump and others when he said he was killing people as a "response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas".
The New York Times went through five years of transcripts from Fox News, CNN and MSNBC looking for terms like "invasion" when it came to the topic of immigration.
The paper found what it called a "striking degree of overlap between the words of right-wing media personalities and language used by the Texas killer in El Paso."
William Kristol, the conservative writer and Trump critic, described how the president and the hosts on FOX play off one another, saying, "It's a bit of a vicious cycle. Something is said on FOX News, and Trump repeats it, and that legitimizes it..."
Words can become the instruments of violence when a subject is dehumanized. Calling asylum seekers an "invasion," and "infestation" or worse can make it seem to those on the fringe that extermination is a logical solution.
Trump led the "birther" movement against former President Barack Obama. He has vilified Muslims. He described those from Africa or Haiti as coming from "s---hole" countries. He gave what appeared to be a stamp of approval to the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville by saying there were "very fine people on both sides."
He managed at once to come off as racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and ignorant by suggesting that four Democratic congresswomen of color "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."
And he has been unrelenting in his use of "invasion" and worse when it comes to migrants at the southwest border.
There's an old saying, variously attributed to everyone from Buddha to Mahatma Ghandi that begins:
"Be careful of your thoughts, for your thoughts become your words.
"Be careful of your words, for your words become your actions..."
Rev. Schenck, the former anti-abortion activist, ends his essay for Time by saying, "Trump needs to learn the terrible lesson I did — that words matter, even to the point of life and death."
Years ago, I spent several weeks in the beautiful mountain city of Cuernavaca, Mexico.
At a gathering there a lifelong resident of the city was railing in English to me about the behavior of some foreign tourists. His wife grabbed his arm and scolded him in mumbled Spanish that I couldn't quite understand.
I asked the daughter of the family I was staying if she could translate.
She told me, "She was telling husband, 'You must chew your words before you spit them out.'"
After a pause she added, "But sometimes I think it is better to eat them."

Taking Charge in the N.B.A.

Texto completo: There is no other business like the N.B.A. Its rainbow jump shots, rim-rattling dunks and heart-pounding drama are gleaming monuments to black America. Nearly 80 percent of league players are black. They are multimillionaire superstars, international icons and global purveyors of African-American excellence and culture.
Yet, for all of their success, most of them cannot look at N.B.A. leadership and see their own reflections. The vast majority of head coaches are white, as are most general managers and other league executives. Of the men and women with controlling interests in N.B.A. teams, only one, Michael Jordan of the Charlotte Hornets, looks like most of the players on his team.
This stark divide, and the familiar questions it raises about white people overseeing the toil of African-Americans, adds a layer of tension that ripples just beneath the glamour of the N.B.A. Much of what transpires in the league can be seen through the lens of race, especially this summer, when players upended the usual power dynamics by forcing a flurry of trades and transformational free-agent signings.
Consider the debate sparked by Draymond Green, the Golden State Warriors' voluble All-Star forward, when he cast a wary eye on the league, its power structure and its racial tensions.
______
______
In a string of public comments last fall that included an appearance on LeBron James's HBO talk show, Green questioned how the white men and women who control all but one of the N.B.A'.s 30 teams are described.
"The word 'owner,"' Green said, "it dates back to slavery."
It has been 400 years since chattel slavery began in what is now the United States. But Green suggested that the lexicon of 1619 -- with African slaves and white owners, with people as currency -- should be reworked when it comes to a business with the N.B.A.'s racial dynamic.
His remedy? "Maybe use the word 'chairman' instead."
The league was already steering away from "owner," though no official edict has been issued and Commissioner Adam Silver has said he's fine with the word when it's used in careful context. At N.B.A. headquarters, officials use "governor" as often as possible. Nonetheless, Silver told The New York Times in a recent interview that Green's commentary was important.
"Draymond achieved the desired effect," Silver said, explaining that the three-time N.B.A. All-Star had provoked increased sensitivity about the relationship between players and what Silver called "team owners."
Consider, too, the dizzying events of this June and July: Anthony Davis forced his way to the Los Angeles Lakers by demanding a trade away from the New Orleans Pelicans; a bevy of the league's best players -- Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard and others -- opted to leave their teams, pair with superstar friends and play in new cities. Last summer, James left the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Lakers.
The N.B.A. has never seen anything like it.
On one level, it's about money.
But the storm of movement can also be seen as something more profound. Each elite player who bolted to a new team is black. Each had endured years with little control over his destiny. Each played for a team he was forced to join after the N.B.A. draft. Each, for long stretches, had been treated as a business asset, a cog in a machine who could be dumped or traded on a whim.
What we're seeing now is about value beyond money. It's about power, history and the long quest for black self-determination, said David J. Leonard, a professor at Washington State University who has written about race, culture and sports. According to Leonard, a line can be traced to the modern N.B.A. from antebellum slavery.
"One way to think about slavery is as a history of confinement and the struggle of movement -- being moved against your will or seeking to break free of those chains," he said. "A connection can be made to what we're seeing in the league today, to the drive among black players to freely move and control one's future, control one's life and likeness, story and voice. All of this is part of a larger history in black America."
This struggle, of course, is not new. In the 1960s, Bill Russell, the Hall of Fame center for the Boston Celtics, was outspoken about race and social justice.
Nor is the struggle confined to basketball. In 1969, Curt Flood led a charge for free agency in baseball, where teams had been able to control the fate of a player for an entire career. Flood's critics, echoing today's "shut up and play" chorus targeting outspoken black athletes, said ballplayers were wealthy and should not complain about limits to their autonomy.
He replied: "A well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave."
But in the modern N.B.A., one particular event ushered in a fresh drive for player power.
In 2014, the league was finally forced to deal with Donald Sterling, a real estate mogul who owned the Los Angeles Clippers despite allegations he practiced racial discrimination in renting apartments. The tipping point came when an audio recording surfaced of Sterling telling a girlfriend that it bothered him when she associated with African-Americans. He asked her not to bring them to games.
His statements drew immediate wrath from players, who banded together and pressed for Sterling to be ousted. James, then playing for the Miami Heat, made their stance clear: "There's no room for Donald Sterling in the N.B.A.," he said. Within days, Silver banned Sterling from the league.
To David West, who retired last year after a 15-year career in which he was an All-Star known for astute views on black empowerment, Sterling's comments pushed the league's players to realize their power as never before.
"Sterling is a part of the story that gets lost," he said. "Being able to hear those words from someone in his position, the intent behind them, it definitely rang a bell for us. It was such a powerful moment."
"We came together as never before and let our discontent be known," he added. "And doing all of that helped change the league dynamic."
The N.B.A., post-Sterling, is a different place.
Gone are the days when Jordan or Magic Johnson or Kobe Bryant toed the corporate line during the peak of their careers. Today's stars feel emboldened to speak openly about race, to advocate social justice, to publicly debate issues like slavery and its enduring effects.
They're led by James and encouraged by Silver, who has boasted of seeing players as partners. Tension around race is not something to run from, Silver said in his interview, as long as it is discussed openly and honestly. Debate done right, he said, can be "an antidote to the fear and isolation that have become so prevalent in our society."
Still, player clout has limits, Mark Anthony Neal, chair of the Department of African and African American Studies at Duke University, cautioned. He cited Warriors Coach Steve Kerr's recent criticism of players who tried to force trades while under contract. Neal also cited when Phil Jackson, the Hall of Fame coach, referred to James's African-American friends and business partners as a "posse" in 2016.
"Phil Jackson is one of the figures in the league that we see as relatively woke," Neal said. What does that say, he added, about team owners who have racial views that are considered less enlightened?
"At some point," he said, "those folks are going to mobilize to push back."
Four hundred years on, the sin of slavery continues to haunt. Its repercussions infect politics, art, education, every community, every last corner of American life. The N.B.A. -- indeed, all of sports -- is not immune.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS, Ohio - Disturbing behavior that the Dayton gunman reportedly exhibited in his youth may be detailed in law enforcement and school files so far off limits to the public, records that could shed light on whether authorities properly handled early warning signs.
The measures used to shield 24-year-old shooter Connor Betts' school records and whatever is on his juvenile rap sheet were intended to protect people's privacy as they move from childhood into their adult lives.
But could erasing youthful bad behavior from the public record limit insights that could protect public safety? And might such measures also serve to insulate school officials from having their decisions questioned?
"Obviously, it's a very, very complex issue, said Rachael Strickland, co-chair of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy.
Betts was killed by police after opening fire Aug. 4 in the city's crowded Oregon District entertainment area, killing nine, including his sister, and injuring dozens more.
High school classmates have since said Betts was suspended years ago for compiling a "hit list of fellow students he wanted to harm. Two of the classmates said that followed an earlier suspension after Betts came to school with a list of female students he wanted to sexually assault.
Police investigators say they now know that Betts had a "history of obsession with violent ideations with mass shootings and expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting. The FBI said it uncovered evidence Betts "looked into violent ideologies.
On Thursday, the Montgomery County coroner said Betts had cocaine, alcohol and an antidepressant in his system and more cocaine on his body at the time of the shooting.
Authorities have yet to publicly identify a motive, and the shielded records could provide insights into Betts' previous activities both in and out of school. Dayton police said Tuesday that they're divided on one of the more vexing questions: whether Betts intended to kill his sister, Megan, or whether her death was inadvertent.
His school district, Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local Schools, has denied media requests for access to Betts' high school files on the grounds that such "records are generally protected by both federal and state law. News organizations, including The Associated Press, CNN, The New York Times and others, have sued.
Likewise, his juvenile police record has been expunged, which makes it off limits to the public.
Strickland said her coalition mostly focuses on protecting children from the lifelong ramifications of systematic monitoring of their social media. She said the group opposes "as a matter of principle government surveillance of children without due process, saying it takes staff and police hours to carry out while "unfairly labeling kids.
That was part of the thinking of those who championed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the federal law that protects student education records, back in 1974. The act does give districts the option to release a student's records "in connection with an emergency, however.
"The mandate to Ohio schools is that we must not divulge confidential student records without clear consent from the student or parents and we have not received such consent, Liz Betz, board president for Bellbrook-Sugarcreek Local Schools, said in a statement after the shooting. "We know everyone is trying to make sense of the devastation that occurred, but we cannot bypass the law, plain and simple.
While the U.S. Department of Education holds that federal privacy protections cease upon death for those over 18, the school district is arguing that Ohio law provides broader protection.
The district's lawyer, Tabitha Justice, said that if the protections expire, as the media organizations have argued, that would mean "that the families and estates of all students who pass away, regardless of the manner of death, would be entirely without recourse with respect to those records.
In their complaint, the news outlets also argued the records can make a significant contribution to local and national debate that has followed the shooting.
"Respondents' failure to comply with their legal obligations under Ohio law should not be tolerated, the complaint said. "This community and the country at large deserve to know why this tragedy happened, what might have led to it, and what may be done to prevent future tragedies.
Michael Miller, a former longtime Franklin County prosecutor, said expungement is also a tool aimed at helping people - even well into their adulthood - avoid lifelong negative consequences for the mistakes of their past.
Lawyers sometimes offer to expunge a person's record as part of their service agreement or, if the offense is minor, some magistrates do it automatically, he said.
Miller said he puts no stock in a person's bad behavior as a teenager being a predictor of future violence.
"They're all over the map on why they do these things, he said. "It's virtually impossible to think that if we do this or that, we'll stop violence and killing people. It's been going on since the beginning of time.

Texto completo: Latino actors, writers pen 'letter of solidarity' amid fears
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Actresses America Ferrera and Eva Longoria are leading a group of more than 150 writers, artists and leaders who have written a public "letter of solidarity" to U.S. Latinos after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, and an immigration raid in Mississippi.
The letter, published Friday in The New York Times and in a handful of Spanish-language newspapers, says the signers stand with U.S. Latinos who may feel "terrified, heartbroken and defeated by the barrage of attacks," citing the shooting in El Paso, which targeted Hispanics, and another shooting in Gilroy, Calif. The two attacks killed nearly two dozen Latinos.
A huge immigration raid of Mississippi poultry plants this month that rounded up 680 mostly Latino workers, leaving behind crying children searching for their detained parents, also has unnerved some Hispanics.
"We have been smeared by political rhetoric and murdered in violent hate crimes. We have been separated from our families and have watched our children caged," the letter said. "But, we will not be broken. We will not be silenced."
The letter says such "indignities and cruelty" won't diminish the contributions Latinos have made to the U.S., and it urged Hispanics to keep standing up to bigotry.
Signing the letter were some of the most important Latino figures in entertainment, art, literature and activism, including novelist Sandra Cisneros, Academy Award-winning actress Rita Moreno, civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, singer-actress Jennifer Lopez and Tony Award-winning composer Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Texto completo: Margie Reckard, de 63 años, que fue asesinada cuando un hombre armado abrió fuego en un Walmart de El Paso este mes, dejó pocos familiares y ninguno vive en El Paso. Su esposo, Antonio Basco, no tenía otra familia e invitó a la comunidad a acompañarlo durante el servicio fúnebre.
Cientos de personas hicieron fila afuera y se apiñaron en La Paz Faith Memorial and Spiritual Center en El Paso para asistir a los servicios funerarios de Reckard el viernes por la noche. En un momento durante el funeral del viernes, se dijo que 700 personas esperaban afuera a pesar del calor de casi 100 grados, según los organizadores del funeral.
El lugar para los servicios del viernes puede albergar hasta 400 personas.

Perches Funeral Home escribió por primera vez en una publicación de Facebook esta semana que Antonio Basco esperaba que tanta gente como fuera posible asistiera al funeral, señalando que la pareja no tenía familiares vivos.
“El Sr. Antonio Basco estuvo casado durante 22 años con su esposa Margie Reckard. No tenía otra familia. Le da la bienvenida a cualquiera que asista a los servicios de su esposa”, escribió la funeraria.
Los residentes de El Paso, Víctor y Mary Perales, le dijeron al New York Times que vinieron a apoyar a Basco en parte porque estaban relacionados con su dolor debido a la pérdida de su hijo mayor hace dos años.
“Sabemos lo difícil que fue para nosotros y estábamos rodeados de familia. No puedo imaginar cómo se sentiría pasar por esto solo “, dijo Victor Perales. “Dije que íbamos a este funeral para darle un abrazo y hacerle saber que podemos ser su familia”.

Trump's China policy: Incoherent and value-free

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country's foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China's dictatorship.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping's brutally authoritarian rule.
"He's now president for life. President for life. And he's great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they're going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that's between Hong Kong and that's between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
We count on presidents to consider "just in case" issues before they act. With Trump, it's all a thoughtless, strategy-less blur. Say anything, see how it goes, then say something else.
He charmingly expressed concern about the effect of the tariffs on "the Christmas shopping season," thus effectively contradicting his own false claims that Chinese, not Americans, would pay the tariffs.
What's maddening about Trump's approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States' traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China's abuses, Trump's erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump's affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation's domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

Texto completo: Nearly as soon as an explosion ripped through the Nenoksa Missile Test Site in northern Russia on Aug. 8, briefly raising radiation levels in the region, the Kremlin went into crisis mode. That, to anyone familiar with the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl accident, means clamping down on information, insisting that nothing really bad happened, that it happens everywhere and that the government is in full control.
This time, thank heaven, the radiation leak appears not to have threatened residents in the region, and no increases were registered in neighboring Finland or Norway. But the pathetic, inchoate evasiveness of Russian authorities proved once again that the Kremlin is far more concerned with covering its behind than telling its people or the world what happened and how great the risk it carried.
When city authorities in nearby Severodvinsk reported the brief spike in radiation levels soon after the explosion, sending panicked people in search of iodine, which protects the thyroid gland against absorbing radiation, Moscow’s reaction was to take the information off the city’s website.
Initial reports were only of a “liquid fueled rocket engine” blowing up, with assurances that such accidents were a normal risk in the important research that was underway and that such mishaps had occurred also in the United States and Japan.
The five scientists who perished, Russians were proudly informed, were great heroes who would receive major decorations and their families many rubles.
Oh, and yes, officials noted two days later, the scientists had been “involved in servicing isotope power sources on a liquid fuel engine.” That was followed by a lot of scientific jargon (the research involved “the creation of sources of thermal or electric energy using radioactive materials, including fissile materials and radioisotope materials”) but no concrete information about what the poor scientists — who according to some reports were flung into the White Sea by the blast — had been working on.
Sorting through what hints were available in the statements, United States intelligence officials said one project potentially involved in the blast was the development of a nuclear-powered cruise missile capable of evading American missile defenses on very long flights, known to NATO as the Skyfall and to Russia as the Burevestnik. President Vladimir Putin had bragged of such a weapon in his annual state of the nation address in 2018.
If that’s what it was, the setback in the testing program would be a serious blow to Putin at a time he is facing weekly demonstrations in Moscow by tens of thousands of Russians irked by the exclusion of opposition politicians from the race for the Moscow City Council, and more broadly by the erosion of living standards.
A nuclear accident in a costly arms program that he publicly embraced is not what Putin needs.
The folly of the accelerating post-Soviet Cold War is a major issue in itself, as is Putin’s illusion, carried over from the Soviet Union, that military might, however prohibitively costly and unnecessary, equals national greatness. Secrecy is critical to any arms race to keep the adversary off balance, and Moscow has always been obsessive about shrouding its military programs from view.
Yet the Kremlin should have understood with brutal clarity after Chernobyl that there can be no secrecy surrounding a nuclear accident, no matter how great or small, no matter how clandestine its source. Thousands of lives might have been saved at Chernobyl with prompt warnings.
Fortunately, the accident on the White Sea was no Chernobyl, and it will most likely pose no further threat to people’s lives. And the real threat to Putin is not the failure of a missile test, nor whatever light it shed on Russian nuclear weapons programs that Putin himself so publicly announced.
The greatest danger is that the government’s instinctive lies and denials will only make the Russian public, and the world, even less likely to believe in anything Putin or his minions say or do when the next crisis hits.

A friendly parlor game turns deadly Amy Whey's uncomplicated, ordinary life as a wife and mother in a small Florida town begins to unravel when she and her good friend Charlotte welcome Roux, a charismatic new neighbor, into their suburban book club. A drinking game that Roux initiates — a spicy version of "Never Have I Ever" — seems harmless to everyone but Amy, who senses that something vicious has come her way. Amy has a secret, a crime she committed nearly 30 years ago, and her fears about the new neighbor are confirmed when Roux makes it clear to Amy when they are alone that she knows her secret and is prepared to blackmail her.
Amy knows that she must take Roux on in order to protect her family and her hard-won "normal," messy life. When she discovers that Roux has her own secrets to hide, Amy finds herself stronger and more devious than she thought she could be. Joshilyn Jackson serves up dramatic reveals and twisty turns that make us question our initial assumptions about Amy and make the novel as much an engaging story of moral suspense as an exciting psychological thriller.
In "Never Have I Ever," Jackson has written a compulsively readable, nail-biter of a novel about betrayal, deception, temptation, and love. The book was selected as an American Bookseller Association ABA Indie Next Pick, a Recommended Summer Read by The Wall Street Journal and the Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and an American Library Association Library Reads Pick.
Join us as New York Times-bestselling author Joshilyn Jackson presents "Never Have I Ever" at Malaprop's Bookstore/Cafe at 6 p.m. Aug. 19.

Choosing love "T, my throat does not move ... You trap air with your tongue against the roof of your mouth, release the tongue downward. M, I press my lips together and make a circle to start the rest. Mo, air comes out to finish the sound."
So begins the saga of T-Mo, with a naming based on the feel of holding a name in the mouth. Our main character is split into two distinct personalities from birth: T-Mo, a loving and playful boy with "poems in his eyes," and Odysseus, a cruel, hateful child who holds loyalty only to his father, who skirted the norms of a matriarchal society to name his son.
This power grab exerts a ripple effect on the rest of the story, touching every character that has a connection to T-Mo or Odysseus. We watch as the characters fighting for T-Mo against Odysseus try to overcome their personal faults in order to bridge the gulfs between them created by a cruel world. T-Mo is a character that could be you or someone else you know, split in half by divided loyalties that can be made whole again only through acts of love. "Claiming T-Mo" reminds us how we can still choose love to heal rather than cutting someone out of our heart because of their internal struggles.
Join us in celebrating the release of Eugen Bacon's debut novel, "Claiming T-Mo," at Malaprop's at 6 p.m. Aug. 22. She will be in conversation with Alexandra Duncan, author of "Blight."

New York medical examiner: Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein's death was officially ruled a suicide Friday evening, as the New York City medical examiner's office said the jet-setting financier and accused child sex trafficker hanged himself in his jail cell. The autopsy was completed on Sunday.
Dr. Barbara Sampson said that "after careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings, the determination on the death of Jeffrey Epstein" was that its "cause" was "hanging" and its "manner" was "suicide," according to a statement obtained by the Washington Examiner.

The medical examiner's office said Epstein appeared to have tied a bedsheet to the top of a bunk bed and then moved toward the floor with enough force to break bones in his neck, according to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
Epstein’s attorneys — Martin Weinberg, Reid Weingartern, and Michael Miller — released a statement condemning the prison for letting Epstein die and making it clear that they were “not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner.”
“The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein’s death, including, if necessary, legal action to view the pivotal videos — if they exist as they should — of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein’s cell during the time period leading to his death,” the lawyers said.
Sampson previously released a statement Sunday evening saying a final determination was “pending further information.” On Saturday morning, a representative for the medical examiner’s office told the Washington Examiner that “there is no official cause of death yet” because “the medical examiner has to do their job.”
In response to media reports that Epstein's hyoid bone had been broken, which some suggested indicated a homicidal strangulation rather than a suicide, Samspson pushed back on Thursday.
"In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death," Sampson said. "Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum.”
The Bureau of Prisons said on Saturday that Epstein was found “unresponsive in his cell” in the special housing unit that morning around 6:30 a.m. following “an apparent suicide.” Attorney General William Barr also said Epstein died by “apparent suicide,” and he ordered the FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general to investigate both the incident in July and Saturday’s death.

The Daily Beast reported Epstein’s body was collected from the medical examiner’s office on Wednesday by Epstein’s brother, Mark, who notably offered up his own home as collateral when Epstein was fighting to be allowed out of jail on house arrest back in July.

Many questions remain about why Epstein was reportedly taken off suicide watch despite allegedly being found nearly unconscious on his cell floor with marks on his neck back on July 23. An internal investigation was completed regarding the July 23 incident, and the ongoing investigations by the FBI and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death will also cover it. There are also numerous questions about why such a high-profile prisoner wasn’t being closely monitored.
There were numerous alleged failures at the prison that have emerged in the last few days, including: Epstein not having a cellmate; corrections officers violating protocol by not checking on Epstein every thirty minutes despite him previously being on suicide watch; one guard assigned to watch Epstein not normally working as a corrections officer; prison guards working mandatory overtime shifts multiple days in a row and 60 or 70-hour work weeks; guards not being trained properly; guards falling asleep on the job; and the records about how often Epstein was being checked on being falsified.
Barr said he was “appalled” Monday to learn of Epstein’s apparent suicide and revealed the DOJ was “learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.” Barr also said there will be accountability for those who did not do their jobs properly.
The DOJ said Tuesday that the warden for the prison had been “temporarily reassigned” to a northeast regional office “pending the outcome” of investigations currently underway. Two other prison staffers were placed on administrative leave. Barr said Monday that he was “learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation.”
Epstein, the already convicted sex offender and financier, allegedly sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girl at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations, between 2002 and 2005, and perhaps beyond. Prosecutors claimed Epstein enticed and recruited minor girls to engage in sex acts with him and built a “vast network of underage victims.”

Texto completo: A panel on CNN questioned 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren on Friday for her decision to release two policy proposals targeting Native Americans.
Asma Khalid of NPR, Michael D. Shear of The New York Times, Dana Bash of CNN, and Tarini Parti of the Wall Street Journal appeared on Inside Politics to discuss Warren's newest policy proposal. During the conversation, they brought up her previous claim that she was of Native American ancestry, only for a DNA test to prove otherwise.
"I mean, you know, the issues of Native Americans in the country are I’m sure very important, but I don’t know that the Democratic Party is clamoring for a massive policy position on it and she could well have decided, why poke the bear, right?" Shear said. "Why put this so out front that President Trump can come in and raise this again, and she’s going to have more interviews like the one where she wasn’t very comfortable?"
"This is not just about righting a political wrong or potential misstep early in the campaign with that DNA test, it’s about getting voters," Bash said. "She has to right any potential wrong that the Native American community sees in her candidacy and her — you know, her history here, and that’s obviously poked at by President Trump."
Host John King added, “The use of the term ‘Pocahontas’ is offensive, but the issue does come up to the point about electability that you were raising and not just in Republican circles."
'Why poke the bear?' — CNN panel questions Warren releasing Native American policy
The show then aired a clip of Warren's appearance on "Breakfast Club," during which Charlamagne tha God brought up her previous claims of Native American heritage and suggested she was "the original Rachel Dolezal a little bit."
“But it’s a topic she’s still not totally comfortable with," Khalid responded. "We sat down with NPR politics last week. I spent half an hour on a wide-ranging interview with her, and I did ask her this question about some folks, even some Democrats, do question whether your judgment on race may be off. I will say, the entire rest of the interview, I felt she was completely comfortable moving to policy positions."
She continued, "Her response to that question, she shifted again to a policy position. I think that’s where she’s comfortable and I don’t know that she feels fully comfortable yet in terms of how to answer these questions that even Democrats have about whether her judgment on race might be off.”

Gail Collins: Let’s think of ways to torture Trump

Texto completo: Let’s be trivial for a minute. Forget our endless supply of critical problems and just try to think of a good way to torture Donald Trump.
Psychologically.
Reasoned criticism never works. We have to go down to his level if we want to get his attention. Not by making fun of his hair or his girth or the orangish glow of his face. Deriding people for their looks is beneath us. Besides, he seems so confident he’s a charmer nothing is going to shake him.
If we want to really make him crazy, we ought to start a rumor that he can’t draw a crowd.
You know how obsessed Trump is with this subject. Whenever he holds a rally — which seems to be pretty much every other day — he brags about the enormous number of people thronging in to see him:
“There have never been crowds like this, just so you understand, in the history of politics.”
“This is some record crowd.”
“I’ve broken more Elton John [attendance] records, and I don’t have a musical instrument.”
There are two important points about that last comment. One is that the president went on to say that his only musical instrument was his mouth, “and hopefully the brain is attached to the mouth.” There are so many ways, really, we could have finished that thought.
The other is that Elton John is a way bigger draw.
Trump can’t bear suggestions that he’s not a crowd megamagnet. Every time he gets on a stage, he seems compelled to claim the audience is of epic proportions. The place is packed! Not to mention the masses waiting outside!
Back in February, he did an event in El Paso, Texas, on the same day Beto O’Rourke was holding his own rally. The one-sided fight over who had the biggest crowd became sort of insane — not to mention sort of phallic. “We have, let’s say, 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good!” the president of the United States crowed.
The beat-Beto obsession went on and on. O’Rourke, in one of the better moments of his political career, said that analysis “just shows you how sick this guy is.” It also showed how bad Trump is at math — local fire officials said that the capacity of his auditorium was around 6,500, and there were, at the most, 10,000 more people standing outside. O’Rourke had crowd estimates of up to 15,000.
If only there were headlines all around Texas announcing, “Trump Audience Size Disappointing.” Or better yet: “Did Beto Draw Better?” Can you imagine how miserable that would make the commander in chief?
Maybe that’s going too far — despite the president’s complaints to the contrary, the mainstream-media reporters covering him try very hard to be fair. However, we’re in the Opinion section right now. So let’s be catty.
The El Paso crowd became a national issue last week when Trump went to visit the victims of the Walmart shooting while the whole nation wondered if the tragedy was set off by the president’s rants about Mexicans at the border.
None of the patients wanted to see him, so Trump hung out with the staff. Almost instantly, he veered off into a reminiscence about that El Paso rally. “That place was packed. … We had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto — Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot,” he burbled.
Nobody was going to challenge Trump’s numbers while standing, perhaps awe-struck, listening to the president of the United States brag about his crowd size in the wake of a terrible mass murder. And nobody was going to ask about it at his next press conference, since there hasn’t been one for more than 900 days.
Even Trump must have discovered that this was going way, way over the deep end. He refrained from saying a whole lot about attendance when he spoke in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. He did peer toward the media section and note that there were “a lot of people” for an 11 a.m. event. It was a point only slightly dulled by the fact that it was 2:42 in the afternoon.
The rally took place on the construction site of a big chemical plant. “It was the Trump administration that made it possible,” the president said of a project that was first announced in 2012. The trip was supposed to be an official White House speech about energy policy. That means you the taxpayer were underwriting his opportunity to brag about his victory margin in 2016 in West Virginia, make fun of Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, and announce the new numbers from Florida showed his re-election campaign was “looking fantastically good.”
He spoke to a crowd of about 5,000. Analyzing his effort, the reasonable thing to do would be to point out the deep, deep fault lines in his arguments about energy and economics. But you know he’d be oblivious. What if the headlines read “Disappointing Crowd for a Presidential Visit” and the stories focused on the fact that earlier this year in nearby Pittsburgh, Trevor Noah drew a healthy turnout at an arena that seats 12,500?
Not responsible journalism. But maybe it’d shock him into reality. Or at least leave him curled up in bed, sucking his thumb while somebody else ran the government.

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, values-free

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People." When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke is coming to Mississippi Friday, according to his campaign.
O'Rourke, a former U.S. representative from El Paso, Texas, had taken a break from campaigning after 22 people were gunned down in a Walmart at the city on the U.S.-Mexico border.
O'Rourke's campaign said he will "offer the Jackson, Mississippi, immigrant community support" after federal agents raided chicken processing plants in Morton, arresting nearly 700 people suspected of being in the country illegally.
In a Thursday speech, O'Rourke said immigrants had been "terrorized" in recent days —both by the El Paso shooting, and during the federal raids in Mississippi.
"Six hundred people who came to this country for the privilege of working the toughest, s---tiest jobs, that no one else here would allow their children to work — in chicken processing plants, in picking cotton, in working in the gym, working two or three shifts, maybe making a minimum wage, if they are lucky," O'Rourke said. "Far too often, their immigration status is used as leverage against them to pay them something far less or nothing at all. The kind of modern day bondage that is taking place right now in America."
Details of the visit According to an email from his campaign, O'Rourke will visit a Hispanic grocery store in Canton at 10:30 a.m.
There had been a second event planned for the afternoon at a Hispanic outreach center run by the Methodist church, but that event was canceled.
"Due to security concerns, Beto will be meeting with families in private," said Lauren Hitt, a campaign spokeswoman.
The raids detained mostly Latino workers in what marked the largest workplace sting in at least a decade. Of those, about 300 were given future court dates and released, but they can't return to work.
O'Rourke, who unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 2018, has struggled to break into the top tier of Democratic candidates for President.
The New York Times reports that O'Rourke is now framing his campaign "as a moral crusade against" President Donald Trump.

Going From Hong Kong Into the Mainland? Your Phone May Be Searched

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Chinese border officers have begun routinely searching the phones of people who enter mainland China from Hong Kong, raising concerns that Beijing is trying to identify travelers sympathetic to the territory's protest movement and further control what its people see about the unrest.
During the phone checks, officers look through photos, messages and other apps, three people whose devices were searched told The New York Times. As far as the travelers could tell, the people selected for extra inspections were mostly young men. The demonstrations have been largely youth-driven.
The searches have come to light as the protests, now in their third month, have grown increasingly violent and disruptive, drawing sharp denunciations from the mainland Chinese leadership and raising the possibility that it might crack down on the demonstrators.
Chinese paramilitary forces have gathered in Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong. On Thursday, tarp-covered troop transports and armored personnel carriers were seen parked outside a Shenzhen stadium.
The travelers whom The Times interviewed entered the mainland from West Kowloon station in Hong Kong, where the territory connects to China's vast high-speed rail network, and where part of the terminal is under mainland Chinese jurisdiction.
But Au Nok-hin, a pro-democracy member of Hong Kong's legislature, said he had heard in the past week or two about travelers' phones being checked at other crossings along the border, where there is a large flow of people in both directions every day.
"The ideological control from China is very tough," Mr. Au said.
The Chinese authorities are not alone in demanding to examine travelers' cellphones. Warrantless searches of phones and laptops by United States border agents have grown rapidly in recent years.
[President Trump says 'Hong Kong is not helping' in trade war with China.]
Even before train service began last year at the gleaming, clamshell-shaped station in the West Kowloon district, it attracted controversy over the Hong Kong's government decision to allow mainland Chinese officers to enforce mainland law there.
The plan raised concerns among democracy supporters in Hong Kong about a further loss of autonomy for the territory -- the same issue that has been one of the animating forces behind this summer's antigovernment protests.
Billy Li, a representative for the Progressive Lawyers Group, which promotes democracy and the rule of law in Hong Kong, compared the situation to the case of local booksellers who vanished several years ago.
The men were involved in an industry that produced racy potboilers about the mainland's Communist Party leadership. It turned out that they had been taken into custody in mainland China. They gave televised confessions, which one later said had been forced.
The incidents "caused a huge outcry about mainland law being applied in Hong Kong," Mr. Li said. "Now we see it daily in West Kowloon station."
"What we were concerned about has now become a reality," he said.
On the mainland Chinese side of the station on Thursday, travelers described the extra inspection they underwent.
After presenting their IDs, they said, they were taken into a small area enclosed by black canvas panels. There, several uniformed officers were seated at tables, and travelers were asked to unlock their cellphones. Some officers flipped through the phones, while others checked bags and luggage.
At no point did the officers say what they were looking for, the travelers said. All three said that this was the first time the authorities had checked their phones while crossing into mainland China from Hong Kong.
It is not clear, from the travelers' accounts, what the precise purpose of the search was. The officers did not force travelers to delete all images of the protests, although they did seem to keep records of whose phones they searched.
When asked why travelers' phones were being checked, an employee at the train station said the searches were only for "bad people." He did not elaborate.
"I'm not happy about it," said one of the travelers, Hsu Tzu Hung, a science teacher in Shenzhen. "What's the legal basis for this?"
Mr. Hsu, 22, had just flown into Hong Kong on Thursday morning after a trip back to his native Taiwan.
The officers looked at Mr. Hsu's messages on WeChat, a social app that is ubiquitous in mainland China, but did not open the Line messenger, which is popular in Taiwan. Mr. Hsu said he was allowed to leave after around 10 minutes.
Arain Lin, a 26-year-old native of Fujian Province in China, was traveling back to the mainland on Thursday after vacationing in Hong Kong. He said the phone inspection seemed "targeted" at anything connected to the demonstrations.
While his device was being checked, he said, officers seemed particularly interested in the videos he had taken the previous day at Hong Kong's airport, where he dropped off a friend and happened to spot some demonstrations.
The officers at West Kowloon station asked Mr. Lin why he had taken the videos. He told them what he said was the truth: "I was just curious."
In the end, the officers did not order Mr. Lin to delete the videos. Mr. Lin said he could not remember how long the whole thing lasted. He had been too nervous to pay attention.
A Hong Kong resident who gave only his surname, Chen, told The Times that when officers searched his cellphone on Thursday, they asked why he didn't have many photos. He told them it was his backup device.
Wary that such checks might occur, Mr. Chen said he always made sure to leave his main phone at home when he travels to mainland China, and to check what he brings in his bags.
Not that he is happy about having to take such precautions. "It's a pain," he said.
Mr. Chen, 25, was going to the mainland only for the day to visit relatives, so he did not have to carry much luggage, a fact for which he was grateful in light of the extra border inspection.
He said he could only guess what happened to people who were found to have sensitive materials on their devices.
For his backup phone, Mr. Chen has gone so far as to choose a wallpaper meant to dispel the authorities' suspicions: a map of China with yellow stars on a red background, just like the Chinese flag.

Texto completo: ASHIYA, Japan -- When Yoko Ogawa discovered "The Diary of Anne Frank" as a lonely teenager in Japan, she was so taken by it that she began to keep a diary of her own, writing to Anne as if she were a cherished friend.
To conjure the kind of physical captivity that Anne experienced, Ogawa would crawl, notebook in hand, into a drawer or under a table draped with a quilt.
"Anne's heart and mind were so rich," said Ogawa, now 57 and the author of more than 40 novels and story collections. "Her diary proved that people can grow even in such a confined situation. And writing could give people freedom."
Decades later, Ogawa transmuted her imagining of Anne's world into "The Memory Police," a dystopian novel that is Ogawa's fifth book to be translated into English and which goes on sale in the United States this week. It takes place on a mysterious island where an authoritarian government makes whole categories of objects or animals disappear overnight, wiping them from the memories of citizens.
Those who retain their recall are outlaws who go into hiding. The narrator, a novelist, shelters her editor -- who remembers everything -- in a room reminiscent of the Dutch annex where Anne hid with her family.
"I wanted to digest Anne's experience in my own way and then recompose it into my work," said Ogawa during an interview in her home, located in a suburb between Kobe and Osaka.
[ " The Memory Police " was one of our most anticipated titles of August. See the full list . ]
Although "The Memory Police" was first released in Japan in 1994, the novel is particularly resonant now, at a time of rising authoritarianism across the globe. Throughout the book, citizens live under police surveillance. Novels are burned. People are detained and interrogated without explanation. Neighbors are taken away in the middle of the night.
All the while, the citizens, cowed by fear, do nothing to stop the disappearances. "Regardless of what had happened, it was almost certainly an unfortunate event," the narrator explains, "and, moreover, simply talking about it could put you in danger."
Anna Stein, Ogawa's English-language agent, said she and Stephen Snyder, the writer's longtime English-language translator, selected "The Memory Police" for translation in 2014. "Of course the horror of it applies now more than ever in our lifetime," said Stein.
In Japan, where history itself has been subject to revision -- and those who bring up the country's wartime past can be denounced or even censored -- the novel's lament for erased memories could be read as veiled criticism. Yet Ogawa did not intend to write a political allegory, she said. "I am just trying to depict each individual character and how those characters are living in their current time."
Lexy Bloom, a senior editor at Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, said she is drawn to Ogawa's skill with character and detail. "In 'The Memory Police,' she is tackling these big themes, but it's also about these small moments between people," said Bloom, who has long been a fan of Ogawa's work, which was previously published in the United States by Picador. "And that's a hard thing to do effectively."

None of the protagonists in "The Memory Police" are named. Few markers identify the island, a trait shared by some of Ogawa's other novels. "I myself like to keep a certain distance from my native culture or environment," said Ogawa, whose spacious two-story home in an affluent neighborhood overlooking the sea has a Spanish tiled roof, wrought-iron balconies and chairs upholstered in French floral tapestry.
Snyder, a professor of Japanese studies at Middlebury College, said Ogawa's novels relate to Japanese culture in "ancillary ways." Though she raises socially relevant themes, he said, she is never doctrinaire.
"There is a naturalness to what she writes so it never feels forced," he said. "Her narrative seems to be flowing from a source that's hard to identify."
Growing up, Ogawa wrote for herself. When she married a steel company engineer, she quit her job as a medical university secretary -- a common life step for many women of her generation.
While her husband worked, she wrote. She didn't intentionally keep it secret, she said, but her husband only learned about her writing when her debut novel, "The Breaking of the Butterfly," received a literary prize.
"I wasn't telling anyone in a big voice, 'I'm writing a novel,"' she said. "But I always thought, no matter how my life changes, I want to have a life of writing. Whether I could make any money off it, I did not know."
Ogawa gave birth to a son, and when he was just a toddler, her novella "Pregnancy Diary" won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for literature, cementing her reputation in Japan.
She continued to write. "I would change a diaper and then write a sentence," she recalled. "Then I'd make a meal and write a sentence."
Sometimes, Ogawa mused about what it would be like to write without such interruptions. "But now that my son has grown, I feel like I was at my happiest when I was writing while raising my child," she said. "Now that I can write as much as I want 24 hours a day, it's not as if I produce any greater work now than I did in the past."
She now writes at a craftsman desk in an airy room with a twin bed for naps and a bookshelf that slides sideways to reveal another full shelf behind it. A whole section is devoted to books about Anne Frank and the Holocaust. She pulled out a copy of Anne's diary to show that she had tagged virtually every page with a Post-it note.
On her desk, Ogawa keeps a beaver skull, an animal she admires for its industry. It gives her inspiration, she said, echoing the sentiments of the editor in "The Memory Police," who says that touching objects that have disappeared "became a way of confirming that I was still whole."
Ogawa achieved best seller status, and a film adaptation, with "The Professor and the Housekeeper," another novel with memory as its theme. Much lighter in tone than "The Memory Police," it tells the story of a single mother who takes a job as a cook and cleaner for a mathematician who cannot remember anything new for more than 80 minutes.
Along with memory, another of Ogawa's preoccupations is the human capacity for cruelty. "The Diving Pool," a collection of novellas published in English (including the prizewinning "Pregnancy Diary"), features characters who use subterfuge to inflict pain on people close to them. In "Hotel Iris," a sadistic older widower engages a 17-year-old high school dropout in increasingly brutal sexual trysts.
Ogawa said she does not write about cruel characters to damn them but rather to explore what might drive someone to physical or emotional violence. "People try to hide it from others or try to cover it up," she said. "But in the world of literature, you can reveal that nature, and it's O.K. to do so."
Given that she writes vividly about female bodies, and the violence that men can do to them, some critics have dubbed her a feminist writer.
"In a lot of her work she is interested in women's roles in the family and women's bodies," said Kathryn Tanaka, an associate professor of cultural and historical studies at Otemae University in Nishinomiya, Japan. "You really can't separate that from questions of feminism and untangle her from that gendered private space that her texts inhabit."
Ogawa resists the label, saying she considers herself an eavesdropper on her characters. "I just peeked into their world and took notes from what they were doing," she said.
"I see a bridge from that item to the next scene, or I see a rainbow that I have to climb over to move to the next scene," she said. "That's how I write."

Texto completo: LIVONIA, Mich. -- A few months after Dayna Freeland bought her 2008 Ford F-150 last year, she discovered the frame was so badly rusted that it was in danger of breaking apart. Rather than storm into the used-car dealership to complain, though, she took the truck to My Mechanics Place along with an uncorroded frame she had picked up for $ 200 at a salvage yard.
A week later, Ms. Freeland, a 22-year-old doctoral candidate in physics from Milford, Mich., who is also an actor and a model, drove away in her newly stable truck, with a rebuilt timing system to boot. Her total cost was a little over $ 2,000 because, despite having never done such a thing before, she did all the work herself.
My Mechanics Place, in suburban Detroit, is among a couple of dozen do-it-yourself auto repair shops in the United States. It provided the bay, the lift and some tools for $ 125 a day.
For the rest, Ms. Freeland read parts manuals, watched YouTube videos and chatted up the more experienced D.I.Y.-ers working at the garage.
"People keep coming up to me and saying, 'Oh, my God, I can't believe you're doing this, it would suck to do this,' but I love it," Ms. Freeland said, her arm adorned with a reminder to herself, written in black marker, of the correct order for screwing back on the engine's timing cover.
"I started getting into the mechanical stuff out of necessity because mechanics are expensive and I didn't have the budget, so I had to figure it out," she added. "And then I learned that I liked it."
Most customers use My Mechanics Place for simpler tasks like oil changes, brake jobs and tire alignments, said Jay Rabaut, 56, who opened the shop in 2015. But his garage, with 22 service bays that include eight car lifts as well as a paint booth, draws an eclectic array of ambitious, cost-conscious wrenchers who frequently include millennials like Ms. Freeland.
The field is growing. Andrew Koretz owns Garagetime, where people can search for and book places to rent a garage or lift in their area.
"The younger generation," Mr. Koretz said, "is holding on to cars longer than ever, are tech-savvy, are inspired by what they see on DIY Network and used to being able to find cheap parts online and have them shipped to them for free in two days."
D.I.Y. car repair is obviously not a new concept. Beyond the perennial image of the dad under the hood of his car in his suburban driveway, The New York Times in 1978 reported on a "relatively recent phenomenon" in which oil companies like Shell and Mobil were testing the concept of leasing garage stalls and lifts to customers to do their own work. In most cases, customers sign waivers releasing the garage from liability should they be injured during their repairs.
But those efforts largely died out in the subsequent decades in part because cars became more durable, more affordable and, with all those electronic and computerized amenities, seemingly more complex.
"Parts and cars became easily replaceable in the 1980s and 1990s, so it was easier to buy another car or take out another lease than to take pride in taking care of your vehicle," Mr. Koretz said. "Now we're in a stage of society where we've moved away from the higher-consumption mentality.
"The average age of a car on the road in the U.S. today is a record 11.8 years," he added, "so people are keeping them and investing in them longer than ever."
Mr. Rabout and other latter-day D.I.Y. garage entrepreneurs saw the escalating cost of auto repairs and the reputation of some dishonest mechanics as an opportunity for a renaissance. Many military bases offer bay and lift space for amateurs to fix their vehicles, he noted, and he wondered if civilians would want that opportunity. Turns out they do, he said.
"People are tired of paying $ 100 an hour for a guy to hold their car for a week and work on it on the last day and call you up and say it's done," said Mr. Rabout, who charges $ 25 an hour or $ 125 a day for a bay. "People can bring their car here and work on it that day and save 60 or 80 percent on the repair costs.
"My goal is not to charge a lot, because I'm talking about the guys who can't afford to take it somewhere anyway."
Mr. Koretz said My Mechanics Place was among the nation's largest and most elaborate D.I.Y. auto repair centers. Garagetime lists about 50 locations in 14 states where garages or bays are available for rent, although many are simply underused bays in existing full-service repair shops or even residential garages where apartment dwellers can go to work indoors.
Mr. Koretz, in fact, said he had gotten the idea for the website while trying to do car repair work on the rooftop parking structure of a Whole Foods in Chicago in freezing weather and noticed with envy the many empty residential garages nearby.
At Mr. Rabaut's shop, Ms. Freeland is an outlier in the sheer ambition of her work, but the clientele ranges wildly.
Karl Vernon, 50, spent a few days there with a 2006 Winnebago replacing a leaky roof and cutting out accumulated mold and dry rot, reducing the cost of the repair from more than $ 10,000 in a shop to under $ 2,000.
Gjoka Lucaj, 44, frequently rents a stall and the paint booth to complete independent body repair jobs, which Mr. Rabaut encourages as Mr. Lucaj also offers free advice to other customers if he sees them struggling.
But the typical client is more often like Logan Kubin, 20, who popped in one Saturday to replace the exhaust pipe on his 2018 Subaru with "one that's a little more free-flowing to make it faster for racing."
"For about five years, I've always done everything under a shady tree in the backyard, lifting the car on ramps or gas cans, but I wanted to actually use a lift and I found this spot on Google," Mr. Kubin said. "It's hard to get the car high enough to get in the middle here, so putting this on the lift turned an all-day job into about a two-hour job."
Ms. Freeland said she welcomed advice and oversight from others and believes that with a little bit of guidance most people could do more auto repair on their own than they thought. But she also related a cautionary tale of an Audi owner who showed up to refill his transmission fluid.
"He had no idea what he was doing, and he just wandered around talking to people, asking them for help, and didn't get done what he came in to be done," she recalled. "The employees here did their best to help him, but he just had no idea what he was even trying to do. He ended up leaving and going to the dealership."

Interactions with journalists key to trial of ex-Obama White House lawyer

Texto completo: The trial of former Obama White House counsel Gregory B. Craig, accused of lying to the Justice Department about his work for the Ukrainian government, turns on the nature of his interactions with journalists, both sides agreed Thursday during opening statements in federal court in Washington.
At issue is Craig's work performed while with a leading law firm in Washington and arranged by GOP lobbyist and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was a political adviser to the Ukrainian president.
Craig, who was President Barack Obama's first White House counsel and special counsel for President Bill Clinton, was the first prominent Democratic figure to be charged in connection with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Craig, 74, is accused of misleading and withholding information from Justice Department officials seeking to determine whether he was required to register as a foreign agent. He pleaded not guilty to one count of making false statements to investigators and has called the case against him "unprecedented and unjustified."
The case is a high-profile test of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, once a near-dormant law that since 2017 has been invoked in more than 20 federal prosecutions aimed at combating foreign interference in U.S. politics. The law requires Americans to publicly register when they are paid to influence U.S. policy for foreign governments.
The trial will also provide a behind-the-scenes look at relationships in Washington among lobbyists, lawyers, public relations consultants and journalists.
The question for jurors is not whether Craig was required to register but whether he lied to Justice Department officials about alleged public relations work on behalf of Ukraine that would have triggered the registration requirement.
In 2012, Manafort helped arrange for Craig and his then-law firm - Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom - to be hired to write an independent report reviewing the jailing of a political rival of Manafort's client: Ukraine's then-president, Viktor Yanukovych.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston told jurors that Craig's role went beyond the report. He "participated in meetings about the media plan and executed part of it," she said. Craig personally dropped off an advance copy at the home of a New York Times reporter, she said, while displaying in the courtroom emails between the two.
Prosecutors contend Craig did not want to register, because he believed it could prevent him from reentering government service and because he feared having to disclose that Ukrainian businessman Viktor Pinchuk had paid the firm $4.15 million for the report, undermining perceptions of Skadden's independence.
Craig attorney William W. Taylor III countered Thursday that Craig was concerned the Ukrainian government was inaccurately portraying the firm's report and that Craig wanted to talk directly with journalists - not in coordination with the government but to set the record straight about his findings.
He delivered a copy to David Sanger, a veteran national security reporter at the New York Times whom he trusted and had known for years since their sons played baseball together, Taylor said. "He wasn't signing up to do some kind of whitewash," he said. "He did it precisely because he was concerned about his own reputation."
Craig's attorneys have said he is being singled out for conduct no one would have thought required registering under the act at the time. Taylor said Thursday that Craig signed on to work with Manafort in 2012 before people "knew what we now know" about Manafort.
As part of the special counsel's investigation, Manafort was convicted in Virginia for bank and tax fraud and in the District for conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The judge who sentenced Manafort, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, is presiding over Craig's trial.
Jurors are expected to hear from Craig's former law firm colleagues and Rick Gates, a former top deputy to Manafort. Gates pleaded guilty in February 2018 to charges of conspiracy and lying to the FBI, becoming one of the first targets to cooperate in Mueller's investigation. Gates is awaiting sentencing.

New law allows alleged Epstein rape victim to sue

Texto completo: Seizing on a legal opportunity that went into effect in New York today, a woman who alleges that Jeffrey Epstein raped her when she was a teenager filed a lawsuit against the late financier's estate, his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell and three unnamed women who worked for him.
The Child Victims Act opens a year-long window, beginning Wednesday, for adults who were sexually abused as children to bring lawsuits. Such litigation would previously have been barred by a statute of limitations that prevented victims from suing after age 23. The law is expected to bring forward a flood of cases against institutions such as the Boy Scouts, the state's Catholic diocese and other religious organizations.
And now, it has been used by an alleged victim of Epstein in an attempt to seek justice.
In a complaint filed on Wednesday, Jennifer Araoz claims that Epstein sexually assaulted her numerous times when she visited his Manhattan townhouse to give him massages when she was age 14 or 15, and that, in one instance, he raped her. She would not have been put in these circumstances, she alleges, had it not been for the efforts of Maxwell and her associates.
In the complaint, Araoz, 32, alleges that Maxwell "participated with and assisted Epstein in maintaining and protecting his sex-trafficking ring by hiring recruiters to bring him underage girls for sexual purposes, scheduling appointments for Epstein, as well as intimidating witnesses and ensuring that his behavior remained a secret.
In an op-ed for the New York Times published on Wednesday, Aaroz explained that she had been able to sue thanks to the Child Victims Act.
"It took me years to tell the people close to me what had happened, she wrote of her decision not to come forward sooner. "I was so intimidated by his insistence that I never speak a word of my visits to anyone. And like many survivors, I struggled with anxiety and shame for what I had experienced.
Though she expressed frustration that Epstein's death on Saturday meant she could not confront him directly in court, she still wanted her story told "to hold Epstein to account and also his recruiters, the workers on his payroll who knew what he was doing and the prominent people around him who helped conceal and perpetuate his sex-trafficking scheme.
Araoz may not be the only alleged victim of Epstein's who utilizes the Child Victims Act throughout the next year.
Jennifer Freeman of the Marsh Law firm told The Washington Post on Wednesday that she and her colleagues represented a handful of Epstein's alleged victims of sexual abuse, some of whom could stand to benefit from the new legal opportunity.
Her firm has not yet filed any lawsuits because Epstein's death leaves the future of the case uncertain, but Freeman called the Child Victims Act "a second chance for restorative justice.
Epstein died of an apparent suicide Saturday while in federal custody in New York City, after being charged with sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. His death has complicated his alleged victims' attempts to seek justice, as the initial case against him will be dismissed, leaving the next steps in the case remain unclear.
Prosecuting Epstein's co-conspirators remains one option, the Post reported this week. Attorney General William Barr on Monday warned that "any co-conspirators should not rest easy.
"This case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein, Barr said. "The victims deserve justice, and they will get it.
This development has put a spotlight on Ghislaine Maxwell, a socialite and close friend of the late financier's who some of Epstein's accusers allege played a key role in procuring young girls and keeping his secrets. Maxwell was already named in a 2015 defamation lawsuit brought by a different Epstein accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, which has led to the public release of thousands of pages of documents detailing Epstein's activities.
Araoz's lawsuit prominently implicates Maxwell, saying that her assault and rape stemmed from Maxwell's successful procurement efforts.
In the complaint filed Wednesday, Araoz alleges that a "recruiter hired by Maxwell repeatedly approached her when she was a 14-year-old freshman at a New York high school and took her to Epstein's residence. Araoz made repeated visits to the Upper East Side townhouse, in which Epstein would show her various rooms, point out his taxidermied trophies, and often gave her $300 in cash to "help her out. But about a month into these visits, the complaint says, Maxwell began contacting her directly to schedule appointments.
Lawyers said to be representing Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The complaint alleges what Araoz told NBC's Savannah Guthrie in July - that Maxwell was "100 percent recruiting for Epstein and that Araoz was a victim of these efforts. At her first visit to the house alone, court documents say that Epstein took Araoz to a massage room and told her, "In order to help you with your modeling career, I will need to see your body. He asked her to take off her top, and then to give him a massage, during which he began masturbating in front of her.
The complaint says that these incidents occurred on a weekly basis while she was a freshman and a sophomore in high school, and that she was paid $300 each time she gave Epstein a massage. He frequently groped and assaulted her during the sessions, Araoz claims, but she says she was fearful of him and did what she was told. When she was 15, the complaint says, he raped her.
During one massage, she said, Epstein told her to take off her underwear and climb on top of him.
"I said I didn't want to, and he, you know, very forcefully kind of brought me onto the table, Araoz told Guthrie of the 2002 incident. "I just did what he told me to do. I was really scared, and I was telling him to stop, please stop.
Epstein did not stop, she said.
"He raped me, Araoz told Guthrie. "Forcefully raped me, knew exactly what he was doing, and I don't think cared.

Texto completo: Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, said recently that, after the Mueller report, the paper has to shift the focus of its coverage from the Trump-Russia affair to the president's alleged racism.
"We built our newsroom to cover one story, and we did it truly well," Baquet said. "Now we have to regroup, and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story."
Baquet made the remarks at an employee town hall Monday. A recording was leaked to Slate, which published a transcript Thursday.
In the beginning of the Trump administration, the Times geared up to cover the Russia affair, Baquet explained. "Chapter 1 of the story of Donald Trump, not only for our newsroom but, frankly, for our readers, was: Did Donald Trump have untoward relationships with the Russians, and was there obstruction of justice? That was a really hard story, by the way, let's not forget that. We set ourselves up to cover that story. I'm going to say it. We won two Pulitzer Prizes covering that story. And I think we covered that story better than anybody else."
But then came the Mueller report, with special counsel Robert Mueller failing to establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to fix the 2016 election. "The day Bob Mueller walked off that witness stand, two things happened," Baquet continued. "Our readers who want Donald Trump to go away suddenly thought, 'Holy shit, Bob Mueller is not going to do it.' And Donald Trump got a little emboldened politically, I think. Because, you know, for obvious reasons. And I think that the story changed. A lot of the stuff we're talking about started to emerge like six or seven weeks ago. We're a little tiny bit flat-footed. I mean, that's what happens when a story looks a certain way for two years. Right?"
Baquet used the gentlest terms possible — "the story changed" — but the fact is, the conspiracy-coordination allegation the Times had devoted itself to pursuing turned out to be false. Beyond that, Democrats on Capitol Hill struggled to press an obstruction case against the president. The Trump-Russia hole came up dry.
Now, Baquet continued, "I think that we've got to change." The Times must "write more deeply about the country, race, and other divisions."
"I mean, the vision for coverage for the next two years is what I talked about earlier: How do we cover a guy who makes these kinds of remarks?" Baquet said. "How do we cover the world's reaction to him? How do we do that while continuing to cover his policies? How do we cover America, that's become so divided by Donald Trump?"
The town hall was spurred by angry reaction, both inside and outside the Times, to a headline that many on the Left faulted for being insufficiently anti-Trump. After the El Paso shootings, when the president denounced white supremacy, the Times published a page-one story with the heading, "Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism."
"I think one of the reasons people have such a problem with a headline like this ... is because they care so much," one staffer said to Baquet. "And they depend on the New York Times. They are depending on us to keep kicking down the doors and getting through, because they need that right now. It's a very scary time."
Baquet vowed a transition to a new "vision" for the paper for the next two years. "How do we grapple with all the stuff you all are talking about?" he said to the staffer. "How do we write about race in a thoughtful way, something we haven't done in a large way in a long time? That, to me, is the vision for coverage. You all are going to have to help us shape that vision. But I think that's what we're going to have to do for the rest of the next two years."
The headline controversy, it appears, was a preview of a new 2019-2020 New York Times. If Baquet follows through, the paper will spend the next two years, which just happen to be the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, building the Trump-is-a-racist narrative. (Baquet added, almost as an afterthought, that the Times will "continu[e] to cover his policies.")
The employee town hall was not intended to be public. But the Times is a news organization, and no one could be surprised that a recording of it leaked, possibly by Times employees who want to push Baquet in an even more anti-Trump direction. In any event, it's now public. And the results will play out for the next two years.

Texto completo: COLUMBUS - The Quality Rock & Roll Revue features soulful rock and roll songs from throughout Nick Lowe's career—including his biggest hits—as well as selections from two recent EPs recorded with Los Straitjackets. Los Straitjackets provide backup for Nick as well as perform a short segment of their own instrumental surf guitar twangers.
CAPA presents Nick Lowe's Quality Rock & Roll Revue starring Los Straitjackets at the Davidson Theatre (77 S. High St.) at 8 p.m. Sept. 24. Tickets are $35 and $40 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.
Lowe has made his mark as a producer (Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Pretenders, The Damned), a songwriter of at least three songs you know by heart, a short-lived pop star, and a long-term musicians' musician.
From 1995's "The Impossible Bird" to 2011's "The Old Magic," Lowe has turned out a fantastic string of albums, each one devised in his West London home and recorded with a core of musicians who possess the same veteran savvy. Lowe brings wit and understated excellence to every performance, leading Ben Ratliff of the New York Times to describe his live show as "elegant and nearly devastating."
His new four-song EP, "Tokyo Bay," features Los Straitjackets as his backing band.
Los Straitjackets are the leading practitioners of the lost art of instrumental guitar. With the music of the Ventures, The Shadows, and with Link Wray and Dick Dale as a jumping-off point, the band has taken their unique, high energy brand of original rock and roll around the world. Clad in their trademark Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling masks, the "Jackets" have delivered their trademark guitar licks to 16 albums, thousands of concerts, and dozens of films and TV shows.
Their most recent album, What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love & Los Straitjackets, consists of instrumental covers of Nick Lowe songs.

Hacking Attack in Bulgaria Raises Suspicion of Russian Meddling

Texto completo: SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Kristiyan Boikov was 14 years old and living in Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv, when his parents gave him his first computer as a gift. He was soon obsessed, teaching himself a variety of computer languages and then, like many of his friends, turning his focus to issues of network security.
The world of cryptography -- the tools used to keep information from being unintentionally exposed -- held a special appeal.
"There is so much you can learn," he said. "Endless possibilities."
Six years later, Mr. Boikov finds himself at the center of the largest hacking case in the nation's history, accused by prosecutors of stealing the personal data of nearly every working adult in the country from the National Revenue Agency and working to "create instability in the country."
He denies all the charges, and many people, including Western intelligence officials and security experts, have expressed doubts about the government's case, noting that whoever was responsible, the episode raised serious concerns about the state of the country's cybersecurity.
The hack was made public -- with the data leaked to news media organizations from an email bearing a Russian address -- just as Bulgaria was finalizing its purchase of eight new F-16s as part of an American-backed plan to replace the country's aging Soviet-era jets and bring its air force in line with NATO standards.
The deal, worth $ 1.25 billion -- the largest military procurement by post-Communist Bulgaria -- includes the jets, ammunition, equipment and pilot training. Six single-seat and two two-seat F-16s would be delivered by 2023.
In the immediate aftermath of the breach, Bulgaria's interior minister, Mladen Marinov, raised the prospect that Russia might have had a hand in the attack, given the timing.
"Organized criminal groups involved in cyberattacks usually seek financial profits, but political motives are possible," he told reporters. "One can make a guess here."
Several American officials who follow Russia closely say the hacking bears the hallmark of an operation by Russia's military intelligence service, the G.R.U., to include a financial and political influence campaign targeting key decision makers within Bulgaria's government. But United States spy agencies have not yet conclusively determined who carried out the attack.
Some Bulgarian analysts say Russia views Bulgaria's membership in NATO and the European Union as "a Trojan horse" that Moscow could use to exert influence over the two groups' collective decision-making to blunt initiatives that contradict Russian interests.
But such a scenario requires that Russia maintain a sufficient influence over Bulgaria's domestic and foreign policy.
Ognian Shentov, the director of the Center for the Study of Democracy, in Sofia, said Bulgaria had perhaps the closest relationship with Russia of any European Union member.
"We have always been halfway between the Visegrad countries and Russia," Mr. Shentov said, referring to an Eastern European group that includes the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
Russia's biggest lever in Bulgaria is in the energy sector, in which it controls 100 percent of the country's nuclear power, 100 percent of its natural gas and most of its fuel supply, Mr. Shentov said.
Moscow has not hesitated to use it. The first government of Prime Minister Boiko Borisov collapsed in 2013 after a spike in energy prices that led to widespread protests, which Mr. Shentov said had been fueled by Russia.
At the same time, there was pressure on the government to sign off on a moratorium on gas exploration by Western companies. After Mr. Borisov resigned and was then re-elected, the moratorium remained in place.
The recent hack, in which the data of about five million people was stolen, has renewed concerns about other ways Russia could exert its influence.
"While an enthusiastic member of NATO, Bulgaria has weak and porous cyberdefenses -- probably the worst in the alliance," said Adm. James G. Stavridis, a four-star former NATO military commander.
"Significant cybercriminal activity, including some sponsored by the Russian state, is rife," he added. "Any 'shield wall' is only as strong as the weakest barrier, and the linkages into NATO infrastructure via Bulgaria during exercises and deployments there are concerning."
State Department officials also acknowledge the seriousness of the hack -- regardless of who carried it out -- and said it represented "a wake-up call" for the Bulgarian government at a time when Washington and other NATO allies are seeking to counter what they call Russia's "malign influence."
Sitting in his lawyer's office in Sofia, the capital, for his first interview with a foreign reporter since his arrest, Mr. Boikov said the whole thing seemed a bit unreal.
"They threatened me and told me what my future would be like if I didn't confess," he said.
Ivan Todorov, the chief executive of the cybersecurity company where Mr. Boikov worked, the TAD Group, and another employee, Georgi Yankov, were also arrested and charged with cyberterrorism. All three deny any involvement.
Mr. Yankov, in an interview last week, said he had just gotten off the phone with a New York Times reporter when he was arrested.
"I am a sales guy," he said. "I don't even know the technical stuff."
He said he believed the government was angry that he had been speaking to the foreign news media and needed to show that it was taking action.
The prosecutor's office made public what it said was compelling evidence, including CCTV footage that it claims shows Mr. Boikov and Mr. Yankov discussing the hack.
Prosecutors also said they had obtained files from Mr. Boikov's computer that linked him to the attack. On Friday, they released what they said were incriminating text messages from the encrypted Telegram app and witness statements.
Lawyers for Mr. Boikov said they had no way to judge whether the government information had been manipulated or taken out of context.
The attack on the National Revenue Agency, the equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service, exposed how deeply flawed Bulgaria's cybersecurity infrastructure is.
The breach was made possible by one of the most basic tools in the hacker kit, something known as SQL Injection -- essentially, the attacker uses a login page to insert malicious code that allows access to data.
It is one of the most common forms of attack and one of the most easily defended against.
After the breach, however, the Bulgarian tax authority was forced to acknowledge that it had never performed even simple penetration testing.
Bozhidar Bozhanov, who worked as an adviser to the Bulgarian government on cybersecurity from 2015 to 2016, said that what was most frightening about the breach was how easy it was to pull off.
"The claim of the prime minister that this was some kind of wizard is ridiculous," he said. "This could be done by any script kiddie," he said, using a term for an unsophisticated hacker relying on widely available software.
He said that he did not believe Russia was involved, but that if a "script kiddie could do this," one could only imagine what could be done with the backing of Russia's intelligence services.
Now working at a cybersecurity start-up, Mr. Bozhanov said that government institutions in Bulgaria have not taken even the most modest of measures to protect data.
"This breach was kind of inevitable," he said. The government, he said, simply did not have people with the needed expertise and could not compete with the country's booming private IT industry.
Rosen Bachvarov, a spokesman for the National Revenue Agency, said the agency had been flooded with around 5,000 calls every day from anxious citizens. A website allowing people to check whether their data was stolen has been used 1.2 million times, and a list of suggestions is being prepared for those whose data was stolen.
"We are now mainly interested in dealing with the consequences of the breach," he said.
Those consequences remain hard to quantify.
Data stolen in other breaches typically finds its way onto the so-called dark web -- a corner of the internet that can be visited anonymously with special browsers -- limiting the exposure.
But the Bulgarians' data was leaked to the news media, and links to where it could be found were published online. Much of the stolen information is only a quick internet search away.
"The obvious lesson learned is we have to reconsider how we protect information," Mr. Bachvarov said. "Not just at this agency, but across the government."

Texto completo: RECENTLY India took the unprecedented step to strip the Muslim majority state of Kashmir of its special status as guaranteed in the Indian Constitution.

The root of the dispute between India and Pakistan goes back to 1947 when Indian Subcontinent was partitioned into a predominantly Muslim Pakistan and a majority Hindu India. Pakistan claims Kashmir because it is a majority Muslim area and is geographically contiguous with Pakistan. India claims Kashmir because the ruler of Kashmir opted to join India after the partition. In the past there have been many attempts at mediation by the United Nations and countless talks between the two countries. Nothing has broken the deadlock including two costly and bloody wars they fought in 1948 and 1965. The Kashmir dispute took on an added urgency when India and Pakistan went nuclear.

Historians also blame Lord Mountbatten the last viceroy of united India and after independence the first governor general of India for masterminding the accession of Kashmir to India.

Kashmir is a police state where India has positioned half a million soldiers to control a population of 8 million Kashmiris living in the valley. The soldiers have blanket immunity from prosecution for flagrant human rights abuses. There have been plenty of human rights violations documented by international Human Rights Watch and U.N. High Commission for Human Rights.

In the past 30 years in excess of 94,000 Kashmiris have died at the hands of Indian soldiers. There have been more than 10,000 people disappeared and a similar number of women raped.

India blames Pakistan, with some justification, for the unrest that had gripped the region off and on for the better part of 70 years. However it will be foolhardy to believe that another country can sustain an insurgency without the support of the local population. And that population has categorically rejected Indian claim over their homeland. And they also reject the idea of joining Pakistan. They want independence.

On the pretext of an impending terrorist attack by Pakistan, the Modi government pulled out all foreigners and non-Kashmiri Indian citizens from Kashmir including reporters and correspondents. It imposed a complete curfew over the Valley and cut off all means of communication including television, cell phones and landlines. Then it announced the revoking the article of the constitution that gave Kashmir a special status.

Thousands of Kashmiris were rounded up including Kashmiri leaders. One veteran leader Farooq Abdullah, a three time chief minister of Kashmir and currently a member of Indian parliament, was imprisoned in his home in Srinagar and not allowed to go to New Delhi to take part in the current session of the parliament.

Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi's landslide victory in the recent general election was driven by his unabashed Hindu nationalism and his between- the-lines anti-Muslim rhetoric. It is amazing that there is but one Muslim minister in his cabinet of 57 ministers. There are 200 million Muslims in India constituting 15 percent of the population.

It is interesting that India, while taking such a drastic action and ostensibly helping the Kashmiris, did not consult Kashmiri leaders. There has not been a representative government in the state for some time.

Last Friday the curfew was relaxed for few hours in order for people to attend Friday services. After services 10,000 people gathered to demonstrate against the total shut down and house imprisonment of 8 million people. The police, as had been done previously, have used tear gas and pellet guns to disperse the crowd. Many people were injured and taken to hospitals particularly with pellet injuries to the eyes. The New York Times had in the past called the practice of using pellet guns an epidemic of blindness in the valley.

Most experts agree that the sole purpose of this change in the status of Kashmir is gentrification of the Valley. It would allow Hindu nationalists to buy land in Kashmir and change the demographics. If it were to curb militancy and terrorism, then Mr. Modi has to dispense off the entire Muslim population of Kashmir.

According to a former chief minister of Kashmir, Mahbooba Mufti, by removing the special status of Kashmir, India has declared itself as a foreign country occupying an independent people. She compared the current occupation by Indian forces to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza.

Perhaps it is not coincidental that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to visit India in the very near future.

Glenn Thrush kept book advance after #MeToo allegations, Maggie Haberman had to give hers back

Texto completo: New York Times White House reporter Maggie Haberman is literally paying the price for sexual misconduct allegations against her colleague Glenn Thrush.
The two inked a deal in late 2017 to write a book on the Trump presidency for Random House. Thrush was then accused of sexual misconduct by four women, suspended from covering the White House for the New York Times, and dropped from the book project.
Thrush got to keep his portion of the book advance because Random House axed him from the deal. Thrush was reassigned to a new beat covering poverty, and recently was promoted to a senior role on the political investigation’s team.
Haberman, however, tried to move forward with the project but ultimately decided not to finish the book. She had to pay back her portion of the book advance to the publisher, BuzzFeed News reported Wednesday.
It remains unclear how big the advance was, but it was rumored to be huge, given the two reporters delivered scoop after scoop on the Trump administration.

Our most popular logical fallacy

Texto completo: Most people seem to believe that the “ad hominem” argument is America’s most appealing fallacy. It’s frequently cited and gives people a chance to show off the only Latin phrase they know. It’s an argument against a position or opinion that attacks the person, not his reasoning or evidence. For example: “Adolf Hitler’s racial theories were a crock of cracked pot shards because he was a vegetarian who committed genocide. This, we note is not a false statement. It is a true statement but it is not a logical refutation of the man’s deranged ideas.
It proposes that “post hoc ergo propter hoc” (literally, “after this therefore because of this”) is far more popular, even though few people have heard its name. It implies that because one thing occurred after another, it must have occurred as a result of it. Reasoning thus, a simpleton might conclude that a cat must cause the dog that chases it. Moving up several cognitive notches this fallacy produces the very common error of confusing correlation with causation. This is so common that I suspect I must have committed it myself, and more than once. (NB: “suspect”—I admit nothing…)
Here’s an example which should make the post hoc, propter hoc problem clearer. The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service has compiled accurate figures for American margarine consumption between 2000 and 2009. The U.S. National Center for Health Services, National Vital Statistics Reports on Births, Marriages, Divorces and Deaths in Maine during the same period with the same accuracy. Plot the margarine consumption and Maine’s divorce rates together on the same graph and you will find a 98.9% correlation. If you were unaware of the logical fallacy (or were otherwise dim-witted) you might conclude that a reduction in margarine production would reduce the divorce rate in our state.
Tyler Vigen’s “Spurious Correlations,” loaned to me by my younger sister, is full of similar graphs. I must emphasize that the correlations are not really spurious. It’s the supposed conclusions that are spurious.
We have suddenly been seeing a national epidemic of this fallacy. President Trump, the most verbose if not the most eloquent American president of recent memory, gassing away with his usual volubility during last year’s midterm elections warned that America was under attack by immigrants heading for our southern borders. “You look at what is marching up, that is an invasion!” he declared at one rally. “That is an invasion!” Nine months later a “suspect” who killed 20 people at an El Paso Walmart was found to have written a manifesto declaring that his attack was a response “to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” It’s true that his manifesto declared that his invasion fears predated Trump’s assertion, but a New York Times analysis argues that “if Mr. Trump did not originally inspire the gunman, he brought into the mainstream polarizing ideas and people once consigned to the fringes of American society.”
The Times’s “analysis” echoes the condemnations trumpeted by politicians desperate for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. The echoing will continue at least until the 2020 general election and may continue with diminishing fervor thereafter. We would commit the post hoc fallacy if we argued that the Times was inspired by the candidates. This is not true. Left-lurching pundits and the Democratic candidates belong to the same herd and a common herd instinct guides them all. They need no orchestration and inspiration from each other. Other members of the herd, including people writing letters to the editor in your local newspaper, will pick up the call. The Times “analysis” is built around that single word, “invasion.” The authors elaborate their attacks with the assertions that the man they hate has filled his public speeches and Twitter feeds with “sometimes false, fear-stroking language even as he welcomed to the White House a corps of hard-liners, demonizers and conspiracy theorists shunned by past presidents of both parties.”
This elaboration relies almost entirely on inferences and vague generalities. Some members of this alleged corps are named, but no information about their exact view is supplied. The hard core of the accusations is the word invasion. Trump used that word. The “suspect” used that same word. Case closed. Verdict, guilty. No one is claiming that America’s supreme Twitter-babbler has explicitly advocated violence. Why bother? That pitiless word is enough.
This single example is intended to serve as a general warning. This popular fallacy will proliferate, and proliferate some more, during this period of boiling hot political antagonisms. Although I naturally prefer to belabor examples emanating from the left, I have to admit that you will see some from my side.

Manage -- even conquer! -- your cilantro hatred

Texto completo: Among the many questions about substitutions and recipe changes readers pose, one of the most common ingredients that trips people up is cilantro.
"This is one herb you either like or dislike -- there seems to be no middle road," writes British author, grower and gardening expert Jekka McVicar in her book, "Jekka's Herb Cookbook."
To say people dislike cilantro seems like one of those charming English understatements, because often the sentiment that arises is more like loathing. "Has A Nation Taken Leaf of Its Senses?" screamed an over-the-top Washington Post article from 1994, in which author Elizabeth Kastor calls cilantro "an affront" that "tastes like the grief you feel over the public humiliation of a favorite teacher who was found drinking in the language lab."
OK then!
Often, however, people describe the taste of cilantro as soapy. As Harold McGee explained in The New York Times some years back, that comparison makes sense given that cilantro's aroma shares some of its flavor substances with soap. McVicar also mentions the scent "is said to resemble a crushed bedbug," which was a new one for me (shudder). Then again, McGee cites the "Oxford Companion to Food" when he explains that the word coriander, another name for cilantro, "is said to derive from the Greek word for bedbug." Anyway, whether that soapy/bug taste is the result of some kind of genetic factor or merely a result of your environment (cilantro is a lot more integral to some cuisines than others) is almost beside the point when someone who can't stand it is confronted by it.
"It's one of those flavors you can distinctly pick out of any dish," says Bill Williamson, executive chef at Washington's BLT Prime, who admits to being able to tolerate cilantro only some of the time. Given his job, he's used to working around people who claim a sensitivity or allergy to the herb. Here's some advice from him and others if you're in the same boat.
Leave it off. Honestly, it's sometimes as simple as that. If the recipe is merely using cilantro as a garnish, you're not going to make or break the dish by skipping it. Or set aside a separate bowl to let your guests add as much or as little of it as they want to.
Make a substitution. At the restaurant, Williamson says, the kitchen often swaps in a mix of parsley, tarragon and dill for cilantro. And because cilantro lends a bright, citrusy pop of flavor, lime or lemon zest is another option. He also likes carrot tops. "It's kind of a warm, earthy, sweeter spicy flavor," he says of the greens, which can otherwise go to waste. Depending on the dish, you may also be able to get away with mint or basil. Real Simple recommends Thai basil, which is a great idea I wish I had thought of, because it has a sharp pungency similar to cilantro.
Try a different form. Coriander seeds are from the cilantro plant, so Williamson says you can try them instead. Some people might find them more palatable. McVicar says the seeds even "develop a delightful orangelike scent." If you can get your hands on it, micro cilantro is also worth a shot because it's less potent than the full-size plant, Williamson says.
Get used to it! If you're interested in seeing whether you can get over your cilantro aversion, it's certainly possible. Just ask the neuroscientist in McGee's piece, who also happens to be an expert in smell. McGee notes that crushing cilantro may help eliminate its more soapy aroma substances. He's also a fan of cilantro pesto, which he calls "lotion-free and surprisingly mild." Similarly, I think a good Indian chutney is another great way to go. "If you can surround yourself with likable dishes," Williamson says, "maybe you can kind of change your attitude toward the actual herb itself."

"I aim for a mix that includes something urgent, something funny, something surprising and something that introduces readers to a new perspective."
-- Rachel Dry , New York Times deputy politics editor, on how she thinks about a successful story mix.
______
Last week, we introduced the Elevator Interview -- a summer series showcasing the voices of Times writers and editors, as conducted through rapid-fire inside our very slow corporate elevators.
This week, our elevators were broken. So we caught up with Rachel Dry, our deputy politics editor, by email.
In Her Words: You're editing politics in a tumultuous moment. How do you start your mornings on the right foot? And how do you wind down at the end of the day?
I like to do yoga in the mornings. Recently, I've been going to a hot yoga class where I am the only woman in the room wearing a plus-size T-shirt. Well, usually I am the only woman wearing any kind of shirt at all. Everyone else is in just a bra. It gives me the same general boost of confidence that I got from being a very mediocre competitive swimmer for 10+ years as a kid. The feeling of: Yes, I know I don't look like everyone else who has elected to do this activity, but I am here too.
(I should note for the record that I was, I believe, the 13th fastest 10-year-old in the state of Vermont to swim 25 yards of butterfly in the summer of 1993, with a neon pink ribbon to prove it. I wasn't, however, what anyone would describe as a natural athlete.)
Did that self-deprecating aside about my childhood distract from the fact that my answer to the first part of this question was "yoga"? I sincerely hope that it did!
At night, I do this thing where every email I forgot to send during the day flits across my consciousness and I write a shorthand list of guilt in a note on my phone. Then I move my phone to a different room. Then I get out of bed and write more things in that note. Then winding down. Just one woman's foolproof technique.
You recently left your post as editor of Sunday Review, where you worked with writers like Roxane Gay and Lindy West, to become a deputy editor on politics. How are you hoping to shape our coverage as we head into 2020?
One appealing aspect to taking this new role was thinking about the audience we're trying to reach: The people who have, since Nov. 9, 2016, made politics their social life/religion/main topic of conversation -- and the people who have tuned it all out. It's important (for The Times and, I would argue, for the country) that we figure how to engage as many people in both of those groups as possible. And, especially for a features editor, that is an exciting challenge. Because it means experimenting.
When I was editing Sunday Review, I tried for each issue to have at least one story in these categories: something urgent, something funny, something surprising and something that introduced readers to a new voice or perspective. Editing political stories is different from a weekly section of course. But I think aiming toward that general mix is a useful aspiration for keeping readers engaged and for adding breadth to the kinds of stories we tell.
Do you ever face self- doubt ?
Recently, I spent most of the day hanging out with a friend's 5-year-old. We did a lot of playing: the throwing-the-stuffed-animals-into-the-air game, the pretend-sleeping-with-very-loud-snoring game, the this-fort-will-protect-us-from-dinosaurs game -- all the hits. At one point, she looked at me, genuinely confused, and said: "Wait. Are you a grown up?" This was a very affirming encounter. So I guess at low moments I like to either FaceTime my 5-year-old friend and make her tell me how much fun I am or, in a pinch, force people to listen to this story.
In addition to editing, you do standup comedy. Does comedy help with your day job?
I have a joke in my act about a diary I kept in junior high. Once, I decided to add a few extra lines about how much I loved Jane Austen. Just a totally unnecessary aside about what "Persuasion" meant to 13-year-old me. It bombed. There is nothing quite as clarifying as a silent crowd. Especially if people had previously been laughing and are now telling you, through not responding verbally in any way, that your joke was self-indulgent.
Performing is a particularly good reminder to edit everything down to the essentials. Make sure that the joke, the quote, the aside, the scene, the extended reference to 19th-century British literature are all there for the reader/audience, not for you. This is not to say that stories can't be 5,000 words long and individual jokes should never go on for 15 minutes. You just have to make sure that people will come with you.

What else is happening
Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed.

From the archives, 1968: Help Wanted -- Female
Fifty-one years ago this week, in 1968, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that segregating male and female help-wanted ads violated the Civil Rights Act.
A few months later, The Times, along with other New York publications, announced it would change its jobs ads from "Help Wanted -- Female" and "Help Wanted -- Male" to simply "Help Wanted."

Texto completo: Along with heightened pressure to stop selling firearms after a mass shooting at a store in El Paso, Texas, the retail giant Walmart is contending with criticism over pro-gun T-shirts sold on its website by third-party vendors.
At least one shirt, from Tee’s Plus, appears to have been removed from Walmart.com after widespread condemnation on social media. The t-shirt features a list with the words “gun owner” and “victim,” with a box checked next to “gun owner.”
New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin tweeted an image of the shirt and wrote of Walmart, “You really sell this T-shirt on your website?”TweetAuthor Kurt Eichenwald also lambasted Walmart for selling the T-shirt, tweeting, “Beyond comment. @Walmart finds problems with signs for video games. But not guns. And not this.”TweetA Walmart spokesman said the company has "a policy that prohibits merchandise glorifying violence, and we’re continually reviewing our assortment to remove items as needed.”
While the Tee’s Plus shirt appears to have been taken from Walmart’s website, other pro-gun apparel remains available, though it's sold by third-party vendors who are responsible for pricing and fulfillment. The retailer collects payments on behalf of the vendors and deducts a "referral fee" before turning the cash over to them.
A shirt listed on Walmart.com and offered by Old Glory reads “Gun control is being able to hit your target,” and another one says “I plead the Second” and includes an image of a firearm. A third features the quote “Gun control requires concentration and a steady hand.”
Other gun-related shirts are available on websites such as Amazon, which lists hundreds of pro-gun options that riff on issues including illegal immigration and abortion rights.
Walmart is grappling with concerns from both shoppers and workers after the El Paso shooting, which occurred when a gunman opened fire on Aug. 3, killing 22 people and injuring more than two dozen. Patrick Crusius, 21, was arrested in the attack, which came just days after a disgruntled Walmart employee in Mississippi was charged with shooting two other associates to death.
Following the El Paso shooting, a man armed with tactical weapons and ammunition showed up at a Walmart store in Missouri, but was detained by an off-duty fireman until police arrived and took him into custody.
Walmart stopped selling assault-style rifles in 2015 and doesn't sell handguns, but the massacre in Texas led to calls for the retailer to pull out of the firearms business altogether. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said last week it has not changed its policy, though it did raise the minimum age to purchase guns and ammunition to 21 last year after a gunman killed 17 at a high school in Parkland, Florida.
Walmart last week ordered employees “to remove any violent marketing material, unplug Xbox and PlayStation consoles that show violent video games and turn off any violence depicted on screens in its electronics departments.”

Trump's new immigration rule exposes the current system as a global welfare scheme

Texto completo: Has anyone checked to see if CNN’s Dana Bash still has a job after accurately reporting on the Trump administration’s new immigration rule?
The White House announced Monday that it was instituting an awaited rule that bars immigrants from legal permanent residency in the U.S. if they need or are likely to need welfare assistance. On Tuesday, Bash was able to calmly and precisely describe the purpose of the new rule, even while looking back at the pack of wolves sweet guests who joined her on the panel.
“The president has said he wants to move the legal immigration system to a merit-based system,” Bash said on New Day. “What he means by that is people who can come and have money, people who can come and live without needing the assistance of the U.S. government.”
Wow, a normal person might say to themselves, do we really bring in hundreds of thousands of foreigners each year needing millions of dollars in food and housing assistance courtesy of the American taxpayer?
Why yes, normal person. Yes, we do.
You could almost hear CNN viewers around the country holding their breath to see if Bash would be dragged off set by her hair for not doing the standard CNN thing when discussing any new Trump proposal, which is for the correspondent to knit their eyebrows, look solemnly at the camera and question whether America’s moral fabric can survive yet another assault.
Not to worry, though. Bianna Golodryga and John Avlon were there to show Bash how it’s done.
Golodryga said it was “absurd” to put a standard in place that says “people can’t just come and rely on our safety net.”
Avlon took a page out of his colleague Jim Acosta’s book and cited the poem on the Statue of Liberty, as though the monument were a governing text rather than a French import that requires tens of thousands of tax dollars each day to remain operational (just like most of our new immigrant arrivals!)
“What this new policy does,” said Avlon, “is say, [get the f--- out].”
Minor correction: What the new policy says is, if you’re an immigrant unable to contribute to American society rather than suck it dry of its resources, then GTFO.
Nothing exposes the Democratic Party’s and the national media’s position on immigration like their fire-breathing defense of any and every poor person’s right to come to the U.S.
They have no such right — unless they jump with children across the Rio Grande into Texas and claim asylum, and then yes, they have that right. (Thanks, Democrats!) Otherwise, entry into the U.S. should be the greatest privilege the Earth has ever seen.
The administration didn’t even do something fun, like announce the new rule without warning. It doesn’t take effect until mid-October, and it was first floated almost exactly a year ago. At that time, Democrats and the national media misled and lied about its purpose. Back then, the New York Times rebutted the idea of immigrants on welfare with the completely unrelated assertion that legal immigration “has led to higher, not lower, wages.”
Setting aside that other “studies” say the opposite, the new guidelines have nothing to do with wages and everything to do with immigrants who come to the U.S. and are immediately loaded up on welfare, like food assistance, Medicaid, and housing, vacuuming up resources that might otherwise go to the poor people already here.
The authors of a 2017 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine believed more immigration to be a good thing — and yet still found that nearly 60% of noncitizen, non-naturalized, immigrant-led households used some kind of welfare from 2011-2013. That’s compared to just 42% of homes led by native-born citizens.
A 2015 study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates restricting immigration, found basically the same thing only looking at data for 2012. The study said that immigrant-led households consumed double the Medicaid and food assistance benefits that native ones did. Overall, 51% of immigrant-led homes used “any welfare,” compared to 30% for native homes.
Liberals will of course get ready to lie again about the administration’s new rule. Late last year, the Center for American Progress published a study claiming that immigrants soak up little, if any welfare at all!
“The truth is … that most of the people who would be denied green cards and other visas under the revised [rule] have never received any public benefits in the United States,” the organization said, waving a shiny object with its left hand. And then using its right hand, it stole your purse: “The potential future receipt of supplemental in-kind benefits … including Medicaid, [food stamps], and rental housing assistance — does not make someone a public charge under long-standing policy and practice.”
Ah-ha! So because “long-standing policy and practice” haven’t considered certain forms of welfare to be real welfare, taxpayers are supposed to ignore them and shrug as if they’re not a drain on society. But they are a drain, and every taxpayer should be mad about it.
The John Avlons and the Bianna Golodrygas are here to tell you that your money should go to an endless flow of poor people who want in to the U.S. Have a heart!
We apparently don’t already have enough of our own poor people to deal with. Is there anyone on CNN to argue on their behalf?

Nadler and Collins launch bipartisan probe of suicide

Texto completo: The top Democrat and Republican on the House committee with oversight of U.S. prisons are asking the same question everybody else is: How the hell was accused pedophile Jeffrey Epstein allowed to kill himself while in federal custody?
U.S. Reps. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Doug Collins (R-Ga.) co-signed a letter Monday evening to Hugh Hurwitz, the acting director of the federal Bureau of Prisons, asking for answers to that question.
Epstein was found hanged in his cell at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center downtown on Saturday morning.
"The apparent suicide of this high-profile and - if allegations are proven to be accurate - particularly reprehensible individual while in the federal government's custody demonstrates severe miscarriages of, or deficiencies in, inmate protocol and has allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice," Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler (photo) and ranking Republican Collins said in the letter.
"Any victims of Mr. Epstein's actions will forever be denied proper recourse and the scintilla of recompense our justice system can provide in the face of such alleged atrocities," they added. "The competency and rigor of our criminal justice system has been marred by this apparent oversight."
The committee chiefs listed 23 questions relating to the Bureau of Prison's suicide prevention policies, and how they were implemented in the case of Epstein. They particularly quizzed Hurwitz about revelations that Epstein had been on suicide watch for some of his time behind bars, how that suicide watch was ended, and how Epstein was evaluated.
They also asked how Epstein had been housed, the staffing level, how often he was checked and whether there was video surveillance. Nadler and Collins said they wanted access to any and all documents and records that could answer their questions and gave Hurwitz until Aug. 21 to respond.
The Bureau of Prisons did not return requests for comment late Monday.
Attorney General William Barr - who's Hurwitz's de facto boss as the nation's top law enforcement official - had signaled earlier in the day that the Justice Department was already all over the Epstein case.
"I was appalled - indeed the whole department was - and frankly angry, to learn of the MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation," Barr said at a conference in New Orleans, affirming the Justice Department's inspector general as well as the FBI are investigating Epstein's death.
The AG did not get into details, but The New York Times reported later Monday that one of the two people who had guarded Epstein before his apparent suicide was not "a full-fledged correctional officer." Epstein also had reportedly not been checked on for several hours before his body was discovered.
The internet has erupted with conspiracy theories over Epstein's death. The billionaire financier was well known to have connections to the rich and powerful around the world, and he's been linked to leaders such President Trump and Bill Clinton.
No evidence has emerged that the death of Epstein is anything other than a suicide.
Having a bipartisan inquiry could alleviate some of the political rumor-mongering. Several of the questions posed by Nadler and Collins seemed designed to dispel claims that there could have been outside meddling.
"If, as you have stated, Mr. Epstein died of an apparent suicide, what are the facts and circumstances that led you to make that determination, and please provide a copy of the report of the autopsy which was subsequently performed," they wrote.

Suicide perfect storm; No cellmate, no checks &amp; lift of alert let Ep slip away

Texto completo: Accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center - three weeks after a flubbed attempt - may have been the perfect storm of poor prison practices, inadequate staffing and a bad medical call.
Guards didn't follow procedure in the hours before the disgraced financier was found dead Saturday, including the directive that he have a cellmate and that a guard "look into his cell" every 30 minutes, The New York Times reported.
According to the paper, the federal jail had transferred Epstein's inmate, leaving him alone in the cell two weeks after he was removed from suicide watch.
It's standard procedure at the downtown lockup to house people who have been on suicide watch with a cellmate. It's also standard procedure for guards in special housing units, like the one where Epstein was located, to check inmates every half hour, Bureau of Prisons officials told The Times.
There are also vexing questions about why Epstein was taken off suicide watch - and who made the call.
Christine Tartaro, who wrote a book about suicide and self-harm in jails, told the Daily News that while policy differs from facility to facility, most have written guidelines for taking inmates off suicide watch and said, "People should never come off of suicide watch unless a qualified mental health professional has had the opportunity to assess them and make that call."
She said she believes most facilities have a mental health expert make that call, though that person could be a psychologist, rather than a psychiatrist, meaning they wouldn't have a medical degree.
According to the Times report, Epstein was getting daily psychiatric evaluations while on suicide watch.
The Bureau of Prisons has a long history of inadequate mental health care, including shortages of psychiatrists on staff, Deborah Golden, a lawyer at the Human Rights Defense Center told the Miami Herald.
"They do a bad job at suicide prevention," Golden said. "They don't have a humane system for monitoring someone. It's considered more like a disciplinary infraction: attempting self-harm."
Originally placed on suicide watch following his first attempt on July 10, the 66-year-old Epstein was taken off the restriction for reasons that haven't been publicly explained. Barely two weeks after that he was found dead after apparently hanging himself.
The jail was also short-staffed at the time of Epstein's suicide.
One guard in Epstein's unit was working a fifth straight day of overtime and another guard was working mandatory overtime, The Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed source.
But Preet Bharara, the former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said Epstein's suicide was likely recorded by jail cameras.
"One hopes it is complete, conclusive, and secured," he tweeted.
Epstein previously complained about conditions in his cell, where he "lived like a pig in a sty," the Daily Beast reported. The news outlet's source said Epstein ate his meals off the floor at the Metropolitan Correction Center and repeatedly asked for more toilet paper.
With speculation swirling about the circumstances surrounding his suicide, Twitter exploded with harebrained conspiracy theories, including baseless speculation that Epstein was killed in order to stifle information about high-profile individuals involved in his sex ring.
President Trump, who knew Epstein for years, joined in by sharing a Tweet and video from conservative comedian Terrence Williams claiming that Bill and Hillary Clinton were involved in Epstein's death.
In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway downplayed Trump's dabbling in the conspiracy theory mania.
"I think the president just wants everything to be investigated," she said. "There was some unsealed information implicating some people very high up."
Meanwhile, rubberneckers on Sunday milled around Epstein's massive limestone townhouse on the Upper East Side, where someone had scrawled three hearts and the message, "XOXOXO HILLARY and BILL CLINTON," in light blue chalk at the foot of the door.
There was little sympathy among neighbors.
A 60-year-old baby-sitter in the neighborhood who only gave her name as Marena said she's seen Epstein walking in the area.
"I feel sad for the girls," she said. "There is no justice. He didn't pay."
A retired schoolteacher who lives in Queens had a friend snap a photograph of him with the stately mansion in the background. "We want to know who did it," said the 74-year-old man, who would only identify himself as Ralph.
He said he didn't buy the news that Epstein committed suicide. "You could name a lot of people. The rich are too powerful," he said.
As the legal focus shifts from Epstein to his co-conspirators and estate in the wake of his death, those in his orbit have lawyered up, according to The Times.
In addition to two of Epstein's longtime lawyers, Darren Indyke and Jeffrey Schantz, hiring criminal defense attorneys, clothing retailer L Brands, whose CEO Leslie Wexner had close financial ties to Epstein for years, has launched a legal probe into the role Epstein played at the company.
A lawyer for some of Epstein's alleged victims isn't giving up.
"On behalf of the victims I represent, we would have preferred he lived to face justice," civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom tweeted Saturday. "Our civil cases can still proceed against his estate. Victims deserve to be made whole for the lifelong damage he caused."
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman issued a statement confirming Epstein's death did not end the federal probe.
"We remain committed to standing for (the victims), and our investigation of the conduct charged ... remains ongoing," he said.
On Friday, one day before Epstein's death, hundreds of pages of unsealed documents were released in Manhattan Federal Court, including alleged links to prominent politicians and socialites with knowledge of his sex trafficking ring.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential primary front-runner Joe Biden penned an op-ed in the New York Times on Monday, calling military-style firearms a threat to America's national security and pledging to ban them if he's elected president in 2020.
"We have a huge problem with guns," Biden wrote. "Assault weapons — military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly — are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such."
The former vice president cited his work on the 1994 crime bill that banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for 10 years, legislation seen today as controversial for its effect on minority communities and contributing to the militarization of police in America.
Biden vowed to stop gun manufacturers from "circumventing the law" by making minor modifications to their products and introduce a gun buyback program to get as many assault weapons "off our streets as possible as quickly as possible."
He lamented that shortly after the 1994 legislation passed, the National Rifle Association and the pro-gun lobby in Washington, D.C. put Republican lawmakers "in a headlock."
"Republican leaders try to prevent action and parrot NRA. messaging — as Donald Trump did last week when he said, 'mental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,'" Biden said. "This is the same president who during his first year in office repealed a rule President Barack Obama and I put in place to help keep guns out of the hands of people with certain mental illnesses.This is the same president who said after Charlottesville that there were 'very fine people on both sides,' and who continues to fan the flames of hate and white supremacy. We can’t trust his diagnosis."
A racist attack by a gunman in El Paso that left nearly two dozen people dead last week has reignited a debate about Trump's anti-illegal immigration rhetoric, a focal point of Biden's attacks on Trump in the early going of the primary election.
It was the just the latest mass shooting in America, where nearly 1,200 people have died in similar attacks over the last half-century, according to the Washington Post.
Racist domestic terrorists inspired by ballooning political tensions with access to deadly weapons is a recipe for disaster, Biden warned.
"It’s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs, that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run, and that families everywhere experience increasing anxiety that they are simply not safe anywhere in the United States," he said. "We have to get these weapons of war off our streets."

Texto completo: New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet admitted to staffers during a Monday newsroom meeting that the recent debacle about a changed headline was a "f--king mess."
Regarding a presidential speech made in the wake of recent mass shootings, the original headline for the paper's print edition read “TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM." The framing sparked backlash online and even earned condemnation from Democratic presidential candidates.
The Times then changed the headline to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
TweetTweetTweet
The Daily Beast reported Baquet also urged staffers not to overreact to Twitter comments about the paper’s editorial decision and warned against giving online mobs too much sway.
Of the editor who penned the first headline, Baquet said, “He’s sick. He feels terrible.”
The meeting also briefly mentioned the online behavior of Times deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman, whose tweets have caused a lot of outrage in the newsroom.
“The thing that surprised me was that the Jonathan Weisman issue didn’t come up more, because it has had the newsroom in absolute meltdown for the past week,” one Times staffer said. “I think the big question that people have right now is, ‘Is this guy going to get suspended?’ What’s going to happen to him? It’s a really big deal.”
“He’d already been told to shut the f--k up on Twitter," the person added.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jail staff failed to follow protocols leading up to Jeffrey Epstein's death as the fallout from the highly connected financier's apparent suicide deepened, according to a report from The New York Times.
Epstein should have been checked on by guards in his cell every 30 minutes, but that didn't happen the night before his apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told the Times.
The Times spoke to the official on the condition of anonymity. The Associated Press has not independently confirmed the information.
A law enforcement source also said he was alone in his cell Saturday night after his cellmate was transferred. An official with knowledge of the investigation told the Times that the Justice Department was told Epstein would have a cellmate and be monitored by a guard every 30 minutes.
The mystery surrounding how he was able to kill himself in jail comes as investigators have been digging into allegations of sexual abuse and conspiracy against Epstein . An additional federal investigation was launched Saturday after the Federal Bureau of Prison said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at a high-security jail in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead from an apparent suicide, the BOP said. His abrupt death cuts short a criminal prosecution that could have pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of the high-flying financier with connections to celebrities and presidents , though prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating.
Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found a little over two weeks ago with bruising on his neck, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. But he was taken off the watch at the end of July and therefore wasn't on it at the time of his death, the person said.
Attorney General William Barr, calling for an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, said he was "appalled to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody.
"Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered, Barr said in a statement.
Epstein, 66, had been denied bail and faced up to 45 years behind bars on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges unsealed last month. He had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial.
The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said. He noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case.
Epstein's death raises questions about how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates. In October, Boston gangster James "Whitey Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred.
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Saturday in a scathing letter to Barr that "heads must roll after the incident.
"Every single person in the Justice Department - from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer - knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him, Sasse wrote.
Epstein's removal from suicide watch would have been approved by both the warden of the jail and the facility's chief psychologist, said Jack Donson, a former prison official who worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades.
On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein's ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.
Giuffre, in an interview with The New York Times , said she's grateful Epstein will never harm anyone again, but is angry that there would be no chance to see him answer for his conduct.
"We've worked so hard to get here, and he stole that from us, too, she told the newspaper.
Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre's attorney, said Epstein's suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed "is no coincidence. McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said "participated and facilitated Epstein's horrifying sex trafficking scheme.
Epstein's arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.
Federal prosecutors in New York reopened the probe after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over that plea bargain.
His lawyers maintained that the new charges in New York were covered by the 2008 plea deal and that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his 13-month sentence in Florida.
Before his legal troubles, Epstein led a life of extraordinary luxury that drew powerful people into his orbit. He socialized with princes and presidents and lived on a 100-acre private Caribbean island and one of the biggest mansions in New York.

Texto completo: NEW YORK -- Guards on Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated Press.

The person said that the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Special Housing Unit was staffed with one guard working a fifth straight day of overtime and another who was working mandatory overtime. The person wasn't authorized to discuss jail operations publicly and spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity.

The jail staff failed to follow protocols leading up to Epstein's death , according to a report from The New York Times , deepening the fallout from what led to the highly connected financier's apparent suicide.

Epstein should have been checked on by guards in his cell every 30 minutes, but that didn't happen the night before his apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told the Times.

An additional federal investigation was launched Saturday after the Federal Bureau of Prison said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at a high-security jail in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead from an apparent suicide, the BOP said.

New York City's chief medical examiner released a statement Sunday evening saying an autopsy has been performed on Epstein, but that more information is needed before a cause of death determination is made.

Dr. Barbara Sampson said a city medical examiner performed the autopsy Sunday while a private pathologist observed the examination at the request of Epstein's representatives.

The private pathologist, Dr. Michael Baden, was the city's chief medical examiner in the late 1970s and has been called as an expert witness in high-profile cases including by the defense at O.J. Simpson's 1994 murder trial.

Sampson said having a private pathologist observe an autopsy is a routine practice.

Epstein's abrupt death cuts short a criminal prosecution that could have pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of the high-flying financier with connections to celebrities and presidents , though prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating.

Texto completo: OSLO — Police on Sunday were investigating a foiled attack at a mosque near Oslo as attempted terrorism. A gunman in a helmet and body armor opened fire but was overpowered before injuring anyone at the mosque.
Police said a 17-year-old found dead in the suspect's home was his stepsister.
The mosque attack prompted police to guard mosques in the city. Officers, who generally do not carry weapons, were armed for the weekend.
“I guarantee that the police are doing everything we can to keep people safe," a spokesman said.
Prime Minister Erna Solbergsaid: “This is not supposed to happen in Norway. Norway should be safe. All places of worship shall be safe." Three people were in the mosque, al-Noor Islamic Center in Baerum, preparing for Sunday's celebration of the Eid al-Adha holiday, when a gunman opened fire , the authorities said.
The suspect, who has not revealed his motives to police, recently wrote in an online forum that the gunman who killed more than 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand was “a saint" and wrote: “It's been fun. Valhalla awaits."

Texto completo: Prison guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center were reportedly working heavy overtime and did not follow the proper monitoring procedure ahead of billionaire and alleged sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's death.
According to the New York Times, guards at the Manhattan correctional facility charged with watching Epstein violated procedure the night of his death. A guard was reportedly supposed to "look into his cell" every 30 minutes, and he was supposed to have a cellmate. However, Epstein was housed alone, and the guard failed to follow the check-in procedure, according to a law enforcement source.
The Associated Press also reported on Sunday that the jail was so short staffed that guards had been working extreme overtime. One guard in particular was on his fifth day of overtime the night of Epstein's death.
Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell on Saturday morning just one day after 2,000 pages of documents were filed, revealing several names of high-profile people involved in Epstein's alleged crimes. Law enforcement officers called his death an "apparent suicide" by hanging; however, the NYC Medical Examiner has not yet ruled on an official cause of death.
Epstein had been put on suicide watch after he was found semiconscious in his cell last month, but he was reportedly no longer on suicide watch at the time of his death. His alleged suicide has been met with skepticism from many, and both the FBI and the Department of Justice's inspector general are conducting investigations into the matter.

Texto completo: THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS

TALLAHASSEE  Several Florida elections supervisors are disputing a Thursday report in Vice News that claimed their elections systems were susceptible to hacking because they were left online, possibly for months.

The report, citing the work of a group of elections security experts, claimed seven Florida counties had exposed their systems. The six counties named in the story are Bradford, Charlotte, Flagler, Wakulla, Miami-Dade and Pasco. Researchers told the New York-based current affairs channel they were unable to identify the seventh county.

But two of those counties, Miami-Dade and Wakulla counties, are disputing the report.

Miami-Dade Countys Deputy Supervisor Suzy Trutie referred reporters to the countys election security fact sheet, which says the vote tabulation server is held in an isolated network without internet access.

Others contacted by the Buzz were unaware of the Vice story or hadnt had time to read it.

Brian Corley, Pasco Countys supervisor of elections, said it wasnt his offices practice to continuously connect the election system to the internet. But he did say that his office deliberately connected the election system to the web during testing and on election night when precincts transmit the unofficial results.

In an email to the Buzz, Corley said hed need more information before commenting further.

Another county, Bradford, said that its system was online for about a day last week for routine maintenance. But the rest of the time, its disconnected.

Our elections server is shut down virtually all the time, said Bradford County Supervisor Terry Vaughan. Its kind of bad luck on our part. The one time we happen to have the server turned on was when (Vice researchers) were looking for it.

A spokeswoman for Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee, who oversees the states decentralized elections system, said the department is reviewing the report.

Any weaknesses that are identified will be addressed prior to the 2020 elections, Sarah Revell said in a statement.

Expert opinion

Mike Weisser is a lifelong member of the National Rifle Association, a former gun dealer and firearms trainer.

Weisser, who lives in Massachusetts, writes for his blog Mike the Gun Guy, and has been quoted in the New Yorker and has written essays on gun issues in the New York Times.

And he says that Florida Attorney General Ashley Moodys resistance to a proposed assault weapons ban is complete nonsense.

Weisser might know what hes talking about. The leaders of Ban Assault Weapons Now! consulted with him when they crafted the amendment they want to put on the 2020 ballot.

Weisser, who wasnt paid, spent weeks crafting a definition of assault weapons with group members.

On Monday, Moody called his work deceitful and misleading. She said the measure would ban virtually every semi-automatic long gun now sold in the state, including those that in no shape of the imagination would one think would be described as an assault weapon.

During an interview last week, Weisser said Moody is taking an overly broad interpretation of the proposed amendment.

More than half of the weapons Moody listed that would be banned under the amendment were shotguns.

Her list said theyd be outlawed because they could be equipped with extension tubes that could carry more than 10 rounds.

Theres only one problem, Weisser said. You would have a loading tube that extends a foot and a half in front of the barrel.

Gun shows

A week after two mass shootings ended with 31 people dead in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, the Republican Party of Florida is holding two voter registration drives at a South Florida gun show.

The partys regional field director emailed supporters Thursday asking for volunteers to help register voters at the Pembroke Pines gun show for Saturday and today.

This is a great opportunity to engage the community and promote the values that make this country strong, prosperous, safe and great! the email said.

The timing of the Pembroke Pines gun show has already drawn concerns from local residents, who have called the event insensitive to last weekends gun violence.

City commissioners said they dont want to host the gun show, but they already signed a contract to hold it at a city-owned venue, according to WFOR in Miami.

Pembroke Pines is a half hour away from Parkland, where a shooter killed 17 students and staff at local high school in February 2018.

State GOP chairman Joe Gruters said canceling or postponing the voter registration drive wasnt considered because we cant let a sick, deranged individual like that shooter impact the normal democratic process.

Were going to target law-abiding citizens and hopefully well pick up some new registrations there, said Gruters, a state senator from Sarasota. Were not going to let unfortunate incidents that are incredibly sad and terrible effect our efforts.

Texto completo: Depending on your politics, you either do or do not regard The New York Times as the nation's leading newspaper.
But after that paper's recent examination of the relation between travel and climate change, you must surely regard it as the nation's boldest newspaper.
The article's startling discussion results from the belief held by almost all prestigious scientists that the operation of airplanes all over the globe is an important cause of carbon dioxide emissions, and therefore of climate change.
So, the editor of the Times' travel section has asked, Can we continue to promote travel by airplanes?
The Times' somewhat hesitant response to that question: Yes, there is a relationship between travel by air and climate change.
Scientists have found that when a passenger flies between New York and Los Angeles, the passenger's share of the carbon emissions caused by that flight will cause the shrinkage of 32 square feet of the Arctic's summer ice cap.
The Times' response to this ethical conundrum? Henceforth, according to the Times' travel editor, whenever the company assigns a travel reporter to fly to various locations, the Times will contribute a relative sum of money for the purchase of carbon offsets, which are being created by a growing number of nonprofit organizations.
Apparently, several companies have emerged to create these carbon offsets, normally consisting of the planting of trees.
According to some scientists, if a trillion new trees were planted in South America, the resulting filter would put an end to climate change.
The Times asked readers of its travel section to comment on its solution to the airplane/emissions problem -- and hundreds have thus far responded.
Many of them have written critically, accusing the Times of hypocrisy and suggesting that they change the name of the travel section to the "Don't Travel Section." Their argument is that the purchase of carbon offsets by individuals will affect only a tiny and insignificant portion of the climate change problem.
Some have applauded the Times' action, while others suggested different solutions to the problem: switching to domestic travel by train, hiking to nearby travel sites, riding bicycles to vacation locations or reducing the number of instances per year in which Americans will travel by airplane. How would readers of this column respond? The question asked by the Times is a pithy one: "If seeing the world helps ruin it, should we stay at home?" By inserting that question into a search engine, you can read the numerous responses contributed by readers of The New York Times Sunday Travel section.

Texto completo: BEIJING — The death toll from a typhoon sweeping across China's east coast rose to 30 Sunday, with at least 18 missing, after downpours forced more than a million to leave their homes, the state news media reported. Nearly 5 million people in Zhejiang province have been affected by Typhoon Lekima, which made landfall early Saturday, the reports said. Many of the deaths occurred near Wenzhou, when the collapse of a natural dam set off a flash flood.
The typhoon, with winds of up to 116 miles per hour, caused major disruption, with thousands of flights canceled and trains suspended. In Zhejiang, the typhoon damaged 34,000 homes, said Xinhua, the state news agency. Officials in Linhai cited the worst flooding there in 70 years, with water as high as 36 feet.

Texto completo: OSLO — Police on Sunday were investigating a foiled attack at a mosque near Oslo as attempted terrorism. A gunman in a helmet and body armor opened fire but was overpowered before injuring anyone at the mosque.
Police said a 17-year-old found dead in the suspect's home was his stepsister.
The mosque attack prompted police to guard mosques in the city. Officers, who generally do not carry weapons, were armed for the weekend.
“I guarantee that the police are doing everything we can to keep people safe," a spokesman said.
Prime Minister Erna Solbergsaid: “This is not supposed to happen in Norway. Norway should be safe. All places of worship shall be safe." Three people were in the mosque, al-Noor Islamic Center in Baerum, preparing for Sunday's celebration of the Eid al-Adha holiday, when a gunman opened fire , the authorities said.
The suspect, who has not revealed his motives to police, recently wrote in an online forum that the gunman who killed more than 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand was “a saint" and wrote: “It's been fun. Valhalla awaits."

Texto completo: Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza was a 32-year-old lawyer with impressive credentials: an undergrad degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, and clerkships with two important federal judges. She had helped three major public figures edit their books. If she has opinions on public policy and politics, we should want — and be able — to hear them.
On June 16, 2017 she read one of Donald Trump's ubiquitous tweets. He was bragging that he would have had "zero chance" of winning the Presidency if he had believed the "fake news" from the likes of the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN. It was his old refrain.
Buckwalter-Poza, one of 60 million Trump Twitter followers, could not resist responding. "To be fair, you didn't win the White House," she wrote. "Russia won it for you."
Suddenly, she recalled, "I stopped getting alerts for Trump's tweets. When other people were commenting on them, I would see all these gray boxes in my feed. I didn't realize what was happening immediately." She thought it was a Twitter error.
Buckwalter-Poza had been banned, censored, muted, gagged, silenced. In legal parlance, she had a "prior restraint" put on her by the man who described Twitter as "an incredible way of communicating." Unless, of course, you disagree with or criticize him.
In olden times, when the king did not like your words, he cut off your tongue or severed your writing hand. The Framers remembered this, which is why they insisted on an amendment to our constitution that would stop central authorities — and bullies — from silencing the opposition and muting dissent.
Old or new world, the result was the same: The most powerful government official in America had chosen to "block" a citizen. We do it all the time on social media when someone offends or annoys us. But we are private citizens; the President is not and court after court has made clear, the government cannot engage in "viewpoint discrimination." Respond, rebut, even call someone by those sixth-grade nasty names the President likes. But you can't censor.
"It felt so surreal," Buckwalter-Poza said. "It's really startling to think that the President of the United States is taking the time to individually block people.
You'd think he would be busy doing other things."
Nothing, of course, should ever surprise us from this White House. But when the actions violate the U.S. Constitution it should certainly make us furious — and scared. Because silencing Buckwalter-Poza was unconstitutional — at least to everyone but Donald Trump.
"It was unbelievable to me that the leader of the U.S. would be suppressing speech and blocking voices," she wrote. And thus far it has been unbelievable to two federal courts where she and seven others filed a lawsuit in 2018. The appeals court called the evidence "overwhelming that the President's feed is public, not private."
"He may not selectively exclude those whose views he disagrees with," the judges wrote. The reason is simple: We need to hear from each other, not just the chosen few who support the authorities.
This Twitter case is not frivolous. It makes clear to government that social media forums are the new public square, places where citizens need to be able to engage each other — and elected officials. Where we can talk to each other in an uninhibited fashion. Where we can air our grievances and offer our views.
But the larger issue is about the ability and right to dissent, to disagree with our government and to not have the central authorities muffle the opinions they don't like.
Said the court: "While he is certainly not required to listen, once he opens up the interactive features of his account to the public at large [the President] is not entitled to censor."
One would have thought all this was settled eons ago. John Peter Zenger in 1735 criticized the royal governor of New York for what he saw as a series of abuses. Zenger was jailed but a jury of New Yorkers quickly said that a fundamental right in the colonies should be the ability to criticize its rulers. Zenger was free to dissent, as is Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza.
But this President just doesn't get it. He is a direct descendant of the European authorities who would cut off your tongue if you dissented.
Ask Dan Coats, Trump's director of national intelligence, who was recently pushed out. He had the audacity to be the adult in the room on foreign policy for more than two years, regularly challenging the President. So he had to go. Ask the kneeling football players who dare protest police brutality. It is the President's prerogative to fire and to disagree but it speaks to his "don't confuse-me-with-the-facts, my-mind-is-made-up" mentality.
And while the First Amendment's meaning is often disputed, some things are clear. The Framers wanted to ensure that the authorities could not silence their opponents — including the press — as they would naturally want to do, and as this President has consistently tried. They wanted a nation where people were free to voice opinions — misguided or not. The debate was to be a central part of democratic self-government.
The irony in this, the court concluded recently, "is that we write at a time in the history of this nation when the conduct of our government and its officials is subject to wide-open, robust debate." The debate "generates a level of passion and intensity the likes of which have rarely been seen."
But, the judges reasoned, "as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be" the debate "is a good thing. If the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less."
The Twitter case speaks to an even larger issue that is destroying America: the President's inability to listen, to accept other viewpoints, to be civil, and to be tolerant. The shooter in El Paso who killed 20 people was responding to cues: We will be intolerant of other people. The First Amendment was meant to promote the opposite — mutual toleration of contrasting points of view.

Trump's Pile Of Rubble

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- One of the most totemic pictures of the Obama era was a White House photo showing the president bowing to let a 5-year-old black boy touch his hair.
As Jackie Calmes reported in The Times, the boy, the son of a departing National Security Council staffer, had shyly told Barack Obama, "I want to know if my hair is just like yours."
"Touch it, dude!" the president instructed the child.
It was a moment that summed up all the giddy dreams about race and modernity and a gleaming American future that propelled a freshman senator with an exotic name into office.
Now, one of the most totemic pictures of the Trump era has been tweeted by Melania from the El Paso hospital visited by the first couple amid the blood-dimmed tide of back-to-back gun massacres in Texas and Dayton.
The first lady is holding 2-month-old Paul Anchondo, whose parents, Jordan and Andre, died shielding him from a shooter who confessed to the police that he drove from his home in Allen, Tex., to El Paso to kill Mexicans with an AK-47-style rifle. A manifesto he posted on 8chan, an online forum that's a haven for white nationalists, stated that he wanted to stop the "Hispanic invasion of Texas."
President Trump, standing next to Melania and the baby in the picture, is grinning and giving a thumbs-up.
The infant's uncle, Tito Anchondo, told reporters that he brought Paul to the hospital to meet Trump, while other victims refused to do so, because he wanted to tell the president about the pain of the family. His slain brother, he said, was a Trump supporter. He told The Washington Post that he felt consoled by Trump.
But still, there is something sickening about the photo. The picture of Obama with a child was luminous with hope and idealism. The one of Trump with a child was dark with pain and shattered ideals.
Devoid of empathy and humanity, Trump is mugging with an infant who will never know his parents. They were shot by a psychopath whose views echoed Trump's dangerous and vile rants painting people with darker skin -- like the baby's father -- as the enemy, an infestation and invasion aiming to take something away from real Americans. It is the same slimy chum thrown out by other Republicans, only more brutally direct and not limited to campaign season.
Even as we absorbed the grotesque image from the hospital, we had to watch the heart-rending footage of Hispanic children sobbing and stranded in Mississippi because their parents, many working at a chicken processing plant, had been rounded up by ICE.
The Post featured a disturbing headline on Monday about a new study: "Risk of Premature Birth Increased for Latinas After Trump's Election." The story said, "Researchers have begun to identify correlations between Trump's election and worsening cardiovascular health, sleep problems, anxiety and stress, especially among Latinos in the United States."
The shining city on a hill is an ugly pile of rubble.
Even on this most tragic of weeks for so many families, Trump was obsessing on himself, on his crowd size compared with Beto, and on whether he was getting enough obeisance from Ohio pols.
It defies one's faith in the good sense and decency of America that we cannot stop the deluge of shooting rampages -- even at a time of unprecedented weakness for the N.R.A. and the loathsome Wayne LaPierre, with the gun lobby awash in coup attempts and corruption.
Gun control has the aspect of an intractable problem when it is anything but. Inexplicably and abhorrently, we have decided to live with periodic human sacrifices. That became clear in 2012 in Newtown after the slaughter of the "beautiful babies," as Joe Biden called the dead first graders. If that didn't shock the soul enough to act, what could?
We've heard Trump talk about talking sense into N.R.A. officials three times now, during the 2016 campaign and after the Parkland shooting and again Friday after his sympathy calls in Dayton and El Paso. The first two times, he caved to the N.R.A. quickly.
Yet temperamentally, Nixon-to-China, Trump is suited to that job. Even though he's a belligerent, he's not so enamored of war and guns. "My sons love hunting," he once tweeted. "I don't." He's no gun nut; he's a former Democrat from New York who likes to golf.
If he wanted to lead a crusade to get real background checks -- or even a ban on assault weapons, which he said in a 2000 book that he favored -- he would be formidable.
There is some movement now because the Republicans are scared -- not of the shooters but of suburban voters.
For the most part, Republicans are gun owners and Democrats aren't. But Republican voters are more supportive of common-sense gun control than elected members, who are wallowing with the swamp creatures at the N.R.A.
Mitch McConnell, Dr. No, won't want to do anything; his spokesman was backing away on Friday. That same day, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, John Barrasso, pumped the brakes on possible inroads, background checks and red-flag laws.
If the president and Republicans come up with anything at all, it will be a remedy just marginal enough to give themselves cover, denying Democrats a powerful campaign issue.
Moscow Mitch and Dreadful Donald will keep talking compromise and hope that things settle down by September, when Congress gets back.
But point-blank: Our Republican leaders are cowards.
We shouldn't let things die down. Because people keep dying.

Dems eye presidential candidates in crammed field

Texto completo: Several North Dakota Democrats say they're looking for presidential candidates to connect with voters in Middle America as their party struggles to gain traction in the state's elections.
National polls suggest former Vice President Joe Biden is the current frontrunner among a crowded field of candidates seeking to take on President Donald Trump next year. Biden visited North Dakota twice last year in support of Heidi Heitkamp's failed Senate re-election bid.
But the campaign is still in its early days, and some North Dakota Democrats are already voicing support for other candidates.
House Minority Leader Josh Boschee, who will be a "superdelegate" at the party's national convention in July 2020, said he's supporting South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Rhodes scholar with military experience who Boschee said has brought a level-headed attitude to the debate stage. He said Buttigieg's Indiana roots should help him understand concerns from the Midwest.
"I just continue to be impressed with his real-life experience," Boschee said. "He's new, he's an outsider."
Boschee, North Dakota's first openly gay lawmaker, also said the mayor's sexual orientation hasn't proven to be an issue in the campaign. He said he reached out to Buttigieg's camp to invite him to North Dakota, but plans for a visit haven't been announced.
Dina Baird, another one of North Dakota's four superdelegates, said she hasn't yet picked a favorite candidate.
North Dakota Democratic-NPL Chairwoman Kylie Oversen said the state party has amended its bylaws to require superdelegates to vote in line with caucus results at the national convention. Superdelegates have been free to support the candidate of their choosing, though the Democratic National Committee reduced their power to pick the nominee last year.
In March, the Democratic-NPL Party will hold a vote to determine the number of North Dakota delegates awarded to presidential candidates at the national convention. North Dakota's delegates to the 2016 Democratic National Convention mostly sided with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as Hillary Clinton secured the party's nomination.
In the current campaign, Sanders is leading the race for individual donors in North Dakota, according to a New York Times analysis. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Buttigieg are also finding support from North Dakota's early donors.
Further down the list of potential nominees is Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, whom Tim Purdon, a former U.S. attorney for North Dakota, is supporting as a member of his campaign finance committee. Purdon said they met in the mid-2000s as private practice attorneys and later worked together in law enforcement - Bullock was Montana's attorney general before being elected governor in 2012.
Purdon touted Bullock's ability to attract red state voters, noting he won re-election in 2016 even while Trump carried his state.
"And I think that's very important as the Democratic Party tries to take back in the Electoral College states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan," he said.
Mac Schneider, a former North Dakota state senator who unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year, similarly argued the eventual nominee will need to compete in places that Democrats have previously "written off."
"I'm under no delusions about how difficult it would be for whoever the nominee is to win North Dakota, but I think if all you do is focus on the coasts and the suburbs, that's a recipe for something less than success," he said.
Several North Dakota Democrats surveyed by Forum News Service said they haven't yet decided who to back for president. Schneider highlighted Buttigieg as a candidate with "a lot of appeal" to North Dakotans and said he's a "big fan" of Biden.
It was only 11 years ago that former President Barack Obama and Biden lost North Dakota by less than 10 percentage points on the way to their first term in the White House. But that partisan gap has widened in the years since, and Trump drubbed Clinton by 36 percentage points here in 2016.
State GOP Chairman Rick Berg said the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates' positions on immigration, energy and gun control are out of step with those of most North Dakotans.
"It's going to be a real clear contrast between Trump and any one of those top-tier Democrat candidates," he said.
With Heitkamp's loss last year, Democrats hold no statewide elected offices in North Dakota and only about one-sixth of the seats in the Legislature.
Heitkamp has since helped launch the "One Country Project" initiative to help Democrats' electoral prospects in rural areas. The former senator was unavailable for an interview this week, but in a fundraising email for the new initiative, she focused on Senate races instead of the presidential contest.
"Unless we do a better job engaging rural Americans, Republicans will have a massive head start in every race for a Senate majority," she wrote. "And without a Democratic Senate, it won't matter who wins the White House in 2020: We'll be stuck with at least two more years of GOP obstruction in Congress."
Oversen was "grateful that we've got a slate of really strong candidates from all over the country," but she said the presidential debates have featured a "noticeable absence" of discussion on the Trump administration's trade tariffs and their effect on agricultural producers.
"We want to make sure that all of these candidates are prepared not only to talk about the issues, but to address them thoughtfully and strategically," she said.

Texto completo: If you're a fan of "Property Brothers" stars Drew and Jonathan Scott, you can see them next month in Orlando.
They're touring in support of their book "Builder Brothers: Better Together."
It goes on sale Sept. 10. Their tour stops at 6 p.m. Sept. 11 at the Barnes & Noble in Colonial Plaza Mall. The store's address: 2418 E. Colonial Drive.
"Builder Brothers: Better Together" is another picture book. They made their debut in the genre last year with "Builder Brothers: Big Plans," which became a New York Times bestseller. Both books present adventures for Drew and Jonathan as kids.
Here's a preview of the new book from HarperCollins: "Young Drew and Jonathan do everything together. They're not just twins; they're best friends. So when their town sponsors a soapbox derby race, Drew and Jonathan are first in line to enter. But when the rubber hits the road and the brothers just can't agree on how to build the best car, they wind up competing against each other! Can one of them win without the other?"
The book's listed price is $17.99.
It is billed, in the preview, as "a hilarious and heartwarming story that reminds young readers that everything is better when you work together."
Their series "Property Brothers: Forever Home" premiered in May on HGTV. The brothers will be part of "A Very Brady Renovation" debuting at 9 p.m. Sept. 9 on HGTV. That series explains the renovation of the "Brady Bunch" house.
The six actors who played the "Brady Bunch" children will take part: Barry Williams (Greg), Maureen McCormick (Marcia), Christopher Knight (Peter), Eve Plumb (Jan), Mike Lookinland (Bobby) and Susan Olsen (Cindy).

Texto completo: After each mass shooting in America, the nation relives a near-scripted clash: calls for stricter gun laws, pushback from pro-gun activists led by the National Rifle Association, and an ultimate impasse.
But this time – following seven days that left at least 35 people dead in shootings in Gilroy, California; El Paso, Texas; and Dayton, Ohio – one side of that power struggle appears to have shifted.
The NRA is busy managing another crisis: Its own.
For months it has weathered a series of public spectacles stemming from both infighting and outside scrutiny. Most recently, in the middle of last week's mass shootings, three members of the NRA board resigned, citing concerns over irresponsible spending by the group's leaders.
The NRA's opponents see the chaos as a vulnerability, something not lost on supporters who have grown frustrated with the national organization.
"Those of us who are plugged into this, who are living it, are wondering why this is happening and why it seemingly isn't being fixed," said Mark Walters, an NRA member and host of the syndicated Armed American Radio. "(Especially) at a time it is so important that we have a strong National Rifle Association coming into 2020, in particular on the heels of this mess with California, El Paso, and Dayton."
A spokesman for the NRA did not respond to a request to interview CEO Wayne LaPierre, instead providing a statement that touted "a string of recent victories" under the NRA's new political team.
"With many in the media writing the obituary of the NRA, we are scoring big wins in the legislative, legal, and public policy arenas," Andrew Arulanandam wrote.
The NRA's opponents see them as putting on a good face.
"I've never seen them weaker," said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national advocacy group. "I think that they have been very much sidelined."
As proof, he pointed to the fact that gun control groups outspent gun rights groups in the 2018 midterm elections. The gun control lobby spent about $12.1 million to the gun rights' $10 million ($8.2 million of that coming from the NRA), according to numbers compiled by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks lobbying and election spending.
And that, he said, was all "before the five-alarm fire."
The turmoil in the NRA has been unfolding for months. The group began the year by downplaying its relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian agent later convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison for trying to infiltrate political organizations on behalf of the Kremlin. Butina had become cozy with the group, including helping to host a delegation of NRA insiders in Moscow in 2015. McClatchy has reported that the Justice Department is investigating whether one of her associates, former Russian official and NRA member Alexander Torshin, illegally moved Russian money through the group to back President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
In April, the organization's president, Oliver North, was forced out after raising concerns about the group's finances and amid allegations he had attempted to engineer the removal of LaPierre. LaPierre, who accused North of extortion, is now facing increased pressure to resign, including from deep-pocketed donors concerned about the ongoing strife, The New York Times has reported.
The New York Attorney General's Office also is investigating the NRA's tax-exempt status. And the District of Columbia attorney general has another probe into the organization and its charitable foundation.
Even with public pressure from the recent mass shootings, many watching the debate are skeptical the NRA's troubles will dramatically move the needle on gun control legislation. Congress has not passed broad changes for decades.
Lawmakers considering new gun measures know that how they vote will influence whether the NRA endorses them – one of the most powerful tools at the organization's disposal, said Adam Winkler, a professor at the UCLA School of Law. "The threat is always there and I think that is enough to sway a lot of lawmakers," he said.
Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke University who focuses on gun control, said he doubts the NRA's troubles will have much impact. "The sides are pretty firmly dug in, I think, legislatively," he said.
He said the impact could be more dramatic down the line if the problems persist and discourage donations.
Activists in battleground states are watching the NRA's strife closely.
Shira Goodman, executive director of the nonprofit CeaseFire PA, said she hopes the "the lawsuits, the turmoil, the internal dissension, the attempted coups" will damage the NRA's brand.
She and others stressed, though, that the NRA still has its biggest asset: single-issue, pro-gun voters it can mobilize in an election. "Those people will take the NRA voting guide to the polls," Goodman said. "And that is not going to disappear overnight."

Texto completo: Soviet tanks rumbled into Prague in 1968 even as a dark comedy about the spread of Nazi ideology in occupied Czechoslovakia was in production. The film's leading man went briefly into hiding, but "The Cremator" was completed the following year and, inevitably, banned. Few movies have shown the capitulation to a totalitarian worldview more mordantly.
Shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1973 as part of the "New Directors/New Films" series, "The Cremator" is getting a belated theatrical run in a new digital restoration at Metrograph, as part of retrospective devoted to its director, Juraj Herz.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Herz, who died last year, was a close friend of the great Czech animator Jan Svankmajer, with whom he studied puppetry and intermittently worked. The two also had a similar subversively gothic sensibility. "The Cremator," adapted from a novel by Ladislav Fuks, is a disquieting mix of satire and horror, filled with inexplicable characters seen in fragmentary close-ups or through distorted lenses.
The blandly creepy protagonist, Karel Kopfrkingl (played by the portly, moon-faced Rudolf Hrusinsky, a frequent presence in Czech new wave films), is a petty bourgeois monster -- an unctuous mortician, abstinent yet authoritarian, who lords over his wife and children as well as the impressive crematory that he calls the "temple of death."
Kopfrkingl rarely stops talking -- persistently explaining himself in soft, insinuating tones, and frequently referencing the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. His worldview is altered, if not shaken, by a former comrade-in-arms, Walter Reinke, who arrives in Prague in advance of Hitler's army.
Reinke, an Austrian with whom Kopfrkingl served during World War I, persuades him that, thanks to a supposed drop of German blood, Kopfrkingl is something more -- and better -- than Czech. Thus Kopfrkingl becomes co-opted into the ideology of the Third Reich, incorporating Nazi theories about euthanasia and racial purity into his own philosophy.
In its dark comedy, "The Cremator" has been compared to mid-1960s landmarks like Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" and Roman Polanski's "Repulsion." (It also evokes "The Loved One," Tony Richardson's 1965 satire of Hollywood burial practices.) But the movie has its own ominous mood. The foreboding is accentuated by Kopfrkingl's visit to a wax museum populated by living models, and the brutal boxing match to which Reinke insists on taking him.
As he falls under Reinke's spell, it becomes apparent that Kopfrkingl, this fastidious apostle of cremation, is presiding over the death of Czechoslovakia -- and that he has also lost his mind. The movie's ending is a shocker if you haven't read the novel, and perhaps even if you have. (Herz, who survived World War II in a Nazi concentration camp, drops all understatement during the final 10 minutes.)
The New York Times critic Roger Greenspun was put off by Herz's mannerism, which he found reflective of "the limitation of East-European cinema." But he did allow that Kopfrkingl was "a creation of considerable interest." That's certainly one way to describe it.

By Ken Newton
Lucille Osborn grew up in Northwest Missouri before going to Washington to serve in the War Crimes Division of the Pentagon. She would later work two dozen years for the municipal government of Cameron, Missouri.
As with nearly everyone, life proved a mix of the unusual and the humdrum.
But there came that day, a camera pointed her way, when the city clerk shared a moment with Michael Douglas.
It happened right there at the intersection of Third and Chestnut streets, the future Oscar-winner climbing out of an orange Porsche 911T and seeking directions from Lucille, she in a summer dress and carrying a sack of groceries.
He pointed one direction. She motioned the opposite way.
For this modest interaction, Osborn, who died in 2010, got a modest check from a Hollywood production company.
Film preserves this, a movie called “Adam at 6 A.M.” Don’t look for it among the honored movies of 1970. The New York Times film critic wrote that it “sneers at Mid-America.”
In this case, though, it stands out for a couple of reasons. It came at the beginning of a distinguished career by Douglas, the son of Hollywood royalty. (Not every kid sees “Spartacus” sitting across the breakfast table.)
Beyond that, the eldest child of Kirk Douglas and a film crew came to Cameron 50 years ago to shoot scenes for “Adam at 6 A.M.”
Stan Hendrix, a 911 call taker who doubles as a researcher for the Cameron Historical Society, said he thought he could take a couple of days and look into this. It turned into a journey of more than six years.
“There are just hundreds of wonderful stories that bounce around regarding what happened,” he said.”It didn’t change the town, but it was a big event in our history and people are still proud to be able to say that Hollywood came to Cameron.”
The story of Cameron’s involvement in the movie suggests some serendipity. One of the screenwriters, Elinor Karpf, had been born in Kansas City and intended the movie to be set in Excelsior Springs.
Location scouts needed a country church, a small-town tavern, a new housing development, a drive-in theater and a downtown area for filming. Excelsior Springs checked all the boxes but one. The production people didn’t like the downtown, Hendrix said.
Karpf said she had an uncle who lived in Cameron, a community with a pleasant downtown. Why not look there?
“They basically came to Cameron because they liked the looks of downtown Cameron better than Excelsior Springs for the purposes of the film,” Hendrix said. Not only that, they change the town name in the movie to Cameron.
The narrative involves semantics professor Adam Gaines’ (Douglas) disillusion with his superficial life in California. Just as his spring semester ends, he learns of the death of a relative in Missouri, a woman he had never seen. Still, he jumps into his Porsche and drives more than 1,600 miles to the funeral.
There, he meets a woman (played by acting newcomer Lee Purcell) who seems the ideal small-town girl, complete with a knack for making apple pie. Adam decides to hang around, taking a summer job with a utility crew clearing timber and sleeping under the stars.
The movie had a good pedigree, brought to the screen by Steve McQueen’s production company.
Joe Don Baker chews up scenery as Harvey, a tree-cutting partner who yearns to be a TV repairman, this role three years before his huge success in “Walking Tall.” Louise Latham, who acted in Alfred Hitchcock and Steven Spielberg films, also had a supporting role.
Hendrix, who has lived in Cameron since 1970, moving there at age 10, revels in finding little nuggets of information that built upon the town’s rich history.
The “Adam at 6 A.M.” research added to this broader story. He drove up and down Interstate 35 to identify landscapes from the film. He went to the Salem Christian Union Church near Excelsior Springs, site of the movie’s funeral service. He talked to people who had been extras in the Cameron shots.
One of them, Michael Phillips, made it into the film at 5 months of age. He got paid for his work, even having to get a Social Security number (unusual for babies in those days) so taxes could be withheld.
In the Cameron Depot Museum, the family’s pay stubs can be found, each of the checks netting $11.68 from a $15 payment.
The researcher would learn, too, that the movie would not be universally well-received in Cameron. The reason: A California scene in the movie showed Adam’s previous girlfriend getting out of bed.
“There is a very brief shot of a bare breast,” Hendrix said. “On the West Coast, they probably thought there was nothing to it.” In Cameron, when the film opened in 1970, it did not go over so well.
Another tidbit. Nine years after the filming, Douglas and his wife, Diandra, had their first child. They named him Cameron.

In era of division, we can make too much of a headline

Texto completo: It is hard for me to read some of the reaction to a derided New York Times headline without a smirk, a sigh and a forlorn shake of the head.
The controversy begins with the paper’s original headline Tuesday over a Page 1 story describing President Donald Trump’s statement on the weekend mass murders in Dayton and El Paso. "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM," the headline declares. It was changed for later editions to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
Critics on the left, led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeting a veiled criticism from statistics guru Nate Silver, declared the original headline as evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the right. Critics on the right, led by the usual crowd on Fox News and the president himself, declared the change to be evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the left.
Advocates of both sides declared it evidence that the newspaper could not be trusted. A Twitter campaign was mounted, presumably uniting the opposing forces against a common enemy, to encourage people to cancel their subscriptions to the Times. This all struck me as ridiculous and shortsighted.
Neither side made reference to the story the headline described, which, it is probably relevant to note, had way more than 280 characters and which, while no objective reader could find it particularly balanced, conveyed a thorough description of the issues it addressed with substantial and substantive commentary from many points of view.
Why, I wonder, are we so eager, so quick, so hungry to bend any opportunity into a sweeping political generality?
It’s not that headlines aren’t important or that editors don’t approach them with care. They are and we do. Even before the Daily Herald’s designers had begun framing out Tuesday’s front page, editor John Lampinen emphasized that we must take care not to ignore the president’s emphatic and clear condemnation of racism in whatever headline we came up with. (Ours, by the way, was "Trump condemns racism, focuses on mental illness.") But headlines are just one component in the telling of a story. They are a summary, produced — as a Times deputy managing editor wrote in describing the evolution of the headline in question — under the twin pressures of time and space, and they are not especially conducive to expressing nuance.
The truth is that both New York Times headlines are correct. It’s equally true that the second more completely describes the story. It’s also true that neither summarizes the whole story. What’s troubling is that both were so easily transformed into irrelevant talking points for the right and left.
And what’s most true — what’s really behind my smirk and my sighs — is that it is such utter nonsense to decry The New York Times as untrustworthy because of a headline. Those who want to define the paper as liberal can find plenty of evidence. Those who want to claim that the Times cost Hillary Clinton the election by focusing on her emails will not be deterred by disputation. But it is utterly ludicrous to suggest that you will not be well-informed and thoroughly engaged if you actually read The New York Times. Or The Washington Post, for that matter, or The Wall Street Journal or many other newspapers, large, medium and small, that qualify as whatever mainstream means.
Will you come across phrases, descriptions, opinions, news judgments and, yes, headlines that bother you? Yes, you will. Unless you rely on a single news source that shares your views and your thinking entirely, you will sometimes be angered and disappointed by things you see or read. But, you will not be better informed by abandoning some reliable news source. To the contrary, if you want to be better informed, you will add to your sphere of information.
So smirk sometimes. Roll your eyes occasionally. But be bigger than the rare annoyances and shortcomings you encounter. You’ll be better for it and more knowledgeable regarding the events and issues you care about.

Those who want to claim that the Times cost Hillary Clinton the election by focusing on her emails will not be deterred by disputation. But it is utterly ludicrous to suggest that you will not be well-informed and thoroughly engaged if you actually read The New York Times. Or The Washington Post, for that matter, or The Wall Street Journal or many other newspapers, large, medium and small, that qualify as whatever mainstream means.
Will you come across phrases, descriptions, opinions, news judgments and, yes, headlines that bother you? Yes, you will. Unless you rely on a single news source that shares your views and your thinking entirely, you will sometimes be angered and disappointed by things you see or read. But, you will not be better informed by abandoning some reliable news source. To the contrary, if you want to be better informed, you will add to your sphere of information.
So smirk sometimes. Roll your eyes occasionally. But be bigger than the rare annoyances and shortcomings you encounter. You’ll be better for it and more knowledgeable regarding the events and issues you care about.

Texto completo: EL PASO — Hours before President Trump arrived in this desert city on the Mexico border, high school students clad in black released white balloons for every one of the 22 victims killed in one of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history.
Hundreds of people later gathered at a central park to protest the president's visit, saying he had inflamed the kind of racial and ethnic hostilities that led the shooter to target Latinos at a Walmart in the commercial center of the city. Condemnation of the president's anti-immigrant rhetoric has been inescapable, too, at a memorial near the site of the shooting where people have stopped by the thousands — after work, between lunch breaks, often in scorching heat — to march and pray and drop off flowers, stuffed animals, and balloons.
As Trump and his wife, Melania, visited survivors and offered what administration officials said was a message of national unity, they found a city fighting through grief, and some grappling with its identity as the epicenter of the nation's immigration battle. And there were many who didn't want him there at all.
“I think he should have waited," said Aracely Calderon, 40, a native of neighboring Ciudad Juárez in Mexico and a retail manager at a Fort Bliss store, who came to pay her respects Wednesday evening at the memorial. “I just think it was very disrespectful of him."
The president's visit to El Paso came after a stop at the site of another mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio, that left another nine dead just hours after the massacre in Texas. Against the backdrop of the Franklin mountains, he jumped into his motorcade with only a wave to reporters after shaking hands and briefly chatting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, and El Paso Mayor Dee Margo.
Speaking to reporters on the tarmac, Margo said Trump asked him how it was going: “I told him it was one day at time."
“Your thoughts on the president coming to El Paso?" a reporter asked.
“Well, he is the president," Margo replied as he walked away.
Deflecting questions about the president's racist comments toward four congresswomen and anti-immigrant rhetoric, Cruz instead shifted attention to the shooter in Dayton, saying he was a supporter of Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
“Sadly no party has a monopoly on hate, no party has a monopoly on racism and bigotry," he said.
Latinos nationwide have been grappling with new levels of fear after the targeted attacks, and the impact has been acutely felt in El Paso, which is 80 percent Hispanic and where people live fluidly between Mexico and the United States. Investigators say a white supremacist drove almost 11 hours from the Dallas area before opening fire inside the Walmart. Prosecutors are investigating the crime as an act of domestic terrorism after investigators linked an anti-immigrant and anti-Latino screed to the 21-year-old white man accused in the attack. The posting used some of the same rhetoric the president has used regarding immigrants.
The president further angered some El Pasoans on Monday, when he condemned white supremacy but omitted any reference to Latinos and failed to address his own incendiary language.
Trump didn't help matters on Wednesday when — before boarding Air Force One on his way to Ohio — he took shots on Twitter at his political foes, The New York Times, and “radical left Democrats." Among his targets was Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, an El Paso native and former US representative, whom the president taunted over his name.
O'Rourke shot back with a tweet of his own, “22 in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism. El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I."
At a tribute ceremony for victims at El Dorado High School on Wednesday morning, student council members said they organized the event and invited O'Rourke to speak because they wanted to show the nation a positive image of their city.
“I think it's like you're damned if you do, damned if you don't," senior class vice president Khendra Jacome, 17, said of her conflicting feelings about the president's visit. “That is why I fought so much to get Beto O'Rourke here because he's from here, he knows the type of community that we have . . . so you know, I thought let's fight the negative with the positive."
After praying with students and shaking hands, O'Rourke told reporters he shot back at the president “because he's trying to intimidate this community, make us afraid of one another, of our differences, of the border, of immigrants, and we will not stand down."
He and US Representative Veronica Escobar, whose district includes the Walmart where the shooting took place, later opted to attend the counter-rally at Washington Park.
By the time the sun began to set over the mountains, the crowds were back at the Walmart, where white crosses with the names and photos of victims overlook a parking lot still filled with cars left behind. Some have left placards denouncing the shooter and also Trump for their hateful views.
“If you only got to know our people, our streets, our culture," reads one sign, “then you would see how precious our city is."

'Wrong way to do it': Congressman takes heat for tweeting Trump donor names

Texto completo: Democratic Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro received widespread criticism Tuesday after he shared the names and professions of 44 San Antonio residents who donated the maximum amount to President Trump's reelection campaign.
Castro shared an image through the Twitter account of his reelection campaign with information about the donors and their employers. "Sad to see so many San Antonians as 2019 maximum donors to Donald Trump — the owner of ⁦@BillMillerBarBQ⁩, owner of the ⁦@HistoricPearl, realtor Phyllis Browning, etc⁩." The tweet said. "Their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as 'invaders.'"
Tweet
Castro, who is also the chairman of his brother Julián Castro's presidential campaign, was panned by pundits and lawmakers for sharing the names in a perceived effort to target private citizens. The maximum legal donation is $2,800 for primary and general campaigns, prohibiting any individual from donating more than $5,600. The Federal Election Commission reports all donors who give over $200 to one campaign.
"Targeting and harassing Americans because of their political beliefs is shameful and dangerous. What happened to 'when they go low, we go high?' Or does that no longer matter when your brother is polling at 1%? Americans deserve better," House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted.
Tweet
"People should not be personally targeted for their political views. Period," said Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who was shot by a liberal activist Bernie Sanders supporter during a 2017 congressional baseball event. "This isn’t a game. It’s dangerous, and lives are at stake. I know this firsthand."
Tweet
It was not just Republicans, however, that spoke out against Castro's decision to share information about his own constituents. "The campaign of a member of congress targeting individual donors, and their businesses, to another campaign (and not famous billionaires) is a terrible and dangerous precedent to set," journalist Yashar Ali said in a tweet. "Also, this isn't even Joaquin Castro's opponent. Not that it would be ok if it were. Awful."
Tweet
"Don't want to RT this because I don't want to put these people's names in my feed but this is dangerous, by any campaign," said New York Times White House correspondent and frequent Trump critic Maggie Haberman Tuesday evening.
Tweet
Former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in an appearance on Fox News that she didn't agree with Castro's tactic, either, especially in light of the recent targeted shooting attacks that claimed the lives of 31 people. "This is a tactic that people are using in the sort of ... hyper-polarized environment to sort of call people out. I think it's the wrong way to do it, but that's what's happening," she said on The Five.

Press secretary for Julián Castro, Sawyer Hackett, defended the decision to tweet out the 44 names later on Tuesday, comparing the private citizens of San Antonio to major celebrities. He responded to the assertion that he was drawing attention to otherwise nonnewsworthy individuals comprised of retirees, homemakers, and small business owners, tweeting, "Guess it depends on what you decide is newsworthy. I’d like to know whether the local BBQ restaurant I patronize funds Trump’s xenophobia as much as any celebrity."

State rules Madison doesn’t have to pay $1 million tax abatement to former mill

Texto completo: Madison Paper Industries has 30 days to appeal the decision, but its lawyer, Jonathan A. Block, has not received indication of the company's plans to do so as of Monday afternoon.

MADISON — A shuttered paper mill’s tax abatement request of over $1 million has been formally rejected by the state’s tax review board, according to a decision handed down Thursday.
Madison’s Town Manager Tim Curtis said the outcome, which was first announced in April, is welcome news for residents. Since Madison Paper Industries — which closed three years ago — filed the abatement request in 2017, the town drew over $500,000 from a line of credit and budgeted about $400,000 from taxpayers to help cover the potential costs had the decision gone the other way. It has since paid off the loan and — with voter approval at a Town Meeting in June — decided to apply the $400,000 to a handful of capital projects rather than put it toward reducing this year’s taxes.
Those projects, Curtis noted, include road repairs and the purchase of equipment for highways and the fire department.
Jonathan A. Block, the lawyer representing Madison Paper Industries, said Monday afternoon that he had not heard from the company about whether it wanted to appeal the decision. The group has 30 days to do so.
“This written response is good for us going forward because there’s a (limited) window for Madison Paper Industries to appeal,” Curtis said. “We don’t know whether they will appeal this decision, but we will know within 30 days.”
Madison Paper Industries, which supplied the New York Times with supercalendered paper used for advertising inserts, shut down operations in May 2016 and sold the mill property to Greg Shain of Somerset Acquisitions for $2 million in Dec. 2016. In April 2016, when the town made its tax assessments, representatives of Madison Paper Industries argued that the property should be valued as liquidated because of the company’s announced intention to close later in the year. Both the town and state appeals board considered that logic “unpersuasive.”
“On April 1, 2016, the mill, as then used, was producing paper and operating unrestrictedly in the black,” the state decision, handed down Aug. 1, reads. “A gas pipeline recently had been put in place, and the owners had been successful in securing the imposition of a tariff on the importation of Canadian paper that competed with the SC paper produced on the premises by MPI. The property was considered ‘state of the art’, and neither the NYT or UPM (MPI’s partner owners) was in financial difficulty.”
Madison’s Board of Assessors had already agreed to depreciate the mill assets by $8 million in 2016 due to “economic obsolescence” on top of approving a $123.8 million reduction in its valuation two years prior to that. While the town board opted to assess the mill assets in 2016 at $38,070,181, Madison Paper Industries pursued a $2,265,000 valuation. The town’s tax rate for 2016 was $21 per $1,000 of assessed value.
“We’re very pleased that the state board listened to the town and understood our point that when Madison Paper Industries announced in March 2016 that it would be closing, it didn’t justify a liquidation value on their property,” Curtis said.
The paper company also sought an assessment of $31,787,000 for that part of the company’s two hydroelectric dams sited in Madison that with the Anson dam provided 40% of the Madison mill’s energy. Officials had valued that property at $34,292,500 in 2016. The state board rejected the paper company’s request for a lower valuation on its hydro property because it did not deviate more than 10% from the municipality’s assessment, as is required by state law to prove substantial overvaluation.
In the meantime, the former paper mill site has changed hands again, with Belfast company GO Lab Inc. closing on the property next week, according to Curtis. The new owner plans to redevelop the site into a manufacturing hub for wood fiber insulation, bringing 100 jobs with it. Madison Paper Industries had employed 214 people when it shut down in 2016.

Texto completo: The founder of 8chan, the message board known for its ardent support for freedom of speech, has argued that the site should be shut down after the El Paso shooter posted his manifesto on the site.
Fredrick Brennan, who founded the free speech site in 2013, called for the website to end in an interview with the New York Times Sunday.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”Fredrick BrennanOn Saturday, the alleged gunman who killed 20 people in an El Paso, Texas Walmart posted an anti-immigrant, racist screed on 8chan, outlining his plan to stop the "Hispanic invasion of Texas."
“I’ve tried to understand so many times why he keeps it going, and I just don’t get it,” Brennan added. “After Christchurch, after the Tree of Life shooting, and now after this shooting, they think this is all really funny.”
In response to the shooting, Cloudflare announced they will be ending their services for 8chan.
"In the case of the El Paso shooting, the suspected terrorist gunman appears to have been inspired by the forum website known as 8chan," a company statement read. "Based on evidence we've seen, it appears that he posted a screed to the site immediately before beginning his terrifying attack on the El Paso Walmart killing 20 people."
The shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand and the synagogue shooting in Poway, California as well as the El Paso shooting were all announced on the site minutes before the attacks occurred.

Texto completo: After several hours of downtime, 8chan, the online message board that appears to have been used by the suspect in the El Paso mass shooting to post an anti-immigrant manifesto, was again accessible for a few hours Monday, then back down again.
“8chan is coming back online around the world,” a message on the site read as of 10 a.m. Pacific time. “Shout out to our team working hard in the background to restore services.”
Sunday night, 8chan said on its Twitter account that it would be down for the next 24 to 48 hours after Cloudflare dropped it as a customer. San Francisco-based Cloudflare provides support against denial-of-service attacks on websites, so its move opened up 8chan to attacks that could take the site offline.
Calling 8chan a “cesspool of hate,” Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said in a blog post: “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths.”
The suspect in Saturday’s El Paso shooting that killed 22 people and injured more than 20 others, 21-year-old Patrick Crusius, is believed to have posted on 8chan a screed titled “The Inconvenient Truth,” in which he rails against immigrants and said the rampage was meant as a response to an “invasion” of Hispanics into Texas. The writing praises the suspect in another mass shooting who posted an anti-Muslim manifesto on 8chan: the man who carried out the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, which killed 51 people.
The suspect in the Poway synagogue shooting in April, in which one person died and three people were injured, is also believed to have posted a manifesto on 8chan in which he complained about Jewish people.
“What these killers want to do is inspire the next, and 8chan is the place to do that,” said Oren Segal, director of the Center on Extremism at ADL, in an interview Monday.
Segal said he wasn’t surprised that 8chan was back up, and that it would be tough to keep it or similar platforms offline for long. He cited the Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and Gab, a far-right social network, as examples of extremist sites that have persisted online despite running into technical obstacles.
“The reality is that there is a market for this hate and extremism online,” he said.
Prince, the CEO of Cloudflare, said as much in his blog post: “While removing 8chan from our network takes heat off of us, it does nothing to address why hateful sites fester online.”
There were reports that 8chan — which spun out of 4chan after that online message board was deemed to infringe on free speech in the wake of the sexist Gamergate controversy a few years ago — has already switched to a new domain name registrar, and a new host for its site. Epik, which is also known to host Gab, was 8chan’s new host. After public pressure from people such as Alex Stamos, adjunct professor at Stanford University and former Facebook security chief, the company that leased servers to Epik cut it off.
That company, Voxility, said Monday on Twitter in response to Stamos and others who announced its ties to Epik: “We are all in the same team here! Thank you for the support and for the notes. The 3rd party hoster is blocked completely.”
Fredrick Brennan, creator of 8chan, told media outlets including the New York Times that he stopped working with 8chan’s current owner last year.
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the Times. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it.”
Brennan told the Washington Post that 8chan’s owner, Jim Watkins, makes little money from the site. Watkins, a U.S. military veteran and web entrepreneur who now lives in the Philippines, would not comment to the Washington Post.
In a press conference Monday, President Donald Trump, whose racist rhetoric is being blamed for inciting violence against immigrants, said, “We must shine light on the dark recesses of the internet and stop mass murders before they start. The perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored.”
Trump has repeatedly spoken of immigrants “invading” the United States.
“According to Facebook’s ad archive, Trump has run around 2,200 FB ads since May 2018 mentioning the word ‘invasion’,” tweeted Natalie Martinez, researcher for Media Matters for America. “Scrolling through, all of them seem to be about immigration.”

New front in trade war thumps US markets

Texto completo: The news on Monday morning was especially unsettling: Tensions rising in the Persian Gulf over oil shipments, Hong Kong partially paralyzed by antigovernment protests, mass shootings in Texas and Ohio “shaking a bewildered nation to its core," as The New York Times headline blared.
But the development that really rattled investors — at one point sending the Dow Jones average tumbling nearly 1,000 points — was a decline by China's currency against the US dollar. The Dow ended the day with a loss of 767 points, or 2.90 percent, the biggest percentage decline of the year.
The ups and downs of the renminbi usually go little noticed outside the foreign exchange market. But these days, investors' primal fear is that the escalating trade war with China will trip the US economy into a recession.
Can you blame them?
Last week, President Trump said he would impose new tariffs on a huge basket of Chinese goods starting Sept. 1, and US stocks had their worst week of the year.
On Monday, after China let its tightly managed currency hit the lowest level against the dollar since 2008, it sure seemed like retaliation for Trump's new tariff threat.
A cheaper renminbi serves a dual purpose for Beijing: It makes Chinese exports less expensive for international buyers, easing the impact of American tariffs, and complicates life for US companies as they compete against Chinese rivals.
For good measure, China also stopped making purchases of US agricultural goods, which the Trump administration has been seeking to boost.
Then, after the markets closed Monday, the Treasury Department ratcheted up the dispute further, labeling China a currency manipulator.
Deep into July, stocks had been trading at record highs, thanks to hopes for a trade deal, which seemed possible as recently as a week ago. Now the two sides have entered a new, more dangerous phase of the confrontation: currency warfare.
“The response of the equity markets over the last several days to the reignition of protectionist trade policy by the Trump administration toward China has been incredibly negative, and not without reason," Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at wealth manager Boston Private, said in an e-mail. “The economic impact of this potential next round of tariffs could be meaningful, as the goods subject to the next round are consumer focused."
In March of last year, Trump tweeted “trade wars are good, and easy to win."
That was early in his attempt to close the trade gap with China and end unfair tactics such as requiring transfers of US technology to Chinese partners. While most investors and economists dismissed the president's tweet as nonsense, they agreed China's trade practices were a problem that needed to be addressed.
The $200 billion worth of tariffs Trump ordered in July 2018 targeted goods mostly used by companies to make other products. But last week, after a brief round of talks yielded no progress, Trump announced a 10 percent levy on $300 billion of Chinese products, everything from sneakers to cellphones. He made the move despite opposition from some top advisers, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The reaction on Wall Street was overwhelmingly negative. The economy isn't growing as fast as it was when the trade spat started. There is less room for error — a fact acknowledged by the Federal Reserve last week when it approved a quarter-point rate cut as insurance against damage from the trade fight.
“Tariffs are taxes; it is as simple as that," said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Delaware-based Wilmington Trust. “Raising taxes reduces economic growth, just as the tax cut package boosted growth in 2018. . . . First-order impacts of the tariffs wipe out a substantial portion of the tax stimulus that had been created."
So what happened on Monday?
China allowed its tightly managed currency to fall below 7 renminbi to the dollar, a symbolically important move that could make US products even less competitive against Chinese rivals. The president accused China of deliberately weakening its currency to gain an edge in export markets. China blamed Trump for “unilateralism and trade protectionism."
Investors just ran for the hills. A weaker renminbi could prompt other exports-dependent countries to devalue their currencies, leading to a race to the bottom that causes a global recession.
Stocks fell sharply at the opening bell — at one point, the Dow was down more than 960 points. When the dust settled, the market closed at 25,718, 6 percent below its recent record. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 3 percent to 2,845. Stocks also tumbled in Europe, Japan, and China.
“The escalation dashes any hopes of a trade deal any time soon," said Milton Ezrati, chief economist at financial communications firm Vested. “It also makes more immediate and severe the damage this dispute will have on the US economy."
The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to fell to 1.714 percent, the lowest since before Trump's election and a giant red flag that bond investors see increasing odds of a recession. In a switch from last week, investors are betting the Fed will cut rates several more times this year in hopes of avoiding a hard landing.
Then came the formal US declaration that it considers China a currency manipulator, a largely symbolic move that nonetheless escalated the fight once more. S&P futures markets slid in early Asian trading for Tuesday.
There are benefits to falling interest rates: mortgages and credit card borrowing are cheaper for consumers, and businesses can get cheaper loans for expansion. And some investors aren't convinced a downturn is inevitable.
“We have the power to outspend, certainly in the near-term, any adverse effects from China," said Jason R. Escamilla, chief executive of ImpactAdvisor LLC, a San Francisco-based financial adviser. “And I am less concerned that the net effect of all this will be higher new tariffs over the longer term. It's too easy to cut a mutually beneficial deal as this escalates."
That's true. If Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping can step back from the abyss, they would take a lot of pressure off their economies and financial markets. But that's a big if.
“What will happen as a strong-willed US president tries to face down a small cabal of 'hard to read' leaders [in China?]" said Warren Ward, founder of Warren Ward Associates, a financial advisory firm in Columbus, Ind. “No one knows."
Markets hate uncertainty. Expect more ugly days like Monday until the trade picture gets a lot clearer.

Chalking tires a no-no, but city digital since '14

Texto completo: Getting There
In some American cities, the savvy motorist can examine their tires and rest assured they can continue parking - over the allotted time, illegally and free from the fear of a ticket.
This is the not-so-secret way to avoid a fine. In many communities, parking enforcers comb the streets with a long-handled chalk holder, clandestinely marking tires in hidden locations where the unaware driver may miss it. On their next go-around, if a car hadn't moved in the time parking was allowed, a ticket is written up and stuck on the windshield.
Turns out, chalking tires is illegal, according to a ruling in case from Saginaw, Michigan, that could have national implications.
It starts in 2012, when the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that police had violated the rights of a man named Antoine Jones after attaching a GPS device to his car - without a warrant - and tracking his movements for four weeks. Some of the justices thought the surveillance measure had gone too far and violated Jones' privacy rights. Five of the justices, however, said the issue had more to do with trespassing. In other words, the cops shouldn't have touched Jones' car.
Fast-forward a few years to Saginaw, and the case of Alison Taylor, who had gotten 14 parking tickets in three years, all of them written by one officer, according to a story in the New York Times.
She paired up with some attorneys and sued. In 2017, she lost when a trial court sided with the city, saying that chalking was indeed a search, but it was a reasonable one. Police, the judge ruled, are in the business of "community caretaking," and therefore have the authority to enforce parking rules. They can even tow cars.
Taylor appealed, and her case ended up before a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.
As Governing magazine reported recently, the appellate panel used the Supreme Court ruling as precedent to declare tire chalking in Saginaw as unconstitutional. In short, the three judges found that chalking violates the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. In other words, the parking cop shouldn't have touched Taylor's car, even with his long-handled chalk holder.
"There has been a trespass in this case because the city made intentional physical contact" with vehicles, according to the ruling. Enforcing parking limits is not a matter of public safety, but simply a way of raising revenue, the judges said. With that, they agreed with Taylor "because we chalk this practice up to a regulatory exercise, rather than a community-caretaking function."
The city of Saginaw is appealing the decision, but at this point chalking is illegal in a handful of states. But how does it affect Spokane? In this case, Spokane is ahead of the curve.
"We don't chalk tires anymore, haven't for some time," said Marlene Feist, the city's spokeswoman. "We sometimes take photos of cars to document them if we need to."
The city upgraded from chalk in 2014, when it equipped a Ford Focus with a digital license plate reader to prowl the streets looking for parking scofflaws. This high-tech surveillance isn't afoul of the appellate court decision because there's no physical touching of the vehicle involved. Just high-tech surveillance.
Andrew Rolwes, vice president of public policy and parking at the Downtown Spokane Partnership, said the license plate readers are a good way to modernize the city's parking system, and noted that a recent parking study, done by the transportation consultant company Nelson\Nygaard, suggested expanding the use of the technology. The City Council voted last month to put $240,000 toward enacting the study's suggestions.
Rolwes is right. The study encourages the city to "purchase additional License Plate Recognition equipment to support the city's use of digital permits and license plate-based payments including mobile payment and pay stations. LPR will also increase parking enforcement efficiencies and parker compliance in loading zones and at meters with time limits by utilizing digital chalking."
Before "digital chalking" gets your blood up, realize it's part and parcel of the city's effort to make parking less confusing and frustrating. There's plenty of parking in the city core - about 37,000 parking spaces in total. Managing those spaces - which are a mishmash of city-owned, privately owned, on- and off-street spaces - in a thoughtful, centralized way should make it better.
Regardless, some people still argue that parking should be free because, well, it's free at NorthTown or Spokane Valley Mall, why not downtown?
Rolwes has an answer for that.
"On-street parking is intended to be a convenience in a dense downtown, especially a downtown with a strong restaurant and retail sector component," Rolwes said. "The spaces close to your coffee shops, restaurants, hotels - those spaces should turn over so the people that want access to those businesses can get there. It serves the businesses quite well to have on-street parking."
Seattle, Portland deadliest
in years; Spokane stays steady
The Seattle Times reported last month that 2019 has been the deadliest year for pedestrians in Seattle since 2010. During the first half of the year, 101 people were seriously injured or killed in 98 collisions on Seattle streets.
"Of those crashes, 10 were fatal. Five people were killed while in a car, truck or on a motorcycle; four were killed while walking and one while riding a bicycle," wrote Michelle Baruchman for the paper's Traffic Lab.
In Portland, Willamette Week reported that a motorcycle crash July 25 at Northeast 82nd Avenue and Northeast Alderwood Road near Portland International Airport was the 34th traffic-related death in the city - matching the number of deaths for all of 2018.
The roads in the two largest U.S. cities in the Pacific Northwest are the most dangerous they have been in recent years. But how safe are the streets of Spokane?
They can be deadly, but nothing like what's happening to the west.
During the first six months of this year, there were 44 crashes involving 66 vehicles that led to death or serious injury in the city of Spokane. Three people died. Halfway through the year, we were about halfway to the numbers in 2018, when the city experienced 80 crashes involving 120 vehicles that led to serious injury or death. Seven people were killed.
So far this year, five of the crashes were the result of drunken driving. Two involved driving under the influence of drugs. Seven involved speeding. Nine involved inattentive drivers. Ten involved young motorists between the ages of 16 and 25. Seven involved drivers over the age of 70.

Texto completo: My memory flickers a bit dark these days, but clear as a starry night it awakens to Mick dancing in stutter steps across the stage at the Assembly Hall in Champaign, snapping the end of a long crimson scarf behind him with brash flicks of an audacious wrist.
Vivid in my mind, as if it were yesterday, not the half century ago that it was — Nov. 15, 1969, three weeks before Altamont.
The Stones opened with "Jumpin’ Jack Flash." It was a gas, gas, gas.
Such exhilaration, Jagger and the Stones in their prime, soaking them in with a breathtaking sense of bottomless youth. We thought we were going to live the rest of our lives with beaded curtains and bean bag chairs. Far out and outta sight.
I don’t remember what I paid for the tickets. A vintage article from The New York Times serves as a reminder: prices for that Rolling Stones’ tour went for $3 to $8. For perspective, a loaf of bread cost 23 cents, according to mprime.com; a gallon of gas, 32 cents. The Dow ended the year at 839.
My, my, my, my, my. Though the Stones somehow persist, a lot has changed in 50 years.
A while ago, I drove down the street where I grew up. It had been part of a new subdivision when we moved in, shadeless saplings popping almost imperceptibly out of the parkway. Now, they are mighty trees overhanging the street like leafy umbrellas.
A year ago, much was made of 1968 as a benchmark, a time of paisley, protest, turmoil and assassination — the coming of age, presumably, for the Baby Boomer generation.
But for my money, I’ll take 1969.
As with any year, it wasn’t all pretty. The Vietnam War polarized the country. Hearts were stunned or broken by Charles Manson, Chappaquiddick, the Days of Rage, the passings of Everett Dirksen and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the police raid that killed Black Panthers Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in their sleep, the violence at the Altamont Music Festival.
And for Cubs fans, alas, there were the Miracle Mets.
Despite those traumas, what we remember most of 1969 was the wonder, the hope and promise.
Near the top of the charts was "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In," the Fifth Dimension imagining, "... Then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars. This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius."
At the outdoors that year, we took in Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson, "Easy Rider" leading the pack at the box office. At the theaters, too, we could get anything we wanted at "Alice’s Restaurant."
With inspiring eloquence, Maya Angelou touched us with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," her biography of pain, racism and resilience: "The caged bird sings with a fearful trill, of things unknown, but longed for still, and his tune is heard on the distant hill, for the caged bird sings of freedom."
That was the July we gathered around our television sets to watch, breathlessly, in black and white, humanity reach the moon.
"That’s one small step for man," Neil Armstrong said in words no witness will forget, "one giant leap for mankind."
With that surreal step — coming less than a decade from when it had been vowed — we understood that there are no limits to what we can accomplish.
"No dream," Armstrong’s fellow moon walker Buzz Aldrin later wrote, "is too high."
"For one priceless moment in the whole history of man," Richard Nixon told Armstrong and Aldrin in a phone call to the moon, "all the people on the earth are truly one."
Woodstock took place in August on a farm in Bethel, New York, three days of love that came to define a generation.
It was a concert that drew hundreds of thousands with the lure of peace and music, some of the greatest bands to ever play, no small amount of marijuana and hallucinogens.
A documentary movie by the same name played a large role in cementing the festival’s place in history. As it makes clear, the gathering was one filled with good intentions and, in retrospect, a good bit of naivetÃ© as well.
"Over the years, Woodstock got glorified and romanticized and became the event that symbolized Utopia," Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee said in interviews to promote his movie "Taking Woodstock" in 2009. "It’s the last page of our collective memory of the age of innocence."
Our generation was going to change the world.
In many important ways, we did. Just think of the enormous social, medical and technological advances since 1969, how much stronger our understanding of the universe has grown.
But we didn’t change the world in the fundamental ways we believed we would.
We still have war. Hunger and hatred have not been eradicated. Aquarius remains far from reach.
Too little harmony and understanding. No sympathy and trust abounding.
We relish the images, the memories and the exhilarating nostalgia of 1969.
But clear as a starry night, there still is work ahead — no matter what generation may claim it.
As Mick Jagger told the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s in 2001: "The past is a great place and I don’t want to erase or to regret it, but I don’t want to be its prisoner, either."

Texto completo: The online message board 8chan, which has been linked to three mass shootings in 2019, will be terminated, Cloudfare announced late Sunday night, just hours after the site's founder called for its end.
Cloudfare will cut off services for 8chan at midnight PDT, CEO Matthew Prince said in a statement, though he noted that another network provider could bring 8chan back online. That's what happened in 2017, when Cloudfare booted The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi message board.
"The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths," Prince said. "Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit. "
During media interviews earlier Sunday, 8chan founder Fredrick Brennan called for the imageboard 's end.
El Paso Walmart shooting: Quiet Texas neighborhood stunned by connection to El Paso shooting suspect
“Shut the site down,” Brennan told the New York Times on Sunday. “It’s not doing the world any good. It’s a complete negative to everybody except the users that are there. And you know what? It’s a negative to them, too. They just don’t realize it. ”
Founded as an alternative to the more well-known 4chan message board, 8chan, or "Infinite Chan," has nearly 20,000 public boards. The website's welcome is, "Welcome to 8chan, the Darkest Reaches of the Internet. "
Many of the posts that could be quickly accessed prior to the website's termination included offensive images and language.
Saturday's shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, which left 20 dead and 26 injured, is the latest with a link to the website. The suspected gunman has been charged with capital murder and the crime is being investigated as a possible hate crime after the discovery of a racist manifesto on 8chan.
In March, a New Zealand man posted a lengthy manifesto to Twitter and to 8chan before killing 50 and injuring dozens in a rampage that was live-streamed on Facebook and Twitter.
In April, a shooter posted a manifesto to 8chan before killing one woman and injuring three others at a California synagogue.
The New York Times reported 8chan, "remained on the fringes until 2014, when some supporters of GamerGate — a loose reactionary collection of anti-feminist video gamers — flocked to 8chan after being kicked off 4chan.
By Sunday evening, the shooter's alleged manifesto was still circulating on 8chan.
A 'venomous' website for 'extremist hate'
In interviews with the Washington Post and the New York Times, Brennan said 8chan needs to be shut down. He gave up control of the website to Army veteran Jim Watkins in 2015, both newspapers reported.
“The board is a receptive audience for domestic terrorists," Brennan told the Post.
The Washington Post called the website "one of the Web’s most venomous refuges for extremist hate. "
One anonymous 8chan user, for example, praised the El Paso shooting in a thread, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a news release.
“The motive and the manifesto have not been named the entire day. There weren’t even speculations. They are f------ SCARED. ”
'But this isn't the end'
In a message at the top of its website, 8chan states, "only content that violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or other United States laws is deleted," from the imageboard and warns users that posts and boards are user-created and "do not represent the opinions of the 8chan administration. "
Brennan told the Post that 8chan is a "vanity project" for Watkins that doesn't make much money. He also told the newspaper the website's servers are distributed around the world, which makes it difficult to take down.
It has also been protected from web-based attacks by Cloudflare, according to the Post. Cloudflare lawyer Douglas Kramer told the Post he worried dropping 8chan's protection would encourage "cyber vigilantism. "
In its termination statement, Cloudfare said it feels uncomfortable "playing the role of content arbitrator" but called on technology companies to work with lawmakers on dealing with hate-filled sites.
"There comes a time when enough is enough," Prince said in a tweet with the termination statement. "But this isn't the end. We need to have a broader conversation about addressing the root causes of hate online. "

Texto completo: El heroísmo de un guardia de seguridad evitó que la masacre de Dayton, Ohio, el domingo en la madrugada tuviera un mayor número de muertos.
James Williams, dueño de una pizzería vecina al bar Ned Peppers , donde ocurrió la tragedia, dijo al New York Times que en la escena se conoció que el guardia de seguridad evitó que el pistolero ingresara al club. La acción evitó un escenario como el del club Pulse en Orlando ya que la pista de baile del bar es lo primero que se ve al entrar.
El guardia sufrió lesiones por esquirlas, pero se recupera satisfactoriamente. Nueve personas murieron y 16 fueron heridas.
We need to thank the heroics of the bouncer at the door of @nedpeppersbar.
From what I'm bring told, he stopped Connor Betts from entering the bar enabling Dayton Police to drop him.
The unamed bouncer recieved injuries from shrapnel and was taken to hospital#DaytonShooting

Williams y otros hombres acudieron a la escena cuando dejaron de sonar los disparos. El comerciante dijo que era como una escena de la Segunda Guerra Mundial , con cuerpos desangrando a lado y lado. Su cinturón sirvió de torniquete.
El tirador fue identificado como Connor Betts, de 24 años. El sujeto habría disparado con un fusil de asalto ya que la munición era calibre .223 y su ataque ocurrió en un minuto.
Fue la segunda masacre en menos de 24 horas en el país. El sábado un individuo mató a 20 personas en un Walmart de El Paso, Texas.

Don the Beachcomber Mai Tai Festival on Hawaii island celebrates the cocktail

Texto completo: Hawaii’s allure is due in part to the mai tai, a rum-based cocktail that actually traces its beginnings to California Today, there are as many versions of it as there are bars and restaurants that serve it — hundreds worldwide.
In 2009, Gary Hogan, president of Hawaiian Hotels & Resorts, came up with the idea of launching a festival spotlighting the ubiquitous drink that has become synonymous with the islands. Held at the company’s Royal Kona Resort on Hawaii island, the Don the Beachcomber Mai Tai Festival is expected to draw some 2,000 people this year.
“Gary’s vision was to create a fun, exciting multifaceted event,” said Jeff Isbister, the hotel’s director of food and beverage, who has helped plan and implement the festival since its inception. “We came up with a successful concept and haven’t veered from it.”
The celebration opens with the Battle of the BBQ, during which Tavana will perform his island-­inspired rock-and-blues music. Ten Hawaii island chefs — including entrants from Umeke’s, Broke da Mouth Grindz and Roy’s Waikoloa Bar & Grill — will compete for world’s best barbecue bragging rights and the people’s choice and judge’s choice awards.
“The dishes can be beef, pork, seafood, chicken, pretty much anything,” Isbister said. “Sampler plates will be available for purchase using scrip. We’ll collect and count the scrip for each entry, and that’s how we’ll determine who will get the people’s choice award. It’s reasonable to think if people really like a dish, they’ll keep going back for more of it.”
Winners will receive a five-night stay at the Royal Kona Resort’s sister property, the Royal Lahaina Resort at Maui’s Kaanapali Beach Resort, including airfare, luau admission and a round of golf for two, plus a $ 500 resort food and beverage credit.
After the barbecue contest, cool off at a pool party with a cocktail and a swim. For two hours, the pool will be open to all festival attendees, not just Royal Kona guests, and there will be music by multiple Na Hoku Hanohano award winner Henry Kapono and his band.
“Henry performed solo at our first festival,” Isbister said. “He brought his band the next year, and they’ve participated every year since then. When they start playing, that’s the only time I stop running around, so I can listen to a few songs.”
By late afternoon, everyone is revved up for the Mai Tai Mix-Off Competition. This year, 21 professional bartenders representing bars, hotels and restaurants from as far away as Cleveland, New Jersey, Pittsburgh and Toronto will compete for top honors and cash prizes (the first-place winner will receive $ 10,000; second place, $ 5,000; and third place, $ 2,500).
Three bartenders will be on stage at a time. They’ll have 10 minutes to complete their drink, which will be judged on appearance, aroma, creativity, taste and proficiency of the bartender.
“Taste is the most important factor, so contestants can pick up the most points in that category,” ­Isbister said. “Creativity and appearance are also key because that’s what sells drinks. Some of the bartenders make their own syrups from scratch, and it’s amazing to see the effort that goes into the presentations. One year, a bartender set up a beach scene on each judge’s serving tray with sand, sunglasses and headphones, so they could listen to Hawaiian music as they tasted his mai tai.”
On this year’s panel of judges is renowned Hawaii chef Sam Choy; Shawn Ford, a consultant with Paramount Network’s “Bar Rescue” television show, which helps struggling bars turn into profitable businesses; and author, restaurateur and master mixologist Jeff “Beachbum” Berry. A New York Times article hailed Berry as “the Indiana Jones of tiki drinks.”
“Beachbum Berry is a walking encyclopedia of tiki culture, which is what comes to mind when people dream of their idyllic tropical escape,” Isbister said. “It’s beaches; sunshine; palm trees; beautiful sunsets; a warm, blue ocean; and a colorful cocktail with a fresh flower, umbrella and chunk of pineapple on the rim of the glass. That’s the magic of the mai tai. When you think of the mai tai, you think of Hawaii.”

THE ORIGIN OF THE MAI TAI
Although the mai tai has become as much a symbol of ­Hawaii as the hula, surfing and Diamond Head, it actually was born in California. That is certain. Beyond that, however, a bit of controversy arises.
One story anoints Donn Beach — a noted chef, world traveler and savvy businessman who first found success in Hollywood — as the creator of the world-­famous cocktail. Another says the honor should be bestowed on Victor Bergeron, founder of the Trader Vic’s empire based in Concord, Calif., which now operates 17 restaurants around the world, including Japan, England, Thailand, Germany, Qatar, Bahrain and the Seychelles.
Rivals who respected each other’s accomplishments, Beach and Bergeron bickered about the origin of the mai tai for decades, and since both have passed away (Bergeron in 1984; Beach in 1989), the whole truth probably never will be known.
Some suggest both restaurateurs should be credited for the birth of the Aloha State’s best-selling libation.

Texto completo: Here's when we'll know the future came and went: Nostalgic songs about listening to the radio will be long dead, and in their place, romantics will sing about the sublime pleasures of listening to music on YouTube.
If that sounds weird, go ask someone younger than you how they listen to their favorite songs. That's what I do whenever I'm invited to speak to a group of high school students, and for the past five years, I've gotten the same answer: YouTube is the go-to spot and it isn't even close.
Not Spotify, not Apple Music, not SoundCloud. Definitely not Tidal, Pandora or Amazon. For young listeners, YouTube is their radio (widely accessible), their record store (awesomely vast), their MTV (partly retinal), their Walkman (completely portable), their iTunes (on demand), their online message board (comments abound) - all in one place. And the numbers bear it out. One billion visitors come to YouTube for music each month, according to Google. What a bizarre triumph for a company so eager to obsolesce our televisions. As the streaming wars rage into the future, a site that never really intended to become a music platform accidentally became our most visited, most variegated music platform.
That means we can't think of YouTube just as a business. We need to think of it as a listening experience.
Many musical encounters on YouTube begin with curiosity. Type some keywords into the search bar, listen to what you came for, then allow the algorithm to whisk you off to wherever it chooses. You pick the starting point, then you float. Get bored, start over. All the while, YouTube's Google-powered algorithm is trying to figure out your tastes, even when it's pushing you toward things other than music.
Say your starting point is the new Rosalía single. On other music-streaming services, you'll find that song lined up neatly next to other Rosalía cuts, and other pop-hits-en-Español like it. But on YouTube, where recommendations can be shaped by your search history, that same song gets to live within a few clicks of a plumbing tutorial, an Ali Wong joke, Robert Mueller's congressional testimony, and handheld video footage of a duck and a kitten that are friends. In that sense, YouTube situates a piece of music, and the listening experience, in the greater context of all media, all experience: maintaining a toilet, maintaining a family, maintaining a democracy, maintaining an optimistic view of interspecies companionship.
It's easy to get dizzy in that drift. YouTube is vast and messy, full of distractions, and so it asks something of you that the more silo-like music-streaming services do not. Listening to music on YouTube's main site requires true engagement. To get the most from it, you need focus, endurance, a sense of adventure - the virtues of good listening.
At the 2018 South By Southwest music and technology conference, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said, "We're really more like a library." That's a cute idea, but YouTube doesn't feel like a library. It's too chaotic, too unpredictable, too full of trapdoors and secret gardens, stuff you didn't know you could find and stuff you may wish you hadn't.
What YouTube really feels like is the world.
One reason it feels like the world is because more of the world is in there. YouTube isn't just an A.V. jukebox loaded with industry-manufactured studio recordings. It's a user-generated content platform, which means it's brimming with bootlegs, outtakes, live performances, interviews and more. The sound quality is all over the place, and so is the music. YouTube has Marvin Gaye singing the national anthem at the NBA Finals, and Joni Mitchell playing the dulcimer on the BBC, and live performance footage of hundreds of hardcore bands blasting through VHS hiss.
The rarest gems to materialize on-screen can't be excavated in a used record store. I'll always remember the thrill of landing on a swatch of camcorder footage featuring the California rapper Suga Free making casual magic in an undisclosed dining room circa 1995. It remains one of the most enthralling rap performances I've ever heard. Or seen. With glossy rhymes evaporating off his tongue, Suga Free bangs out an intricate beat on a tabletop with nothing other than his palms, a nickel and a ballpoint pen. To truly hear it, you need to see it.
What's great is that I never searched for this song. I didn't know it existed. But YouTube, having kept its all-seeing eye on me for so many years, knew that I loved '90s gangsta rap from Los Angeles and suspected that I might like Suga Free's dining-table act. Presto. When YouTube's algorithmic autoplay function highlighted the video in the "Up Next" sidebar on my computer screen, it felt like some kind of prize. Scouring YouTube for music and floating through it are two very different things, but the harder you search, the better you float.
That doesn't mean you'll find treasure at the end of every rainbow. The suggestions made by "Up Next" are responsible for more than 70 percent of the time users spend on the site - a fact that appeared in a recent New York Times story about how white nationalists are being radicalized on YouTube. The company says it's cracking down on hateful content, but for many years, YouTube had no problem funneling users into its most toxic corners in the name of engagement.
No wonder YouTube is trying to brand itself as a library. Parents don't worry about their music-obsessed children getting lost in the library; they worry about them getting lost online - the same way they might worry about them getting lost in a musical nightlife populated with shady strangers. And the shadiest stranger on YouTube is the algorithm.
Our listening lives have always been shaped by people we don't know, many of them presumably benevolent - the DJs, the music journalists, the record store clerks. But as with any streaming service, YouTube's algorithm seeks to replace those cultural guides.
You watch YouTube while YouTube watches you. It tallies every detail of your Google-owned life, getting to know you better than your music friends do, all in an effort to advertise to your eyes and ears for hours without end. On YouTube, the act of listening itself becomes completely transactional. The algorithm will do anything and everything to make you stay.
Yet, even with all of those alarms going off, I still feel like being able to hear those Suga Free rhymes anytime I want might be worth the annoying pre-roll ads, worth the surveillance, worth the threat of living in a world of automated taste. Recorded music has always existed under the yoke of capitalism, and good listeners have always found ways to elevate their listening above the noise of the sales floor. Mainstream radio and MTV used to be these odious industry forces, but nowadays, we seem to miss the comforting gravitational pull of the monoculture they once embodied. As insidious as YouTube can be, we'll mourn it someday.
For now, it's important to remember that when it comes to music, the container usually changes what's inside. The vinyl platter gave us the idea that pop stars should be auteurs who present their ideas a dozen songs a swoop. Cassettes gave listeners the power to copy, curate and circulate their favorite sounds. Compact discs gave us longer swaths of clear, uninterrupted muchness.
Is it even possible to think of YouTube as a container? It has no discernible limits, so its contours don't impose any particular pressure on the music that fills it. Instead, the limit is our time. Other music-streaming services are mindful of our time. They want users to feel safe in the paralyzing immensity of what they have on offer, so they provide a deep menu of comfort-zone playlists designed to reinforce our tastes. Not YouTube. It promises horizons.
This has to be why teenage listeners keep pointing their ears toward YouTube's sonic sprawl. When you're young, the world feels impossibly big. If you're not worried about how much time you have left to hear it, searching and floating can feel like the same thing.

Texto completo: Students of Covington High School in Kentucky have filed a defamation suit against several members of the media who made disparaging remarks about the teens earlier this year.
The suit lists several well-known journalists and television personalities, including CNN analyst Ana Navarro and New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman.
The Kentucky teens were widely criticized in January when a D.C. field trip to attend the March for Life turned into a face-off with a Native American protester. Early assumptions made by the media that the teens were antagonizing the protester were later disproved as more video of the interaction showed the teens to not be aggressors.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Deb Haaland, comedian Kathy Griffin, and Matthew Dowd of ABC News are also named in the suit.
Tweet
"Several of our Senators, most-famous celebrities, and widely read journalists, collectively used their large social media platforms, perceived higher credibility and public followings to lie and libel minors they never met, based on an event they never witnessed," a statement from the teens' lawyer said. "These defendants called for the kids to be named and shamed, doxxed and expelled, and invited public retaliation against these minors from a small town in Kentucky."
"The defendants circulated false statements about them to millions of people around the world," the statement continued, "The video of the entire event, known to the defendants, exposed all of their factual claims against the kids as lies. The defendants were each individually offered the opportunity to correct, delete, and/or apologize for their false statements, but each refused, continuing to circulate the false statements about these children to this very day on their social media platforms they personally control."
A defamation suit filed by the students against the New York Times was dismissed last week.

Fortnite Star To Leave Twitch

Texto completo: Tyler Blevins, the 28-year-old multimillionaire and a popular face of Fortnite, announced on Thursday that he would be leaving Twitch, the largest streaming platform for gamers, for the Microsoft-owned platform Mixer.
Mr. Blevins, better known to millions of gamers as Ninja, posted a video announcement on Twitter just four days after a 16-year-old won $ 3 million at the Fortnite World Cup.
"I know this may come as a shock to many of you, but as of today I will be streaming exclusively on Mixer," Mr. Blevins said in the video. "I feel like this is a really good chance to get back in touch with my roots and really remember why I fell in love with streaming in the first place."
"It's the same me, just a different platform," he added.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mixer, originally called Beam, was acquired by Microsoft in 2016 and renamed in 2017.
Niles Heron, an executive at Loaded, Mr. Blevins's management company, declined to comment on how much Mr. Blevins was being paid as part of the deal, but said that "the decision was overwhelmingly not driven by the monetary value."
Mr. Heron said the opportunity to attract new viewers was a consideration in Mr. Blevins's move. Mixer, with its direct connection to Xbox -- both are owned by Microsoft -- has a generally more youthful audience because younger gamers are more likely to play on consoles than personal computers, he said.
"It was clear that it was the right time to open new doors that let Tyler define his lane," Mr. Heron said. "Xbox is the dominant console of the day and Windows is the platform of Halo, the first game he played as a professional gamer. It made a lot of sense."
Twitch wished Mr. Blevins luck in his future endeavors. "We've loved watching Ninja over the years and are proud of all that he's accomplished for himself and his family, and the gaming community," the company said in a statement.
Mixer said in a statement: "We're thrilled to welcome Ninja and his community to Mixer. Mixer is a place that was formed around being positive and welcoming from day one, and we look forward to the energy Ninja and his community will bring."
With more than 14 million followers, Mr. Blevins has the widest reach of any Twitch user. The next most-followed gamer has less than half that amount.
Mr. Blevins began his professional video game career playing Halo 3 in 2009 and, two years later, started streaming on Twitch. He started streaming his Fortnite game play in 2017. By the end of that year, his follower count had exploded alongside the game's popularity.
In March 2018, Mr. Blevins incited controversy when he uttered a racial slur while mouthing along to a Logic song. Months later, he was the subject of further public outcry after saying that "I don't play with female gamers" out of respect for his wife.
Last year, he told The New York Times that he played Fortnite Battle Royale, the popular fight-to-the-death video game, for 10 hours every day, streaming to fans and responding to questions. If he stopped playing for even an hour, he said, he could lose up to 300 followers.
Mr. Blevins said he earned more than $ 500,000 a month, with Twitch as a primary income source. (Twitch users pay up to $ 24.99 a month for the streaming service, depending on the tier of service.)
Last fall Mixer unveiled new ways for users to support streamers without having to pony up themselves. Under the new system, participation in a channel, including actions as small as posting a GIF, could be converted to real payouts for streamers like Mr. Blevins.
In Fortnite Battle Royale, the game Mr. Blevins is most closely associated with, up to 100 players are dropped onto a virtual island. The players fight until only one remains. The game has nearly 250 million registered players, according to its publisher, Epic Games.
On Sunday, the Fortnite World Cup was held at the 23,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, in Queens. The stadium was sold out through the weekend for the competition.
"I'm freaking out in the best ways," Mr. Blevins said in another video posted to Twitter on Thursday. "I love you guys and obviously the streams are just going to be the exact same. So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys on the platform."
Dakotaz, a Twitch user with nearly four million followers, offered his support on Twitter.
"Honestly bro streamer to streamer," he said, "I respect the courage this took to switch."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Dean &amp; DeLuca Sinks Further Into Debt

Texto completo: Dean & DeLuca, the debt-ridden global chain of luxury food shops, has defaulted on federally mandated payments to former employees and stalled payments to current employees in the United States, according to accounts from employees and documents received by The New York Times.
The parent company, Pace Development in Bangkok, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In recent weeks, four Dean & DeLuca cafes have closed, including Stage, the company's expensive new showpiece in Manhattan's fashionable Meatpacking district; it had been open for just three months. Only four stores are left in the United States, and nearly bare shelves are stocked with supermarket products rather than the delicacies the chain relied on to build its brand. (When Pace bought Dean & DeLuca in 2014, there were more than 40 locations in the United States.) The Wichita Eagle also reported that there were layoffs this week at the company's American headquarters in Wichita, Kan. And The San Francisco Chronicle reported that laid-off workers from the shuttered store in the Napa Valley, who have not received final payouts, are considering a class-action lawsuit against the company.
However, this week the chain's Bangkok-based owner, Sorapoj Techakraisri, was touting the chain's growth in Asia and the Middle East, where the company has about 70 stores, many of them licensed franchises. According to Retail News Asia, he said at a press conference that 90 more stores in Thailand would open in the next five years, and that the brand would be launched in five more Asian capitals. About the American stores, he said, "We are adjusting the Dean & DeLuca business to a more appropriate size by controlling expenditures both at its office and stores."
Meanwhile, United States vendors of artisanal baguettes, smoked fish, hot sauce, chocolates and more, owed hundreds of thousands of dollars, have cut off the chain's credit. According to multiple employees, both former and current, landlords served eviction notices at two New York stores that have now closed, citing hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid rent. One former employee, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation by the company, said that the laundry service had stopped delivering clean uniforms, so workers were competing to grab the least-soiled jackets from the previous shift.
Now it seems those employees will also be paying for the chain's financial collapse.
Although the chain has been in financial free fall for months, Mr. Sorapoj, the wealthy scion of a prominent Thai real-estate family, said through a representative last month that current employees would continue to be paid. However, weekly paychecks have repeatedly been delayed, including on Friday, when employees said they were told they would instead receive checks on Monday.
Mr. Sorapoj also reiterated that the approximately 180 former employees who lost their jobs in July when the stores closed would be "taken care of." (The store in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., closed on Aug. 1.) Letters sent to those employees at the time told them that they would be paid in compliance with the 1988 federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (or the WARN Act). The act requires large employers to compensate workers who lose their jobs when a business closes with less than 60 days' notice. Employees of the St. Helena, Calif., Upper East Side and Stage stores were told that they would receive compensation for up to 10 weeks of workdays, all unused vacation days, benefit deductions, retirement fund deductions and final paychecks.
But this week, the same employees received a letter acknowledging that the company would not be making those payments "because it is a faltering company and due to unforeseeable circumstances." It also states that Dean & DeLuca is no longer being funded by its parent company and that the owner made a recent attempt to sell the business, which was fruitless.
The language of the letter indicates that the company plans to claim that the closing does not fall under the WARN Act, which in 2017 was modified to make exceptions for employers who can prove that the closing is due to natural disaster or unforeseeable business circumstances, and who have made a good faith effort to procure funding.
Those employees were directed to address any future questions to an in-house attorney in Wichita. Phone calls to the number provided in the letter go directly to voicemail.

Texto completo: Quentin Tarantino's Charles Manson-adjacent movie, "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood," has resurfaced the story of a man who has fascinated and horrified America since he and his "family's" murder spree in 1969. Here's what to read if you want to learn more about Manson and his crimes.
'The Girls' by Emma Cline (2016)
This book, inspired by the group of mostly women that made up the Manson family, "is a seductive and arresting coming-of-age story hinged on Charles Manson, told in sentences at times so finely wrought they could almost be worn as jewelry," wrote our reviewer. "It reimagines the summer leading up to the notorious Tate-LaBianca murders in Los Angeles in August 1969, and it dissects an obsession -- but not the one you'd expect."
'The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's Dune Buggy Attack Battalion' by Ed Sanders (1971)
Sanders, who was a poet, a member of the band The Fugs and a columnist for The Los Angeles Free Press, wrote the first definitive story of the Manson murders, published while Manson was still on trial. Sanders did extensive research and embedded himself with the Manson family to tell this story. His narrative "is almost compulsively free of what in a more literal context he refers to as 'horse dooky.' He refuses to philosophize, psychoanalyze or make excuses," wrote our reviewer, adding that Sanders's book is "truer and more exciting for it."
'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' by Vincent Bugliosi with Curt Gentry (1974)
Bugliosi was the Los Angeles prosecutor responsible for putting Manson behind bars, and this true crime book focuses on the particulars of the case and the investigation, as well as Bugliosi's salient contribution: dredging up a motive. Manson's, he deduced, was to start a sort of race war, which he called "Helter Skelter." The writers' telling "is rendered, appropriately enough, in the language of a D.A.: methodical, tight, occasionally ironical and rising to emotional pitch only on rare occasion," wrote our reviewer. "Oddly, though, the manner of telling works."
'Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson' by Jeff Guinn (2013)
This book unveils fresh details about Manson's childhood and teenage years, while also exploring Manson's criminality, the 1960s music industry and the general ambience of the decade. The result "stands as a definitive work: important for students of criminology, human behavior, popular culture, music, psychopathology and sociopathology, and compulsively readable for anyone who relishes nonfiction," our reviewer wrote.
'Chaos: Charles Manson, the C.I.A. and the Secret History of the Sixties' by Tom O'Neill with Dan Piepenbring (2019)
This latest book about Manson, 20 years in the making, "is less a definitive account of the murders than a kaleidoscope swirl of weird discoveries and mind-bending hypotheticals that reads like Raymond Chandler after a tab of windowpane," wrote a reporter for The Times who recently interviewed O'Neill about the book. "Chaos" disputes the popular view that Manson's motive was to start a race war. "The Manson family intersected with a multitude of shady characters at so many levels -- law enforcement, drug trafficking, even the government, all wiped from the record," O'Neill told The Times, "that I found good reason to doubt that the Helter Skelter motive was the full story, or even the real story."

Texto completo: BAGHDAD - As a boy, Hamza bin Laden appeared in propaganda films for al-Qaida, the terrorist group led by his father, Osama. He preached jihad, trained with fighters and was introduced as a voice of al-Qaida, "a young lion to carry forth the cause."
But much of his story remains shrouded in mystery. And when U.S. officials announced Wednesday that the younger bin Laden had been killed in a U.S. strike in the past two years, details about where and how he died were as scarce as information about his life in the shadows.
He was believed to have been about 30 years old.
Bin Laden had been mistakenly pronounced dead before, when officials thought he had died in the U.S. Navy SEAL raid to kill his father. Two years ago, there was also a failed attempt to kill him, according to three officials.
Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies noted on Twitter on Thursday that al-Qaida-affiliated channels on Telegram, the messaging app, had been discussing the reports of bin Laden's death, but there has been no official confirmation or denial from al-Qaida's general command.
After a SEAL team killed Hamza's father in 2011, documents recovered from the hideout in Pakistan showed that Hamza, a favorite of his father, was being groomed for a leadership role in al-Qaida. From a young age he showed a keen interest in joining his father's violent campaign against the United States and its allies.
The younger bin Laden was named a member of al-Qaida in 2014 by his father's successor, Ayman al-Zawahri. The group's leaders saw the young man with the famous name as someone who could attract followers of rival Sunni Islamist groups like the Islamic State.
Hamza vowed vengeance for his father's death, calling for attacks on Western capitals and warning Americans that they would be "targeted in the United States and abroad," according to the State Department.
In a series of audio recordings released by al-Qaida beginning in 2015, Hamza bin Laden called for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and urged Syrian jihadi groups to unite to liberate the Palestinians.
Hamza bin Laden married a daughter of a senior al-Qaida leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah. A video of their wedding was found in the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where his father was killed. His family also told The Guardian in 2018 that he had married the daughter of Mohamed Atta, a mastermind of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but it was not clear when.
In a letter published by al-Qaida in December 2017, Hamza bin Laden said his 12-year-old son had been killed, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. But the circumstances were unclear.

Texto completo: Al Gore will spend three days in the Twin Cities training activists how to talk about environmental degradation, extreme weather and the impact of shifting climate in Minnesota and around the world.
Scientists and politicians are still debating what higher temperatures could mean for Minnesota fisheries, river levels, air quality, ecosystems and everyday quality of life.
Gore, the former vice president who won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for his books and activism around environmental sustainability, is the founder of the Climate Reality Project. It’s a nonprofit that aims to solve the climate crisis through on-the-ground education.
The three-day Leadership Corps training opens at 10 a.m. Friday at the Minneapolis Convention Center, with Gov. Tim Walz scheduled to deliver remarks shortly before 11:30 a.m.
Roughly 30 speakers are expected to take part over the weekend. They include New York Times columnist and Minnesota native Thomas Friedman, geophysicist Henry Pollack, youth activist Lia Harrel and Paul Huttner, chief meteorologist with Minnesota Public Radio.
St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey will speak Sunday morning.
The training will look at how environmental changes are affecting residents of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest as well as economic opportunities presented by shifting to clean energy, environmentally sustainable agriculture and “green” jobs.
Those who complete the conference will be dubbed official members of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps, a network of more than 20,000 activists across six continents and 150 countries.
The Minneapolis training group is full. For information on future programs, visit www.climaterealityproject.org.

Texto completo: What's on TV
A BLACK LADY SKETCH SHOW 11 p.m. on HBO. This new show from the comedian Robin Thede hopes to make history by being able to say something many other shows of its ilk cannot: The cast, the director (Dime Davis) and the writers are all black women. With a handful of sketches each episode and a slew of celebrity guests (including Angela Bassett, Lena Waithe and David Alan Grier), the very funny first season introduces a fake '60s soul group, a divorce party derailed by hallucinogenic mushrooms and a '30s groupie who pursues the baseball star Satchel Paige.
BOY ERASED (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO. In this drama, Lucas Hedges plays an Arkansas college student who is sent to a so-called conversion therapy program. Directed by Joel Edgerton and adapted from Garrard Conley's memoir, the film follows Hedges's character, Jared Eamons, as the program he's dispatched to by his parents (played by Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe) becomes progressively more abusive. That's in part a product of the program's leader, Mr. Sykes (Edgerton), a villain with some complicating nuances. "The mood of 'Boy Erased' is not of indictment but of kindness, a virtue that Jared has clearly learned from his mother and father, even if they differ as to its meaning," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The film's sensitivity, though it is an ethical strength, is also a dramatic limitation." In his review, Scott also noted that, when it was released in October, "Boy Erased" was the second major film that year to tackle the subject of conversion therapy. The first, Desiree Akhavan's THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST (2018), airs the same night at 6:25 p.m. on HBO2.
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982) 8 p.m. on BBC America. These days, Sean Penn might be better known for his recent serious roles, like his anguished astronaut in Hulu's "The First," or for hanging out with the drug lord El Chapo. But in the early 1980s, he was ordering a double cheese and sausage pizza in class as the slacker high-school surfer Jeff Spicoli. Directed by Amy Heckerling, it's one of many classic scenes in this coming-of-age comedy, which transcended its own silliness to have an enduring cultural impact.
What's Streaming
DEAR WHITE PEOPLE Stream on Netflix. Justin Simien's satirical comedy revolves around a group of black students at a fictional elite, predominantly white university. Season 3 sees some of them, like Sam (Logan Browning) and Lionel (DeRon Horton), struggling to balance their own ambitions with their longstanding push for change at the school. "I think the show has two goals," Simien told The Times last year. "One is to allow people who don't necessarily look like us to see themselves in characters they don't expect to." And the other, he added, "is to make people who've actually gone through these experiences go: 'Oh my God, totally. I'm so glad someone finally put it that way."'

Hervé Tullet Draws on Simplicity

Texto completo: Hervé Tullet has created over 80 books, perhaps most famously the best-selling, interactive "Press Here , " which invites children to touch and shake its pages. His latest project is "The Ideal Exhibition, " a series of workshops he conducts around the world in which attendees are invited to participate in the art-making process. We spoke at his studio on the top floor of the brownstone he lives in with his family in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.
How long has this been your studio?
Three and a half years. We were preparing to move to New York from Paris, and we had only 10 days to find an apartment to live in, with space for my studio. We wanted to be in Harlem, to be close to my daughter's school. It was hard, but then we found this brownstone. I love it. The wood built-ins are so good, you don't need much furniture.
Your studio space is on the top floor, in what would have been a bedroom. How did you make it ready to work in?
I put a blue tarp on the walls, because I didn't want to spoil the brick. Then I put cardboard on the floor to protect it. You know, I need to not think about stains or anything like that. I have sometimes pretty lively movements, and I had to make it work for that.
Do you like having a studio right in your home?
I've always had to have my studio near where I live. Absolutely. In Paris I had a door to open and I would walk into my apartment.
My studio in Paris was bigger. Sometimes I feel the space here is too small. But then that also makes me feel more free. Because this isn't really my studio -- my studio is in my brain. And so I've always thought, do I need a big studio space, or not? In the past I've ended up thinking no.
What would be the drawback of a big space?
It would be a burden. I love to feel light. My work is really one of ideas: What would happen if I made three dots, one red, one blue, one yellow? You don't need a big studio for that. It's really simple. All that simplicity brings me to lightness. I don't want to have tons of paper around. You can draw with a stick in the sand, at the beach. Maybe one day I'll do a book like that.
It looks like you still spend lots of time playing around with paint.
Sure. But in my work everything is about a simple idea and the energy to project it. My most radical book is "Mix It Up." I just took paint, put it on my finger and put it on the page. That's it. That's what I'm looking for in all my work, that simplicity. I need to make sure the people who get my book can see that I made it with my hand, and I need them to think they are able to do the same. They need to see there is no barrier between the idea and the painting. So you see, the technique is not the most important part. The studio is not the most important part.
And yet you've told me that you just bought a barn in France, for a new studio.
It's true. I bought a barn in Normandy, and I'm going to turn it into a studio. It's the first time I'll have a really big studio with a lot of space for storage. I'll have four work tables, instead of one. But if I had had a big studio before, maybe it would have been a bad thing. Maybe I wouldn't have been able to make my work as simple as it needed to be.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- DoorDash, the food delivery start-up, said Thursday that it was buying Caviar, a rival service, for $ 410 million in a deal that escalates the already intense competition in food delivery.
DoorDash is buying Caviar from Square, the payments company, which has owned the service since 2014. Caviar operates in around 15 cities and primarily offers food from upscale restaurants in urban areas.
Tony Xu, chief executive of DoorDash, said Caviar's selection of higher-end restaurants in cities complemented DoorDash's offerings, which skew more heavily toward chain restaurants in the suburbs. When Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Square, called him about a potential deal, he said, it was a "short conversation."
Postmates, DoorDash, GrubHub and Uber Eats have been locked in an increasingly intense fight for customers, drivers and restaurant clients. The companies have faced intensified scrutiny and attention with the initial public offering of Uber in May and potential I.P.O. of Postmates. In February, Postmates confidentially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but has not set a date for any listing.
DoorDash has embarked on a string of fund-raising. In May, the company raised $ 600 million, lifting its valuation to $ 12.6 billion. The company collected $ 400 million from Temasek and Dragoneer Investment Group in February. In 2018, the company raised $ 785 million from investors.
Mr. Xu said he did not see competition as a hindrance in food delivery because only 7 percent of "non-pizza" food sold in the United States was delivered.
"It's early days in a market that's highly dynamic," he said.
DoorDash recently encountered pushback against its policy of counting tips from customers toward a driver's base pay. After an article in The New York Times described the practice, the company said it had dropped the policy.
"It's a super hard problem that we have to get right," Mr. Xu said. "We're working on striking the right balance."

Texto completo: So you made it through the second set of Democratic debates. Congratulations! Ready to talk about the next ones?
The Democratic National Committee has set stricter criteria for the third set of debates, which will be held on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 in Houston. If 10 or fewer candidates qualify, the debate will take place on only one night.
[ The race is fluid, and other things we learned from the July Democratic debates. ]
Candidates will need to have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four polls. They have until Aug. 28 to reach those benchmarks.
These criteria could easily halve the field: The first two sets of debates included 20 of the 24 candidates, but a New York Times analysis of polls and donor numbers shows that only 10 to 12 candidates are likely to make the third round.
[ When will the Democratic field start to shrink? ]
Seven candidates have already met both qualification thresholds and are guaranteed a spot on stage. They are:
■ Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
■ Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey
■ Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
■ Senator Kamala Harris of California
■ Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas
■ Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont
■ Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts
Three other candidates are very close: The former housing secretary Julián Castro and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang have surpassed 130,000 donations and each have three of the four qualifying polls they need, while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has met the polling threshold and has about 120,000 donors.
Beyond them, only three candidates have even a single qualifying poll to their name: the impeachment activist Tom Steyer (2 polls), Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii (1) and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado (1).
We asked all three of their campaigns to provide donor numbers so we could assess where they stood. Ms. Gabbard had just under 114,000 donors as of Wednesday night. A spokesman for Mr. Steyer said he was "on track to collect the required number of donors to make the September debate stage" but did not give a number. Mr. Hickenlooper's campaign did not respond, but Politico reported a month ago that he had only 13,000 donors.
The other 11 candidates in the race have no qualifying polls to their name, and they all went into this week's debates seeking a viral moment that would attract new donors and lift them, even briefly, in the polls.
The qualification rules do not require enduring support. Even a small post-debate surge could push a 1 percent candidate up to 2 percent in the small handful of polls he or she needs.
But for those who have not qualified, the Aug. 28 deadline is an existential threat. Candidates like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York or Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington could be washed out of the race if they don't get momentum from this week's debates. And if you're wondering whether they're anxious, the answer is yes.
Ms. Gabbard's campaign calculated at one point that she needed a new donor every minute to reach 130,000 by the Aug. 28 deadline, so if you go to her website, a timer next to the donation button begins counting down 60 seconds. Then the text changes.
"ὤ1 Oh no!" it says. "The time expired and you didn't donate!"
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Motherhood compelled Felix to speak her mind

Texto completo: A fundamental tenet of being a sprinter is staying in your lane, and for years, Allyson Felix applied it to every portion of her career. Obsessive focus helped make her the most decorated American woman in Olympic history. By age 30, she had won nine Olympic medals - six gold, three silver - and nine of her 11 world championships. She ran for an apparel company, endorsed products and stayed silent on issues outside of her performance. The thought of using her platform for other purposes scared her. She viewed herself, first and only, as an athlete.
"I'm not one to shake things up," Felix said this week in a phone conversation. "I don't know, I'm just - I've always been very laid-back, sometimes quiet. It's just not natural to come out and have a hard stance on different things."
The past year, the most harrowing of her life, transformed Felix. In November, Felix delivered daughter Camryn early via emergency Caesarean section. The birth left Felix with physical complications. Camryn spent her first weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, fighting for life. Meanwhile, the sprinter's Nike sponsorship contract expired, and according to Felix, the company greeted her maternity with a drastically reduced renewal offer. As she fretted for both her and Camryn's health, she wondered whether she would ever compete again.
This past weekend, Felix returned at the U.S. track and field outdoor national championships in Des Moines, running unattached. She ran slower than usual but advanced to the 400-meter final before falling short of making the world championships as an individual. She qualified to be a potential member of the 4x400 relay in Qatar this fall.
She felt grateful and showcased a new, unrestrained sense of purpose. In May, Felix wrote an op-ed in the New York Times denouncing Nike's maternity practices and calling for greater support for athletes who become mothers. Now, she has further plans to wield her formidable voice. She defines herself as more than an athlete, and even something in addition to a mother. For the first time, Felix describes herself with a word she once would have run from: activist.
"When you are talking about life-changing situations, I think becoming a mother and having a daughter and understanding what she'll face in the world, it's just bigger than myself and any comforts that I've experienced," Felix said. "It's time for me."
When Felix denounced Nike, many within and around track and field wondered what club or company she would end up running under. She announced this week that Athleta, which had never backed an athlete, will be her primary sponsor. She chose Athleta, she said, because the company shared similar values and agreed to help her launch initiatives to empower and support women.
"I think it's really redefining what sponsorship looks like," Felix said. "They're excited to celebrate me as a whole athlete. That's not just my performance but being a mother and an activist as well. I've really never experienced that before."
Felix has not finalized how she'll "get my hands dirty and create change," she said, but she has ideas. She wants to address the maternal mortality rate of African American women, which is three times higher than that of white women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
She wants to effect change in track and field, to find better solutions for athletes who become mothers and "ways that you can support the whole athlete so that we can be our best." She noted, after a weekend of trying to find time to sleep and wash bottles in a hotel room, that the women's professional tennis tour offers child care. She called for women in positions of power in both apparel companies and governing bodies such as USA Track and Field and the IAAF, the sport's global organization.
"More women at the table, decision-makers - that is definitely what is needed," Felix said. "Women who have been through this, who have experiences, who can come up with a number of things off the top of their head of ways we can be supported."
There was a time when Felix, 33, would have felt uncomfortable speaking about any of these issues. But her experience over the past year changed her.
"It helped me find my voice," she said. "It helped me understand what was important to me and just really made me feel like I couldn't sit down silent any longer. I just had never expected to face challenges giving birth. That was the furthest thing from my mind. I can say that I definitely took my health for granted. Being a professional athlete, it's what I do. That really shook my world. . . . Previously, I was so focused on my performance on the track, and it was scary for me to talk about these other issues. But I finally feel like I'm in a place where I have something to add to the conversation. I'm excited to continue to do that."
In December, Felix remained in the hospital, and her daughter stayed a floor below hers, in the NICU fighting Bradycardia, a condition that causes infants to struggle breathing. One day when she visited, Camryn stopped breathing. Doctors had to stimulate her to start breathing again. Machines beeped. Alarms sounded. In a nearby room, Felix heard a woman's piercing scream, and she knew something awful had happened. Nurses scurried to close doors.
She remembers thinking: "Am I still going to be running track? Is that something that is still important to me? I'm not healthy. My daughter is not healthy. We're fighting for health right now."
Track was not on her mind.
"Those were definitely days where I wasn't sure if it was important enough to me to be able to continue on," Felix said.
Felix found strength in talking with other mothers in the NICU. During weeks in the hospital, she leaned on others and started to realize she could offer the same support.
"There was just something about the power of knowing that you're not alone," Felix said. "Hearing someone else's story, being able to talk to someone when you're going through these difficult times, and I think I understood more than ever when you share your story, what that does. I don't think I understood that before. I always felt like, 'What do I really have to add?' Or, 'I'm not going to be able to change anything.' Really coming to the point where I know there is power in what I went through."
When Camryn improved to the point she could go home, Felix drew motivation from a desire to share her story, and she knew returning to track would provide a larger platform. She took inspiration from other Olympians who became mothers: Alysia Montano, Nia Ali, Stephanie Bruce and others. After her op-ed, she heard stories from mothers outside of track who were afraid to tell their bosses they were pregnant.
"I just felt like there's no way I could just sit by and be silent," Felix said.
To be clear, Felix remains an athlete with plenty of ambition. She plans to compete next summer in her fifth Olympics. After limited training following recovery from physical trauma, her performance this past weekend, while modest by her standards, convinced her she can return to elite form.
"The fire is still there," she said.
She may appreciate competing more than ever. In Des Moines, she experienced a first. She used to dread the immediate aftermath of races - the sensation of lactic acid flooding her muscles, giving interviews feeling "delirious" and wondering if her words made sense. On Saturday, she walked from the finish line to the stands. Her husband, Kenneth Ferguson, passed Camryn to her, and Felix hugged her daughter.
"It was the most amazing thing," Felix said. "To be able to see her face, it just kind of sent all that away for the moment. It was just the best feeling, regardless of the result."

Texto completo: The Justice Department has declined to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey over for allegedly mishandling classified information.
The Justice Department inspector general's office referred Comey for potential prosecution after investigators found the former director had kept FBI memos he wrote containing classified information in his home. Some of the memos he kept he gave to Daniel Richman, an attorney and friend, to leak to the New York Times.
Justice Department prosecutors declined to go after Comey because of a lack of evidence Comey intentionally violated the law, or even knew what the law was on securely storing classified information, according to CNN.

KHN's ‘What The Health?': Deciphering The Democrats' Health Debate

Twenty Democratic candidates for president debated health care at length over two nights in Detroit this week. But countless 30-second charges and countercharges from “Medicare for All” backers and those who want a more gradual approach to universal coverage may have left the audience more confused than ever about the best way to make the health system better and more affordable.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration sought to counterprogram against the debates, unveiling plans to allow states to potentially purchase cheaper prescription drugs from Canada and requiring hospitals to make public the prices they negotiate with insurers.
This week’s panelists are Julie Rovner from Kaiser Health News, Alice Ollstein of Politico, Kimberly Leonard of the Washington Examiner and Caitlin Owens of Axios.
Among the takeaways from this week’s podcast:
The Democratic presidential debate format has been good at exposing the differences among candidates on their plans to get more Americans health care. But there was little mention of other important health issues, including how they would protect the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that insurers cover people with medical problems, lower drug prices or handle state requests to implement work requirements for Medicaid enrollees. Debaters were quick to talk about problems they see stemming from the way insurers and drugmakers operate, but they did not touch on another major player in setting health care costs: hospitals. Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, unveiled her plan for a Medicare for All health system this week and endorsed the use of private Medicare Advantage plans. But Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), another contender and the original author of a Medicare for All plan, complained that Medicare has been a lucrative part of the business for those private insurers and that they should not be included in Democratic efforts to set up a single-payer Medicare system. Harris’ plan was also criticized by more moderate Democrats because it would require everyone with employer-provided insurance to change to either Medicare or a Medicare Advantage plan. Recent announcements by the Trump administration on new health care policies, such as the option for states to explore importing drugs from Canada or forcing hospitals to post the prices they have negotiated with insurers, appear to be an effort to give the president a stronger health portfolio as he goes into the 2020 campaign.
Plus, for extra credit, the panelists recommend their favorite health policy stories of the week they think you should read too:
Julie Rovner: The Washington Post’s “ Driven to the end: Olympic cyclist Kelly Catlin could do it all. Until it all became too much,” by Kent Babb.
Alice Ollstein: The New York Times’ “ Need Extra Time on Tests? It Helps to Have Cash,” by Dana Goldstein and Jugal K. Patel.
Kimberly Leonard: The San Francisco Chronicle’s “ One Day, One City, No Relief: 24 hours inside San Francisco’s crisis,” by Kevin Fagan and Chronicle Staff.
Caitlin Owens: Bloomberg News’ “ Drugmakers’ Alleged Price-Fixing Pushed a Needed Pill Out of Reach,” by Ben Elgin.

Texto completo: Summer may be dwindling, but your favorite streaming services are offering you plenty of new series to keep you occupied while you stay inside, away from the August humidity and heat.
Each month streaming networks, including like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and CBS All Access, debut original series, add old favorites (or not so favorites) and subtract TV shows and movies fans love. There's a lot of junk, too, from movies you've never heard of to original series better suited for late-night cable.
So you don't waste time watching glorified digital space fillers, we've rounded up the best series worth adding to your queue this month.
"Dear White People" Season 3 (Netflix, Aug. 2): The quirky, irreverent comedy returns for a third season set on the fictional Winchester College campus. The acting and writing on this series gets better every year.
"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power" Season 3 (Netflix, Aug. 2): This sweet, positive and gorgeously animated kids' series is back, and it's just as fun for adults as it is for the children itaims to entertain.
"Free Meek" (Amazon, Aug. 9): This five-part documentary chronicles rapper Meek Mill's struggle in the criminal-justice system, examining the infraction that he was originally arrested for ("popping a wheelie"), his incarceration for probation violations and the movement around his experience.
"GLOW" Season 3 (Netflix, Aug. 9): The Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling move their choke holds and pile drivers to Las Vegas, which is darker but no less raucous.
Tiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready (Netflix, Aug. 13): The comedian gave it her all in a solo Showtime stand-up special "She Ready!" in 2017, but in her new Netflix event she showcases six other comedians.
"Why Women Kill (CBS All Access, Aug. 15): The creator of "Desperate Housewives" and "Devious Maids" is back with a series that might be even more salacious than those two soapy dramas. "Women" stars Lucy Liu, Ginnifer Goodwin and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as three women living in three different eras (1960s, 1980s and 2019) all dealing with infidelity in their marriages.
"Mindhunter" Season 2 (Netflix, Aug. 16): David Fincher's dark crime drama returns for a second season, ready to continue exploring the psychology of serial killers, with great performances from Jonathan Groff, Anna Torv and Holt McCallany.
"Diagnosis" (Netflix, Aug. 16): The documentary series, based on Dr. Lisa Sanders' New York Times Magazine column, crowd-sources the public's diagnostic knowledge to help people struggling with unknown illnesses find answers. It's the kind of series that helps you believe in the kindness of strangers.
"Designing Women" (Hulu, Aug. 26): The classic sitcom will be available to stream (or rather, devour) for the first time, on Women's Equality Day. We can only hope Hulu will help bring interior designer Julia Sugarbaker (Dixie Carter) and the rest of the firm to a new generation that could use some style tips.
"The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance" (Netflix, Aug. 30): Jim Henson's cult 1982 fantasy film gets a limited-series prequel with an A-list voice cast (Mark Hamill and Sigourney Weaver, to name just two), and recreates the puppet world of Thra in stunning detail.
"Carnival Row" (Amazon, Aug. 30): For those who love the psychedelic, Orlando Bloom, Cara Delevingne or all three, the Victorian fantasy is set in a world filled with mythological creatures feared by humans.

By Tik Root
Last year the United States Postal Service delivered more than 77 billion pieces of marketing mail, and I think a lot of it went to me.
When I sort my mail, the vast majority is unwanted -- usually enough fliers, credit card offers and unsolicited promotions to fill my recycling bin. All that mail has a significant effect on our climate, including the loss of trees and the energy used for producing and transporting huge quantities of paper.
That's why some environmental groups have pushed for a national Do Not Mail List, similar to the Federal Trade Commission's Do Not Call Registry, and the Sierra Club recently called for a ban on unsolicited mail. But environmentalists say industry pushback against legislation has been fierce. "There's huge economic interest involved," said Joshua Martin, the director of the Environmental Paper Network. "Politically it's a really tough one to go at."
The Postal Service, for example, makes billions of dollars each year from marketing mail. According to the Association of National Advertisers, Americans received nearly 10 billion catalogs in 2017.
John Wolfe, a spokesman for the association, wrote in an email that direct mail supported thousands of jobs and had proved effective as a marketing channel. Plus, he added, "we have many members that use properly sourced paper and pay attention to environmental stewardship."
Mr. Martin disputed the claim that marketing mail is effective. He called it "a low-value and high-volume use of paper."
With a national registry appearing unlikely anytime soon, can you put a stop to unwanted mail? Probably not. But there are steps you can take to reduce the volume.
CatalogChoice.org is free and lets you set preferences one catalog at a time. The Association of National Advertisers runs DMAChoice.org, which lets you remove your name from a broader categories and lists, though there's a $ 2 fee.
There's also OptOutPrescreen.com, which is recommended by the Federal Trade Commission and run by the major credit bureaus. It lets you stop preapproved credit or insurance offers for up to five years.
And don't forget to sign up for electronic delivery for of bank, credit card and other account statements. Just be sure you don't need a physical copy of those documents.
Another big source of unwanted paper can be phone books. Millions of Americans still receive the Yellow Pages. Yellowpagesoptout.com should get you off the phone book list for at least a few years.
With broader initiatives on marketing mail stalled, Mr. Martin said that taking personal action was all the more important. "It's a small act that makes a difference," he said. If a grass-roots movement to limit mailings gains steam, he said "it'd really be significant for reducing the demand for wood, water and energy."

2019 Has Seen Fewer Natural Disasters. It's Probably a Blip.
By Christopher Flavelle
The pace of natural disasters slowed in the first half of this year, but the ones that hit highlighted persistent weaknesses in the world's defenses against catastrophes -- weaknesses that will only become more dangerous as climate change gets worse.
According to new data issued Tuesday by Munich Re, the reinsurance giant, there were 370 natural catastrophes worldwide in the first six months of 2019. That tally, which includes cyclones, flash floods, heat waves and other disasters, was down from 460 during the same period last year, and slightly less than the average of 400 over the past decade.
Total losses came to $ 42 billion. That's no small amount, but it is less than the $ 62 billion recorded in the first half of 2018, and about half the average for the same period during the past 10 years.
But there's no reason to expect the decline in losses to last, according to the company, which says that the trend for disasters has been moving clearly in one direction: Up.
"A year is always a data point, which can be slightly lower or higher," said Raghuveer Vinukollu, who heads the natural catastrophe solutions team at Munich Reinsurance America. "But the overall trend is definitely saying higher."
The world's costliest disasters were once again in the United States. That's a reminder, according to Mr. Vinukollu, of the vulnerabilities of the country's building codes and infrastructure.
He said the United States needed to be more aggressive in both areas. "There is definitely a shortage of investment," Mr. Vinukollu said.
The world's most expensive catastrophe so far this year was the series of tornadoes and severe storms across the central United States in the second half of May, producing $ 3.3 billion in damages. That was followed by $ 3 billion for the storms and floods that hit the Midwest in March.
The United States had the world's most expensive disasters in 2018, with the Camp Fire, Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Florence.
But if the United States is ill-prepared for the effects of disasters, the latest data shows that the situation in poorer countries is many times worse.
The deadliest event so far this year was Cyclone Idai, which hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in March, killing more than 1,000 people. The next deadliest were a heat wave in India in May and June, which killed an estimated 210 people, and flash flooding in Indonesia that killed 200. (By contrast, the two worst disasters in the United States so far this year killed 15 people.)
The toll from those disasters has been economic as well as human. The damage from Cyclone Idai equaled about one-tenth of Mozambique's annual economic output, according to Munich Re, which said that almost none of those losses were insured.
"Disasters in poorer countries are worrying because the victims so often have virtually no insurance," Torsten Jeworrek, a member of Munich Re's board of management, said in a statement. "Such countries often take years to recover."

From the mailbag
Hello and welcome back!
One sharp-eyed reader pointed out that we got something wrong last week in our item on carbon offsets: The Gold Standard is not an auditor. The organization sets out requirements for environmental projects, but it does not verify them. The verification is done by third-party auditors. The Gold Standard does have a database of verified projects.
It wasn't the only thing we got wrong in the carbon offsets item. There was a typo in the writer's name. She is Jillian Mock. Not Jiliian.
Your editors are sorry, Jillian.
Have a great week.

F.A.A. Oversight of Boeing Scrutinized

Texto completo: Senior leaders from the Federal Aviation Administration defended the certification of the 737 Max at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, but raised the possibility of changing the process for approving new aircraft.
"We continue to hear of more problems with F.A.A.'s certification of the 737 Max aircraft," Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said in her opening statement at a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on oversight of the agency.
"These stories are particularly damaging for the leadership of F.A.A.'s safety oversight," she added.
Since two crashes, in March and October, of Boeing's 737 Max planes killed 346 people, lawmakers and federal investigators have been reviewing potential flaws in the agency's approval of the plane. The F.A.A., which took longer than international regulators to ground the plane after the first accident, has come under fire for failing to catch the risks in new software on the Max that contributed to both crashes. The hearing covered a variety of aviation matters, but committee members took a specific interest in new reports of missteps in the Max's certification.
Over the weekend, The New York Times published an investigation into the F.A.A.'s certification of the Max, which revealed that agency managers made decisions in part based on Boeing's timing and budget needs.
Citing the Times story, Ms. Collins raised concerns over "instances in which F.A.A. managers appeared to be more concerned with Boeing's production timeline, rather than the safety recommendations of its own engineers."
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that the "grave" allegations in The Times "speak to the need for a culture change that rebalances the relationship between regulator and industry."
F.A.A. officials said they were open to re-evaluating the process. "If there are improvements we need to make, changes we need to make, if there needs to be a different balance in delegation," said Carl Burleson, the F.A.A.'s deputy acting administrator, "we are certainly willing and ready to take those recommendations."
Committee members questioned the decision to leave pilots largely in the dark about the existence of MCAS, an automated system designed to help avoid stalls that played a role in the two crashes.
Ali Bahrami, the F.A.A.'s head of safety, acknowledged that the agency could have done more to inform pilots about MCAS. "We should have included more description in the computer-based training in order to explain what MCAS is," Mr. Bahrami said.
But agency officials defended the certification of the Max, and the increasing reliance on aircraft manufacturers to help approve their own planes. In 2018, the F.A.A. allowed Boeing to certify 96 percent of its work.
"We have been fully knowledgeable in dealing with the development of that plane," Mr. Burleson said. "It doesn't mean that each decision we've made has always been perfect. But I do believe the fundamental process of how we went about certifying the Max was sound."
The F.A.A. has been without a permanent administrator for most of the past 18 months. Stephen Dickson, a former Delta Air Lines executive, was confirmed as the next permanent administrator last month despite concerns from Senate Democrats.
Senators also asked the F.A.A. officials about whether the agency took appropriate action after the crash of a Lion Air jet, in October. The F.A.A. decided to publish emergency instructions for handling a malfunction instead of grounding the plane. Mr. Bahrami defended the agency's decision at the time, though said the F.A.A. was committed to improving.
"Despite the strong spotlight we are under, we welcome this scrutiny, as it will make us stronger," Mr. Bahrami said.

MAYOR PETE THINKS DEMOCRATS LOOK ALIKE ON CLIMATE. IS HE RIGHT? Pete Buttigieg raised an interesting point during the first night of Democratic debates Tuesday, in which climate change got more air time, but not enough for activists.
“We have all put out highly similar visions on climate,” said Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. “It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate, if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump.”
There is certainly a real gulf between centrist Democrats and progressives over whether to frame climate change as an all-encompassing issue that should also entail enacting “Medicare for all” and instituting a federal jobs guarantee, as opposed to looking at global warming more narrowly.
Asked if the Green New Deal is unrealistic, centrist John Delaney said:
“It ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate, like universal health care, guaranteed government jobs, and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do.”
I’ve seen this before: Delaney proceeded to explain his agenda, which he called “realistic,” that actually shares a lot in common with other candidates.
He would tax carbon and return the revenue to Americans. While candidates disagree with how to do it, and how big a component of their agenda it should be, most have proposed pricing carbon in some form. Delaney also supports uncontroversial ideas among Democrats like increasing the Energy Department research budget by “fivefold,” boosting investments in renewables, and supporting progress in direct air capture technology to swipe carbon directly from the atmosphere.
All of that, he claimed, would “get us to net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the timeline that most candidates and the United Nations climate panel say is necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
“All of us agree that we have to address climate change,” said another centrist candidate, Steve Bullock, the governor of red-state Montana. “The Republicans won’t even acknowledge that climate change is real.”
Liberals say that’s a false choice: Green New Deal supporters Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren disagreed with the moderates’ framing.
“What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point and say, ‘Oh, we don’t really have to do anything,’” Warren said. “That’s the problem we’ve got in Washington right now. It continues to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change.”
Warren, who has released detailed climate change plans, and Sanders, who has not released a plan, say their approaches are different because of their confrontational approach to fossil fuel companies, and focus on restructuring the economy with high-paying clean energy, union-backed jobs.
“Look, I put a real policy on the table to create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing,” Warren said. “This could revitalize huge cities across this country. And no one wants to talk about it.”
What do voters want?: Buttigieg and Bullock seem to be arguing that while Democratic voters say climate change is among, if not the most, concerning issue to them — especially as Trump treads water on the subject — people don’t appreciate the distinction between specific plans that look broadly similar when deciding who to vote for.
A recent poll by the Sierra Club and Morning Consult published last week supports this contention.
Voters who say that Democratic candidates’ climate plans are “very important” picked Joe Biden as their top choice. Biden, not known as the most aggressive climate hawk, continues to lead in national polls. Warren and Sanders are second and third in the Sierra Club poll respectively. But Jay Inslee, who has the most detailed and ambitious climate change plans, does not rank in the poll.
Some of this could reflect name recognition, just like the national polls at this early stage.
Paul Bledsoe, a former climate change adviser to President Bill Clinton, sees the poll as more telling.
"Whoever gets the nomination will have the most aggressive climate proposals in history -- voters know this, so distinctions between plans are being lost,” Bledsoe told me.
Others analysts disagree, and said the nuances between candidates’ climate change agendas are meaningful, similar to other issues like health care.
“Would we accept this argument on any other issue?” Leah Stokes, an assistant professor of environmental politics at the University of California at Santa Barbara, told me. “Would we say ‘we all agree on healthcare’ even if it's not true? No. That wouldn't be acceptable. To me this shows an ignorance of the scale of the crisis and the need for meaningful plans to meet this problem.”

SANDERS AND BULLOCK FIGHT OVER HOW CLIMATE PLANS TREAT WORKERS: Sanders bristled at a suggestion at Tuesday night's debate that supporters of the Green New Deal don’t care about workers in the fossil fuel industry, insisting that he supports a transition to clean energy that would protect workers.
Sanders took exception after Bullock said, “As we transition to this clean energy economy, you have to recognize there are folks that have spent their whole lives powering our country, and far too often Democrats sound like they’re part of the problem."
"Ain't nobody in Congress more strongly pro-worker than I am," Sanders said. "We can create what the Green New Deal is about. It's a bold idea. We can create millions of good-paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker.”
Sanders generally attacks the "fossil fuel industry" rather than its workers.
Some Democratic presidential candidates, including Inslee, Biden, Warren, and Beto O’Rourke, have emphasized helping fossil fuel-dependent communities as part of their plans to eliminate the use of coal, oil, and gas, proposing guarantees for health insurance and pension benefits, as well as funds for career training.
INSLEE SUPER PAC AIRS AD ATTACKING OTHER DEMOCRATS DURING DEBATES: A super PAC that supports Inslee is airing an ad criticizing his Democratic primary opponents during the presidential debates Tuesday and Wednesday, the Washington Examiner’s Emily Larsen reported.
The ad from Act Now on Climate pictures five top-tier candidates — California Sen. Kamala Harris, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, and Sanders — as its narrator says, "Democrats aren't making climate change the number one issue."
Act Now on Climate will spend six figures to show the ad in Iowa during the debates and continue in Iowa media markets for another week, Politico reported.
REPUBLICANS, BUSINESS COMMUNITY TOUT ‘INNOVATION’-FIRST APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE: Trump administration officials and Republicans in Congress touted the approach of spurring private sector innovation to combat climate change during appearances at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Energy Innovates summit Wednesday morning.
“We are determined to lead the drive for a cleaner energy world,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry said, ticking off “strides” in renewables, energy storage, and advanced nuclear technologies. “We will continue to do so without surrendering one iota of growth. I totally respect people's sometimes single minded focus on climate change, but the United States is leading the role in the reduction of emissions.”
The Chamber of Commerce has recently shifted its rhetoric on climate change to acknowledge climate change as a problem best addressed through technologies such as carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and energy storage, while dismissing mandates, carbon pricing, or regulation.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, struck a similar note at the Chamber event, expressing alarm about the hot weather and rise in water temperature off her state’s coast this summer, and celebrating legislation in her Energy and Natural Resources Committee on “energy innovation” bills.
“It's more than just a blip,” Murkowski said off the climate-change related impacts on her state. “It's what we have been seeing.”
“We don't seem to get those top of the fold headlines about good news,” she said earlier. “How we are leading in this country when it comes to energy innovation that will move us to this cleaner energy future, reduce emissions, and a stronger economy.”
EPA VACATES OBAMA-ERA DECISION BLOCKING ALASKA MINING PROJECT: The EPA said Tuesday it is revoking the Obama administration’s proposed veto of a gold mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay that prevented it from being built since 2014.
The EPA said the Obama administration was incorrect to propose water pollution restrictions against the proposed gold mine before a review process was completed. But the agency has not decided whether to approve the gold mine. It is allowing for the completion of an ongoing permitting process being conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
A flip of a flip-flop: Former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt had left in place the Obama administration's block of the project, agreeing the proposed mine would poison rivers leading to Bristol Bay, which supports the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery.
Pruitt's decision reversed a prior determination he made, where he had begun a process of undoing the Obama administration's attempt to block the mine.
But now, the EPA under Administrator Andrew Wheeler — who has recused himself from the review of project — wants to complete the permitting process for the mine, arguing the prior administration stopped the project preemptively.
“[The] decision restores the proper process for 404(c) determinations, eliminating a preemptive veto of a hypothetical mine and focusing EPA’s environmental review on an actual project before the Agency,” said EPA General Counsel Matthew Z. Leopold.
MANCHIN URGES TRUMP TO NOMINATE FERC COMMISSIONERS FROM EACH PARTY: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia urged Trump Tuesday to rise above the “political fray” and simultaneously nominate one Republican and one Democrat to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
FERC will have two vacancies at the end of August after its longest-serving Democrat Cheryl LaFleur retires. LaFleur’s departure will leave FERC with only three commissioners — Democrat Rich Glick and two Republicans, Chairman Neil Chatterjee and Bernard McNamee.
Former Republican Chairman Kevin McIntyre died of cancer in January. While no political party can hold more than three seats on the five-member commission, Trump could technically nominate a Republican to replace McIntyre and stall on nominating a Democrat, leaving LaFleur’s seat open.
“I urge President Trump to nominate two individuals, one Republican and one Democrat, so the Senate can consider and confirm them together in the bipartisan manner that has become the norm and restore a fully functioning commission,” said Manchin, the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees FERC.
DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEYS GENERAL SEEK ACTION FROM CONGRESS ON PFAS CHEMICALS: A coalition of 22 Democratic state attorneys general urged Congress Tuesday to pass legislation combating toxic chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, that have contaminated U.S. water supplies.
The attorneys general wants Congress to provide financial assistance to help state and local governments offset the cost of cleaning up drinking water supplies. They also say lawmakers should pass legislation designating PFAS as a hazardous substance under the Superfund law, and to phase out the use of PFAS in firefighting foam
“When it comes to the health and safety of New Yorkers, inaction isn’t an option,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who spearheaded the coalition’s letter to congressional leadership. “These toxic ‘forever’ chemicals endanger the wellbeing of people across our state, and we need federal legislation to address the threat.”
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS INVESTIGATING RYAN ZINKE OVER EMAIL USE: The Justice Department is investigating former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke over his use of private email to conduct official business.
The Interior Department inspector general confirmed in a letter to Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee that it is jointly investigating Zinke's use of private email as part of a "related criminal investigation."
That larger investigation is believed to be focused on a real estate deal involving a foundation Zinke once ran, and David Lesar, the chairman of the large oil services firm Halliburton, as reported by the New York Times.
“Leaving office half a step ahead of the law doesn’t wipe the slate clean,” said Natural Resources Committee chairman Raul Grijalva of Arizona, in a statement Tuesday upon publishing the Interior IG letter. “It’s imperative that political appointees at the Department of Justice allow this investigation to continue unimpeded regardless of the risk to Mr. Zinke or other Trump officials.”

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went after New York Times editor Jonathan Weisman for casting doubt on whether Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar were from the Midwest.
"They literally are, &this comment is what erasure looks like. HIGH TURNOUT from DEEP BLUE SEATS &being competitive everywhere is the core of a winning strategy," the New York Democrat said Wednesday on Twitter. "It’s disturbing to see this Trump talking pt that dense, diverse communities 'aren’t the REAL [America/Midwest/etc].'"
Tweet
"Saying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying @RepLloydDoggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South. C’mon," Weisman said in the early hours of Wednesday on Twitter.
"Also, I grew up in Atlanta. John Lewis was my congressman. But my first jobs were with the Marietta Daily Journal. So please don’t tell me that Atlanta is synonymous with Georgia. It isn’t. Also it take nothing away from @IlhanMN to say the message that my fan-girl in-law loves on Lake Harrriett doesn’t work with my in-laws in Plymouth and Shoreview."
NYT Editor Tweet
Weisman, the newspaper's deputy Washington editor, later deleted the tweets.
Ocasio-Cortez's accusation that Weisman used Trump talking points on race came as she repeatedly accused Trump of being a racist.
"You’re right, Mr. President - you don’t have a racist bone in your body. You have a racist mind in your head, and a racist heart in your chest," Ocasio-Cortez told Trump earlier this month after he told her to "go back" to her home country.
Tweet
Days later she said the president was "an impulsive racist."
Weisman's critique of Tlaib and Omar was in response to Waleed Shahid, a former campaign strategist for Ocasio-Cortez, slamming former Sen. Claire McCaskill for saying: "Free stuff from the government does not play well in the Midwest."
"@RashidaTlaib + @IlhanMN are also from the Midwest," Shahid said on Twitter. "Medicare and Social Security are both technically 'free stuff' and they play very well."Tweet
Omar, 37, also responded to Weisman's belief that she did not represent the Midwest, saying: "this will certainly be news to people of Minnesota’s 5th District!"Tweet

The stories that divide us

Texto completo: The latest issue of New York magazine features a long, bizarre, amazing story by Kera Bolonik about a hapless Harvard Law professor, Bruce Hay, who managed to get duped by two apparent grifters, Maria-Pia Shuman and Mischa Haider, one a lesbian and one a transgender woman, into believing that he had fathered a child with Shuman - a con that they allegedly ran on multiple men at once.
From this paternity-trap beginning, Hay found himself emotionally entangled, ideologically bullied and effectively extorted. At one point, Shuman and Haider somehow tricked him into letting them "house-nap" his Cambridge home, until a court order evicted them. Finally, as the grift ran dry, Haider filed a sexual harassment complaint against Hay that's still being adjudicated by Harvard.
When this story - far more byzantine even than my summary - dropped into the internet, the second-most-interesting thing, after the wild tale itself, was to watch how it was read by people who lean right versus people who lean left. The leftward-leaners were more likely to focus on Hay as a uniquely gullible or lust-addled individual and to draw strictly personal lessons from his disastrous arc. (For instance, to quote the Atlantic's Adam Serwer, that "men need meaningful and supportive friendships with people they are not married to, especially into middle age.")
The rightward-leaners, on the other hand, read the story politically, as a vivid allegory for the relationship between the old liberalism and the new - between a well-meaning liberal establishment that's desperate to act enlightened and a woke progressivism that ruthlessly exploits the establishment's ideological subservience. ("Not only did [Hay] trust Shuman," Bolonik writes, but "he felt it would have been insulting for a heterosexual cisgender man to question a professed lesbian as to whether she'd had sex with other men.") In this reading the Hay-Shuman-Haider story is a real-life version of a Michel Houellebecq novel, a tale of liberal culture that wears reactionary implications on its sleeve.
Since I am a right-leaner you can easily imagine to which reading I was instinctively inclined. But step back a bit, and the contrasting responses to this one bonkers story offer a way to think about our political polarization, which is shaped by a recurring version of the Hay story's reception.
By this I mean the heart of polarization is often not a disagreement about the facts of a particular narrative but about whether that story is somehow representative - or whether it's just one tale among many in our teeming society and doesn't stand for anything larger than itself.
When conservatives talk about liberal media bias, for instance, their complaint isn't necessarily that mainstream outlets fail to report stories that might confirm a conservative worldview. Rather, it's that they report on them in ways that make them sound dry and dull or just random and unrepresentative, without ever acknowledging their wider interest or significance.
Likewise, when liberals damn conservative megaphones for reporting "alternative facts" instead of real ones, what they often really mean is that the right-wing media reports on real facts and real stories - crimes committed by illegal immigrants, say, or the violent edge to the Antifa protests - but then overstates or misreads their significance.
All this suggests that breaking out of polarization, thinking for yourself instead of as a partisan, is ultimately more about imagination than information, and not something achieved by becoming better educated in the facts of issue X or Y or Z. (Indeed, studies suggest that the most factually informed voters are also reliably the most partisan.)
If I were trying to de-polarize someone, in the way that you de-program members of cults or revolutionary cells, I might hand them a copy of their favorite magazine or newspaper and ask them to construct a version in which the exact same set of stories were edited and headlined and prioritized by an editor from the opposite political persuasion. (I promise you my own guest-editing stint at New York would be fantastic.) Or to program an opinion show for Rachel Maddow using only stories that Chris Wallace and Bret Baier report, or a show for Laura Ingraham using only the stories that lead MSNBC.
It's not that full de-polarization is ever possible; basic moral and philosophical commitments inevitably divide us. But seeing our disagreements through the lens of narrative might get us closer to a crucial insight - which is that in a big, diverse and complicated society, multiple narratives can all be true at once.
Maybe Bruce Hay's strange odyssey isn't actually a heightened example of what's gone wrong with academic liberalism or the sexual revolution as a whole. But it could be such an example, and the mistreatment of a particular migrant family at the border could also be a heightened example of what's gone wrong with Trumpian conservatism ... because choosing a side, as we all tend to do, doesn't have to mean taking only that side's narratives as truth.
And nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.

Texto completo: New York's most powerful restaurant marriage has come to an end.
The chef Daniel Humm and his business partner, Will Guidara, who in 2011 bought the elegant restaurant Eleven Madison Park from their mentor, the restaurateur Danny Meyer, and transformed it into one of the world's most lauded dining destinations and the crown jewel of a restaurant group that stretches from London to Los Angeles, are splitting up their multimillion-dollar partnership.
With help from an investor, Mr. Humm is buying out Mr. Guidara's share of the business. Mr. Guidara plans to use the money to open his own restaurant group. Neither would disclose the financial terms of the deal.
Although some top staff members of the group had known about the pending breakup for weeks, most of the staff of about 1,000 people found out today in an email.
"It's been an incredible run and I think we both learned a lot from each other, but we also have evolved in different ways," Mr. Humm said in a joint interview with Mr. Guidara. "We're extremely proud. We just came to the conclusion in the end that what would be best for the company is if I continue to run it."
Mr. Guidara said that he would make public details of his plans soon. Mr. Humm said operations would largely remain the same but he plans to make some staffing changes, including the promotion of Jeffrey Tascarella to chief operating officer.
The two have joked that they resembled a married couple who rode ups and downs and sometimes fought in front of the children. As the chef Wylie Dufresne told Esquire magazine in a 2017 profile of Mr. Humm, "It's not like they're stuck with each other but the rise of each of them has been linked to the other. That relationship has helped to define a lot of decisions he's made. It's not totally clear where one starts and the other ends."
But by the beginning of this year, it was clear they were both ready for the relationship to change. They spent months examining a number of scenarios, including trying to find a way to stay together. But in the end, the path seemed clear.
"We spent a long time trying to divide the company and it just wasn't working," Mr. Guidara said. "It's a big company with lots of moving parts."
The men's relationship started in 2006, when Mr. Meyer lured Mr. Humm from San Francisco to conjure up dishes that could match the majestic dining room at Eleven Madison Park, and promoted Mr. Guidara to manage the restaurant. The men were young and ambitious, determined to make their mark inside the marble walls of a revered piece of New York culinary real estate in the Flatiron district.
They became as tight as brothers -- best friends, as they often referred to themselves in interviews. Their emphasis on hyper-personalized service and precise cooking propelled the restaurant to the top of nearly every critic's list and brought a cascade of awards. In 2011, Mr. Meyer sold Eleven Madison Park to Mr. Guidara, Mr. Humm and their financial backers.
Mr. Guidara and Mr. Humm created a company called Make It Nice that spawned a family of six other bars and restaurants, including the NoMad in the NoMad hotel in Manhattan, as well as NoMad restaurants in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. They also own Made Nice, a casual restaurant near the hotel that serves charred avocado and kale salads and roasted chicken with fries intended to become a mini chain. (Mr. Humm said he will continue with his plan to open the restaurant Davies and Brook in the Claridge's hotel in London this fall.) They have written four books together, too.
But after 13 years, the partnership grew rocky. They and others close to them say they have clashed as both they and the company have grown.
"We're not going to lie to you and say things are hunky dory," Mr. Guidara said in an interview in April. "We've been in a season of tension."
Still, both men described the split as an amicable one, with Mr. Humm taking control of their empire and Mr. Guidara developing plans for a new one.
The clear prize in the deal is Eleven Madison Park. With its soaring ceilings, marble walls and dramatic windows, it is one of the country's most expensive restaurants. A tasting menu costs $ 335 per person before drinks or tax, and dinner can stretch into a four- or five-hour affair.
Mr. Meyer opened the restaurant as a French-influenced bistro in 1998 in the lobby of the old Metropolitan Life Building. Eight years later, he brought in Mr. Guidara and Mr. Humm.
The men took on the challenge of turning Eleven Madison Park into something spectacular with a drive and enthusiasm that made even jaded New York chefs take notice. The menu was controlled and ambitious, and it reflected the precision and personality of Mr. Humm, who learned to cook in his native Switzerland and left a prime post as a four-star chef at Campton Place in San Francisco to work for Mr. Meyer. Mr. Guidara, who learned the trade at the hands of Mr. Meyer, was as focused in the dining room. His training manual for staff was 97 pages long.
The wunderkinds weren't always on the mark. In the early years, they had a difficult time gaining traction, and sometimes only served 10 tables a night. But in 2009, Frank Bruni, the New York Times restaurant critic at the time, awarded the restaurant four stars and its trajectory was set.
Then, in 2012, a year after they bought the place, they blew up the elegant, restrained menu and turned dining there into a tribute to old New York, with card tricks, a tabletop clambake and a cheese course in a handmade picnic basket. Pete Wells, The Times's current restaurant critic, called it "the most ridiculous meal I've ever had."
The pair eventually pulled back on the shtick, created a new menu and doubled down on a brand of service so personal that waiters were encouraged to glean information from customers so last-minute surprises tailored to each diner's interest would appear at the table before the meal was done. And, as had long been the custom, each would leave with a jar of Mr. Humm's granola for breakfast the next day.
The new menu brought another four-star review from Mr. Wells in The Times and, in 2017, Eleven Madison Park climbed to the top of the annual World's 50 Best Restaurants list.
That year, the restaurant closed for four months so the architect Brad Cloepfil could redesign it. It reopened in October with a modern, crisper look. The seating was more intimate, the entrance more dramatic and a large painting by Rita Ackermann, a friend of Mr. Humm's, dominated the dining room.
Meanwhile, life has changed for the men, too. Their personal lives have matured. What had been a near-singular focus on their work gave way to new and changing relationships. Mr. Guidara married Christina Tosi, a founder of the Milk Bar chain, in 2016. Mr. Humm has three daughters with two different women. After some time as a single man, he is pursuing a new relationship, too.
"As the founder of that restaurant and the person who introduced the two of them, I'm both proud of what they achieved together and sad their partnership is concluding," Mr. Meyer said. "On the other hand, I hope we will now get to see an amazing next solo chapter for each of them. It certainly happened for Lennon and McCartney."

Texto completo: In the past decade, data breaches and password leaks have struck companies such as Equifax, Facebook, Home Depot, Marriott, Target, Yahoo, Capital One and countless others.
If you have online accounts, hackers have likely leaked data from at least one of them. Want to know which of your accounts have been compromised? Search for your email address on the website Have I Been Pwned? (haveibeenpwned.com) to cross-reference your email address with hundreds of data breaches.
Everyone should use a password manager to generate and remember different, complex passwords for every account. This is the most important thing people can do to protect their privacy and security today.
Wirecutter, a review site owned by The New York Times, recommends the password managers LastPass and 1Password. Both can generate passwords, monitor accounts for security breaches, suggest changing weak passwords, and sync your passwords between your computer and phone. Password managers seem intimidating to set up, but once you've installed one, you just need to browse the internet as usual.
Take this time to also change the default passwords for any devices in your house. If your home router, smart light bulbs or security cameras are still using "password" or "1234" as the password, change them.
Everyone should also use two-step authentication whenever possible for their online accounts. Most banks and major social networks provide this option. As the name suggests, two-step authentication requires two steps: entering your password and entering a number only you can access. For example, step one is logging in to Facebook with your username and password. In step two, Facebook sends a temporary code to you in a text message or, even better, through an app like Google Authenticator, and you enter that code to log in. THORIN KLOSOWSKI

Texto completo: In May, executives from the giant public relations firm Edelman went to Florida to pitch a potential client: a private prisons company with contracts from the Trump administration to run immigrant detention centers.
The GEO Group, a multibillion-dollar business based in Boca Raton, was being battered by negative media attention in the uproar over reports that the United States was separating migrant children from their parents at the Mexican border. Lawmakers were demanding access to detention facilities.
The Edelman team, which included a former Trump administration spokeswoman, proposed to reshape the GEO Group's public image by "proactively correcting the record" with a new narrative "that tells the relevant stories directly to stakeholders," according to a presentation document reviewed by The New York Times.
After landing the job, Edelman was slated to start work in July. But employees at the firm objected to the contract, and Edelman dropped the GEO Group account.
According to several employees, Edelman reconsidered because of concerns that news of its relationship with the prison company would be leaked, leaving one of the world's leading public relations firms with a potential public relations crisis.
Other image management and consulting firms working for government agencies involved in the detention centers have recently faced criticism from consumers and their own employees. Ogilvy, the marketing and public relations firm, tried to confront internal consternation this month over its work for Customs and Border Protection, AdWeek reported. Last year, employees at Deloitte and McKinsey pushed for the companies to end their contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Several financial institutions have also backed away from the private prison industry, with SunTrust, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Wells Fargo having cut ties with companies associated with immigration detention centers like the GEO Group and CoreCivic.
Employees and executives from tech giants including Microsoft and Amazon have also protested their companies' ties to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other entities involved in the separation of migrant children from their parents.
In a statement to The Times, Edelman confirmed that it had dropped the GEO Group account. "Edelman takes on complex and diverse clients," the statement said. "We ultimately decided not to proceed with this work."
Edelman has touted its strong values and refuses to work with clients in the tobacco, coal or firearms businesses.
Lisa Ross, the president of Edelman's office in Washington, helped set up the presentation in Florida, according to a person who participated in meetings where the pitch was discussed. The person added that one of the Edelman employees who had delivered the pitch was Lindsay Walters, who joined the company in April after serving as a deputy press secretary in the White House. Ms. Ross and Ms. Walters did not respond to a request for comment.
Early in a slide show presentation to the GEO Group, Edelman said that "activists are using controversies around immigration to drive a wedge between you and your stakeholders," adding that "your current culture and structure are not prepared for this fight," according to documents shared with The Times.
In June, after word reached Edelman employees that the company would be doing work for the GEO Group, a debate sprang up on Fishbowl, a networking app used for industry communications. Screen shots of the Fishbowl messages from Edelman employees were shared with The Times.
"I am beyond disturbed," one employee wrote.
Another wrote, "This is an inherently political, moral & values based issue."
Several employees wrote that Edelman executives seemed to want to keep the GEO Group contract quiet, a move that they said was hypocritical and "a red flag."
Other employees disagreed with the objectors, chastising them for "pearl-clutching about private prisons" and suggesting that they leave "personal politics out of important client work."
Some employees asked to not be assigned to the GEO Group project, according to two people familiar with the requests. Others voiced their misgivings to supervisors.
In a recent all-hands meeting in Edelman's Washington office, executives informed employees that the company was resigning the GEO Group project.
The executives "took the opportunity to basically shame us for ruining the work for the company because they couldn't trust us not to leak it to the press," one person wrote on Fishbowl. Other Edelman employees made the same point in the Fishbowl thread.
In a statement, Edelman said, "This is an inaccurate reflection of what happened at the meeting."
The adjusted stock price for the GEO Group, a generous donor to President Trump, has gone down 28 percent in the past year.
The company, which for several years operated a migrant housing facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, has been criticized by government officials. A surprise inspection of a GEO Group processing center in California last year by the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found bedsheets braided into nooses, inadequate medical care and detainees who were improperly segregated and shackled.
The GEO Group is also battling a lawsuit, filed in 2017 by Washington State's attorney general, that accuses the company of paying thousands of immigrant detainee workers $ 1 a day since 2015 to prepare food, wash clothes and clean facilities. The state's minimum wage is now $ 12 an hour.
In a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, the GEO Group's chief executive, George C. Zoley, said the negative associations that had attached themselves to the GEO Group had resulted from a "deliberate mischaracterization of our longstanding role as a quality service provider to ICE." He added that the GEO Group was "taking steps to more aggressively tell our story to members of Congress, state legislators and the general media."
Mr. Zoley did not respond to a request for an interview.
On Tuesday, the GEO Group reported more than $ 82 million in net income for the year so far, a 14 percent jump from the same period in 2018. But in its annual report filed this year, the company said that "public resistance" could damage its business.

Equifax sued for violating Wyoming Consumer Protection Act

Texto completo: The Wyoming Attorney General's Office filed suit against Equifax last week for allegedly violating the Wyoming Consumer Protection Act. The suit stems from a 2017 data breach that affected 243,504 Wyoming residents. 
CHEYENNE – The Wyoming Attorney General’s office filed suit last week against Equifax Inc. for allegedly violating the Wyoming Consumer Protection Act.
The lawsuit filed in Laramie County District Court alleges Equifax partook in unfair and deceptive trade practices in connection with “consumer transactions prohibited by the Wyoming Consumer Protection Act.”
The case comes as Equifax reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in connection with its 2017 data breach that compromised the information of 147 million people, according to the New York Times. The lawsuit was settled for up to $700 million, and people can fill out a claim form on Equifax’s website to collect damages, if they are eligible.
According to court documents filed here July 22:
Equifax is a credit reporting company based out of Georgia. It was founded in 1899, and is the oldest and largest consumer credit reporting agency. The company analyzes personal information from more than 820 million consumers and 91 million businesses globally.
On March 8, 2017, Equifax was notified by the open-source software company Apache Struts, which the company used to operate its website, that there was an error in the software that made the website vulnerable to hackers. Apache Struts provided a patch for its software that would fix the vulnerability, which Equifax failed to apply.
On Sept. 8, 2017, Equifax announced that its network security infrastructure had been breached, and people’s information was compromised. The breach was a result of Equifax failing to fix the Apache Struts software.
Once the hackers were able to get inside of Equifax’s network, they also were able to take advantage of other network security failures in the company’s system and steal more consumer information.
A total of 243,504 of the 147 million people affected by the breach are Wyoming residents. The consumer information compromised includes Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers, credit card numbers and credit dispute documents.
The breach caused substantial harm to consumers by exposing personal data that increases the risk of identity theft. The harm included economic and non-economic damages, such as products people have purchased to protect their identities, as well as services such as credit freezes, credit monitoring and more.
People affected by the breach have also lost wages through the steps they needed to take to protect their identities, or, in other cases, where money was stolen due to identify theft from the breach. This also includes wages lost in the process to restore stolen identities.
The suit claims Equifax failed to take the steps necessary to protect consumer information by not utilizing the available software patch after it was notified of the vulnerability.
Nowadays, people don’t choose to have their information compiled by Equifax, but anyone who has had a financial transaction in the past few decades – apartment rental, home loans, car purchases, credit cards accounts and more – have likely had an Equifax credit report.
Due to this, it’s not possible to avoid having Equifax compile sensitive personal information.
As a result, according to the attorney general, Equifax violated the Wyoming Consumer Protection Act by making false and misleading statements to consumers regarding its data protection, failed to adequately inform consumers regarding data protection practices and failed to take reasonable steps to protect consumer information.
The suit is asking for $10,000 in civil penalties for each violation of the act and enhanced civil penalties of $15,000 for each violation of the act pertaining to older people or people with disabilities.
It is also asking for actual damages or money restoration for all affected people at trial and any other judgement the court deems fit.

Texto completo: La semana pasada, 3,282 empresas de todo el país recibieron “Avisos de inspección (NOI)” de la oficina de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ), según el director interino, Matthew Albence .
El funcionario había adelantado a The New York Times que había investigaciones a ese número de empresas, pero no dio detalles.
Expertos de la firma Leech Tishman Fuscaldo & Lampl LLC indicaron que ICE envió “silenciosamente NOI” a las empresas, lo cual llamaron una “redada silenciosa” contra los empleadores.
“Las industrias que se vieron afectadas la semana pasada incluyeron restaurantes, procesamiento de alimentos, fabricación de alta tecnología y agricultura” , indicaron los expertos en un artículo en el sitio especializado en temas jurídicos lexology.com.
“La emisión de NOI no es sorprendente, dado que ICE ha aumentado hasta en cinco veces el número de las auditorías I-9 en el año fiscal 2018, y la reciente emisión de cartas de ‘no coincidencia’ de la Administración del Seguro Social esta primavera”, apunta el texto.
Los expertos brindan algunos consejos a los empresarios para mantener en orden su documentación, ya que los agentes se enfocan en buscar cualquier omisión que haga sospechar la contratación de inmigrantes indocumentados .
“Si una empresa ha recibido un NOI de ICE, solo tiene tres días hábiles para responder. Las multas por infracciones de la I-9 pueden oscilar entre $548 y $4,384 por delito para los infractores por primera vez”, advirtieron. “Las sanciones penales también pueden aplicarse a los dueños de negocios que a sabiendas emplean a trabajadores no autorizados” .
Los especialistas indican que estas revisiones se han vuelto más comunes y pueden tener consecuencias, ya que incluso los trabajadores con Autorización de Empleo pueden decidir renunciar ante el escrutinio.
“Responder a ICE le quita tiempo y recursos al negocio”, indican. “Las multas y cualquier noticia pública relacionada con la auditoría pueden dañar la reputación de la empresa. Es imperativo trabajar con un abogado experimentado en cumplimiento de I-9 y tener uno de guardia para que pueda estar preparado”.
El reporte no especifica las entidades donde se realizan las indagatorias, pero si un inmigrante es descubierto laborando con documentos falsos o robados será perseguido penalmente por fraude .

Texto completo: Same-day shipping is becoming the norm for online shoppers but for smaller merchants it can be a logistical nightmare.
That's where Shopify Inc. can step in, says Ric Kostick, chief executive of 100% PURE.
The natural skin care company ships up to 5,000 orders a day from its own warehouse in San Jose, California. That works fine for customers on the West Coast but it can take up to a week to get its bamboo blur powder and coconut shower gel to the rest of the U.S. The company contemplated setting up an East Coast warehouse but the prospect was technically daunting.
"The hardest thing is programming the technology to route the packages the right way and route the orders based on what a customer orders and what inventory is available at each site. Shopify has built the technology to calculate this," says Kostick, who co-founded 100% PURE in 2004. "This is something I've wanted for years."
When Shopify said in June that it was moving into the fulfillment business -- essentially charging online merchants to store and ship their products -- the shares spiked and analysts began talking about the upstart as a potential competitor to Amazon.com.
It's unlikely to become a serious threat to Amazon at this point. But many analysts believe the Canadian company's decision to add logistics to its range of online services is smart because it could help keep customers loyal, fend off competition and create an additional source of revenue. The move also could potentially pry small merchants from Amazon, which is focusing more on megabrands like Procter & Gamble Co.
"A merchant is doing tens of millions of dollars in revenue but their fulfillment is a complete mess and that could prevent them from being successful," says Taylor Sicard, a former Shopify employee who now runs a company that helps merchants set up e-commerce businesses. "It is a massive opportunity for Shopify."
Founded in 2006, Shopify had a simple pitch: Pay us $29 a month and we'll give you all the tools required to start an online business. Many Shopify customers fail, but the more successful they are, the more money Shopify makes through transaction fees and higher-priced subscription tiers. Its Shopify Plus premium service, which counts Kylie Jenner, The New York Times and 100% PURE as its customers, can cost at least $2,000 per month.
Investors love the model. Shopify shares have soared more than 1,800% since the company went public in May 2015, making it one of Canada's most successful startups. The stock has been hitting records almost daily and has a market value of $37 billion, bigger than two of Canada's oldest financial heavyweights, Manulife Financial Corp. and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
But Shopify has struggled to make a profit and is poised to report a net loss of $35 million on sales of $320 million for the second quarter on Aug. 1, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
As the company matures, meanwhile, it will be harder to sustain the average 74% year-over-year revenue growth rates it has managed over the past three years. There are also concerns that Shopify relies too heavily on a few, large merchants that use its premium services. Most of the company's customers, over 820,000 as of June, are smaller and tend to flame out on a regular basis, creating considerable churn.
That's where the fulfillment service comes in. The company has pledged to negotiate low rates with warehouses and shipping companies, then pass those savings on to its customers. In the future, Shopify could pool shipments from different merchants, making shipping faster and cheaper and gaining some of the same advantages Amazon gets from its centralized fulfillment network.
It's partnered with logistics firms to offer the service to merchants shipping orders of 10 to 10,000 items in seven US warehouses in the initial phase.
"Right now it is really important that we invest in the right growth opportunities for the future and not necessarily take our foot off the gas," says Harley Finkelstein, Shopify's chief operating officer.
Many merchants prefer using Shopify because they can create a brand on their own website, rather than being subsumed into an Amazon-style marketplace. The new fulfillment service will also let them slap their brand on the shipping cartons, something some fulfillment companies don't offer.
Kostick, who also sells his products on Amazon and uses its fulfillment network says the U.S. company provides access to one of the fastest-growing distribution channels for beauty products in the U.S., but Shopify offers more control.
"You can customize your own website however you want," he says. "Basically, you're empowered."
Jennifer Harper, who also sells sustainable cosmetics through Shopify, says she will wait until Shopify sorts out any kinks before trying the fulfillment service. Others say it could be difficult and expensive to get out of existing contracts with stand-alone services in the short term.
Shopify says it could eventually build its own warehouses. While Shopify's finance chief, Amy Shapero, has said that the company will be able to offset the cost with fees for the new service, some analysts say revenue will be limited at first because Shopify will need to offer discounts to lure merchants.
Amazon may have little to fear from Canada's most valuable tech company at this point. Still, Shopify offers a serious alternative to the U.S. leviathan.
"Amazon is all about trying to satisfy the customer," says Anurag Rana, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "They do whatever they can in their power to squeeze money out of the merchants to give it to customers. Shopify is the exact opposite. They will do whatever it takes to help the merchant and maximize their profit."

Texto completo: The videos that emerged from an Upper East Side event in October showed a disturbing scene: about a dozen men connected to a far-right group called the Proud Boys surrounding and striking a smaller group of protesters, believed to be self-described anti-fascists.
Ten members and associates of the Proud Boys, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has called a "hate group," were arrested as a result of the altercation. And this week, two are going to trial in what appears to be the first time members of the group, which have clashed with left-wing opponents in other parts of the country, will appear before a jury to face charges stemming from an attack.
Jurors, however, are unlikely to hear from any of those who were beaten.
The four victims have not cooperated with the authorities, who do not even know their names. They are identified in an indictment only as Shaved Head, Ponytail, Khaki and Spiky Belt.
Phillip Walzak, the Police Department's main spokesman, said that footage from police body cameras showed that victims refused to talk with officers who sought statements after arriving on 82nd Street as the attacks were taking place.
As a result, prosecutors have been unable to pursue charges of assault, which requires evidence of injury. Instead, the defendants have been charged with riot and with attempted assault, which requires only evidence of intent to cause injury.
The Manhattan district attorney's office is expected to lean heavily on video from multiple sources that show the defendants -- Maxwell Hare, who prosecutors said started the fighting, and John Kinsman, accused by prosecutors of being "the single most vicious of all the attackers"-- punching and kicking protesters.
"The primary evidence before the grand jury -- and the only evidence of how the physical altercation began -- was video evidence," a prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass, wrote in a court filing.
Daniel R. Alonso, a former federal prosecutor and former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said that trying a criminal case without victim testimony may be somewhat unusual, but is hardly unheard-of.
"The law doesn't specify any particular method by which the D.A. is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt," he said.
The trial is sure to be watched closely, in large part because it will explore events that fit into a broad pattern of violence defined by clashing ideologies.
"This case involves allegations of a violent clash between two opposing groups," Justice Mark J. Dwyer of State Supreme Court in Manhattan told prospective jurors on Monday.
Over the last few years, far-right groups, often denouncing communism or calling for "free speech," have fought repeatedly with a loose-knit coalition of self-described anti-fascists known as Antifa, who say that the right-wing groups are a threat that should be countered physically.
Roiling conflicts -- in places like Berkeley, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and Providence, R.I. -- have included the use of homemade shields, clubs, batons and pepper spray. In 2017, a participant in a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Va. drove a car into a crowd of protesters, killing a woman named Heather Heyer. The driver, James Fields Jr., was sentenced to life in prison in June of this year.
Members of the Proud Boys were at that rally and have shown up at other events attended by white supremacists or extremists. But leaders of the group -- which includes nationalists and libertarians who oppose Islam, feminism and liberal politics -- say they disavow racism and hate.
In June, as President Trump gave a speech in Orlando, Fla. in which he talked of an "angry, left-wing mob," Proud Boys members outside appeared to chant, "Pinochet did nothing wrong," referring to the Chilean dictator whose government tortured and killed leftists.
Soon afterward, Tim Murtaugh, director of communications for the Trump 2020 campaign, shared on Twitter a video of a Proud Boy he named as Gilbert Fonticoba, standing outside a Democratic presidential debate in Miami holding a sign saying "No socialismo, no communismo."
The Upper East Side incident took place after Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice magazine who started the Proud Boys in New York City in 2016, appeared at the Metropolitan Republican Club on 83rd Street.
Afterward, the police said, a small group of protesters circled the block attempting to intercept a large number of Proud Boys walking south on Park Avenue.
A video documentarian, Sandi Bachom, recorded part of the fighting on East 82nd Street. Footage from a man, Christopher Wright, who accompanied the Proud Boys that night, depicted some exulting afterward, and Mr. Hare shouting that he had "smashed" a victim's head.
The public reaction was swift. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew M. Cuomo condemned the Proud Boys. Its members were banned from Instagram and Facebook. In November, Mr. McInnes said he was quitting the group.
Before that, though, he insisted that Antifa members, including one who threw a plastic bottle, had ambushed the Proud Boys that night. Lawyers for several defendants made similar claims during their arraignments.
But security camera footage obtained by The New York Times showed that members of the Proud Boys initiated the encounter by charging at the protesters, who had halted some 100 feet from Park Avenue.
Five defendants have pleaded guilty to charges including riot, disorderly conduct and attempted assault and been sentenced to a conditional discharge and five days of community service.
Another, Kyle Borello, pleaded guilty to riot and attempted assault but will be allowed to withdraw those pleas and plead guilty to disorderly conduct with a sentence of time served if he completes 10 days of community service and has no new arrests for a year.
A seventh defendant, Geoffrey Young, pleaded guilty to riot and attempted assault and was sentenced to 10 months of weekend jail.
The eighth, David Kuriakose, is expected to go to trial in the fall.
Lawyers for Mr. Hare and Mr. Kinsman have signaled that they may argue that their clients believed they needed to resort to force.
"Antifa's only missing accessory was war paint," the lawyers wrote in one filing. "They gathered and lay in wait in the Upper East Side to aggressively attack the Proud Boys exiting the club."
Prosecutors have acknowledged that the Proud Boys and protesters may have both sought a confrontation or even "a violent clash" but said the Proud Boys were the first to resort to "unlawful and assaultive" acts.
"While the suspected Antifa members may or may not have taunted their assailants," prosecutors wrote, "mere insults do not constitute initial aggression."

Texto completo: Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist who leads the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, will keep his job, the institution said Thursday. The museum has closed an investigation into sexual misconduct accusations against him.
"The museum's investigation into allegations concerning Neil deGrasse Tyson is complete," a museum spokeswoman said in a brief statement. "Based on the results of the investigation, Dr. Tyson remains an employee and director of the Hayden Planetarium. Because this is a confidential personnel matter, there will be no further statements by the museum."
Tyson was accused of behaving inappropriately with two women in an article published in November on the website Patheos.
In one instance, Katelyn N. Allers, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, said she met Tyson in 2009 at a party after a gathering of the American Astronomical Society. He was examining her tattoo of the solar system, which stretches along her arm to her collarbone, and she said he followed the tattoo with his hand, putting it into her dress. He said he was looking for Pluto, she said.
Ashley Watson, who had been his assistant on the television series "Cosmos," made another accusation. She said that during a visit to his apartment, which she thought was for work purposes, he held her hand and stared into her eyes, in what he called a Native American handshake, for about 10 seconds until she pulled away. Watson said that as she was leaving, he told her, "I want you to know that I want to hug you so bad right now, but I know that if I do, I'll just want more." She subsequently quit her job.
The article also included already public allegations by Tchiya Amet el Maat, who said Tyson raped her in 1984 when they were in graduate school at the University of Texas, Austin.
Tyson responded to the allegations in a long Facebook post, in which he denied the rape and described the first two incidents as benign.
"While I don't explicitly remember searching for Pluto at the top of her shoulder, it is surely something I would have done in that situation," Tyson wrote of Allers' account. "As we all know, I have professional history with the demotion of Pluto, which had occurred officially just three years earlier. So whether people include it or not in their tattoos is of great interest to me."
Allers said she was interviewed in person for several hours by an investigator from T&M Protection Resources, a company the museum hired. She said the investigator followed up with witnesses she provided and looked into a speech Tyson gave at a conference in 2014, which she said included jokes about gay people and criticisms of conservatives.
Tyson was also investigated by Fox Broadcasting and National Geographic, which broadcast his television series "StarTalk" and "Cosmos." Those companies announced in March that their investigations were complete and that his shows would return to the air. Allers said that investigation seemed less thorough to her, just a half-hour phone call with investigators from the two networks.
Allers said she did not find the results of the museum's investigation surprising - "This is kind of the way the world works," she said - but added that there was no good possible outcome either way.
"Any time this comes up in the news - I'm sure it will, even with this outcome - I get bombarded with emails and phone calls that are pretty hateful and kind of scary," Allers said. She said she hoped the museum was "taking steps to make sure behavior like this doesn't continue to occur."
Amet was outraged by the museum's decision.
"If Neil deGrasse Tyson had raped a white woman, he would not be on TV anymore, and this woman would have received a settlement," Amet, who is Black, said in a statement.
Watson said she had declined to speak with the museum's investigators, as she was worn out from telling her story to other investigators and to news outlets. She said she just wanted to move on.
"In hindsight, I should've talk to them," she said in a text message. "Although I personally don't think the outcome would've been different."
Tyson, who has led the planetarium since 1996, did not respond to a request for comment for this article.

From rescue cat to big star

Texto completo: Taking a back seat to the Apollo 11 moon landing in our coverage of things celebrating a 50th anniversary this year leaves Morris the Cat in uncharted territory.
"He was a TV star," says Tom Van Winkle, executive director of the Hinsdale Humane Society, where the advertising feline was discovered. Morris became a household name in 1969 by strutting his stuff in the first of 58 commercials for 9Lives. "It’s pretty amazing how it still resonates with people," Van Winkle says.
It’s likely that Morris was surrendered by his owner or possibly rescued off the street in 1968. But the orange-striped Tabby won over animal trainer and handler Bob Martwick of Lombard, who stopped by the shelter in Hinsdale looking for a cat to appear in commercials for 9Lives cat food. Martwick brought the calm, some would say aloof, stray cat to a meeting with the creative team at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, and Morris made an unforgettable impression.
"He jumped on the table … and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said during his many media interviews about the cat. "The art director said, ‘This is the Clark Gable of cats.’" Voiced by actor John Erwin, who also provided the voice for the popular He-Man cartoon character in the 1980s, Morris was the wisecracking, sardonic, finicky cat, who had little tolerance for anything except 9Lives cat food.
"Oh, I remember the Morris commercials. He definitely had a special personality that most cats don’t have," says Van Winkle, who now has enough Morris goodies at the Hinsdale Humane Society for a Morris shrine.
"This is a portrait from 1974," Van Winkle says of a large framed photograph of Morris that was taken in the photo studio at the L.S. Ayres department store in Indianapolis during one of the cat’s celebrity appearances.
"This was made by the company that makes the Emmy," he says, showing off a golden trophy in the image of Morris.
That trophy was given to one of nine cats from around the nation competing to be the 9Lives cat of the year in a lavish competition held in the famed Beverly Hills Hotel. Celebrity judges included Betty White and Ed Asner, remembers Jennifer Petterson, who started her public relations career in the 1980s with the third generation of Morris the Cat as part of her work with the Edelman communications firm of Chicago. Petterson and her staff flew in coach and carried the director’s chair with "Morris" written across the back, while Martwick and Morris, in a carrier tucked under the seat, flew first-class.
"You could see tufts of his fur through the carrier," remembers Petterson, who now lives in La Grange. "You didn’t dare say who he was because people would go gaga."
Petterson, who now runs her pettersonpr.com consulting firm, was one of a select few who got to hold Morris, aside from Martwick. A no-nonsense guy who still kept the crew cut he wore as a Navy pilot during World War II, Martwick also helped discover Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-selling dog of Anheuser-Busch.
"He was a lovely man, but was quiet and looked stern," says Petterson, who also worked with dog stars such as Beethoven, Lassie and the dog on "Frasier."
The original Morris died in July of 1978 at the age of 17, and his obituary in The New York Times noted Morris was "laid to rest near Mr. Martwick’s home," apparently in a backyard ceremony befitting his unpretentious roots. Martwick died in 2001 at age 75.
All subsequent replacement look-alike Morrises have been rescue cats, and the current Morris can be found on Twitter at @MorrisApproved, on Facebook, and on YouTube with his "Cat’s Eye View" on the 9Lives Cat Food channel, which notes that "America’s choosiest cat gives back" in an effort to "Live Well & Prospurr."
In 2015, Morris was one of 10 brand mascots alongside the Green Giant, Ronald McDonald, Mr. Clean and others to be honored with "A Salute to Advertising’s Greatest Icons" at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.
During his half-century career, Morris has received thousands of fan letters, and included his paw print on his responses. He endured countless puns about his purrfect life and his catapulting to stardom. He traveled the nation, promoting feline health and animal shelters, and visiting hospitals and schools. A later Morris launched his "Morris for President" campaign in 1988 by stumping with Eleanor Mondale, took a second shot at the White House in 2012, and might actually win if he joins the 2020 race.
The original Morris had a part in Robert Altman’s 1973 film, "The Long Goodbye," and appeared alongside Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in "Shamus." Morris also is listed as the author of three books.
In addition to selling cat food, later versions of Morris worked with the American Veterinary Medical Association in Schaumburg in establishing February as Cat Health Month, and led the Morris Million Cat Rescue adoption campaign in 2006.
That activism for less fortunate cats helps explain why Morris is so fondly remembered today.
"It’s still a sense of pride for the shelter and the community that this famous cat came from us," Van Winkle says. "It’s pride for the whole community because a rescue animal made it big."

Texto completo: This State Journal editorial ran on July 24, 1969:
While President Nixon last month ordered a sweeping review of the much-criticized United States chemical and biological warfare program, the Pentagon seems to be following its familiar policy of business as usual.
Despite the loud protests in Congress and in the nation's press last spring regarding the military's unbelievable nerve gas supply and its inept handling of this lethal material, the high brass seems to be unmoved.
For the first time, the Pentagon finally acknowledged that nerve gas is stored on the island of Okinawa, but said it will all be removed. This admission came only after 25 Americans were hospitalized after an accidental discharge of highly toxic nerve gas at a depot on Okinawa.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported last week artillery shells and bombs loaded with lethal nerve gas have been shipped to major United States military forces overseas for years. ...
Before the United States becomes deeply involved in some international disaster, not to mention a major catastrophe here at home, someone in high places should call a halt.
Before President Nixon's sweeping review is completed and acted on, it just might be too late.

Texto completo: Baseball lore has it that the curveball was invented in the early 1870s, maybe as early as 1867 by Candy Cummings. There are, however, those who credit an Elmiran, John B. Stanchfield, with the honor.
According to his obituary on June 26,1921, in the New York Times, in the year 1874, "A pitcher on the Amherst baseball team, Mr. Stanchfield, is credited with having thrown the first curved ball. An elderly, strong opinionated Professor of Physics devoted a portion of his lecture one day citing formulae to prove that a horizontal curve to a hurried sphere violated all laws of nature and physics."
"Your formulae may be correct, professor," Stanchfield spoke up, "but if you come out on the diamond this afternoon, I'll prove that I can throw a curve."
The professor was placed back of the catcher that afternoon behind the end of a brick wall. Near the other end of the wall, out of sight of the physicist and the catcher, Stanchfield threw what is known as a round-house curve into the catcher's glove.
The demonstration "filled the professor with the ambition to revise his physics formulae."
J. Sloat Fassett, who described himself as an "associate and rival and political opponent and yet always the warmest of personal friends ever since we were little boys," was quoted in the June 25, 1921, Star-Gazette saying, "I do not think I will be accused of exaggerating when I say that John B. Stanchfield, at his death, was easily the leading trial lawyer in the United States, and he was regarded as at the head of the bar in the great city of New York."
Stanchfield had been prominent in politics as well as the law. Before the age of 25, he was first elected to two terms as Chemung County district attorney from 1880 to 1885. Following that, he served a term as mayor of Elmira from 1886 to 1888, and then two terms in the New York State Assembly from 1895 to 1896. In 1900, he was the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, and a year later was nominated by his party for the office of United States senator.
In addition to law and politics, he was a close, personal friend of Olivia and Sam Clemens (aka Mark Twain). Indeed, he referred to himself as "Mark Twain's lawyer." According to Matthew Seybold, of Elmira College, editor of MarkTwainStudies.org, Stanchfield's wife, Clara, was "Livy Clemens's lifelong friend and fellow Elmira College alumna, after whom she named her second daughter." Indeed, the Clemenses may have played matchmaker between Clara and John. Seybold notes that, "before Stanchfield married, John and Sam had frequented the same billiard parlors, both using aliases."
Apparently, in addition to being "amiable" drinking buddies and billiard partners, Stanchfield and Clemens enjoyed card playing and gambling. In "Mark Twain In Elmira" (Robert Jerome and Dr. Herbert Wisbey, 1977), it is reported that Clemens was playing euchre at the home of Henry H. Rogers (who ran Standard Oil and was a financial advisor and close friend of Clemens) in New York City and said, "a small stake was involved which he told us wasn't big enough to insure him his car fare home. But," Clemens said, "John Stanchfield is teaching me a brand new game, and when I get proficient in it and have it mastered, I'm going to introduce it up there, and I'll have Rogers' clothes."
Stanchfield, as noted, had an illustrious legal career. Admitted to the bar in 1878, he became a partner with David B. Hill, a former mayor and eventually governor of New York state. In 1885, when Hill became chief executive, Stanchfield became co-partners in the law firm Reynolds, Stanchfield and Collins, a forerunner of the firm Sayles & Evans in today's Elmira.
When the Chemung County Bar Association met to pay tribute at Stanchfield's death, President Boyd McDowell said, "Mr. Stanchfield proved his versatility as a lawyer in every phase of endeavor professionally ...To name the occasions when his extraordinary abilities in this direction were displayed would be to catalogue the most famous cases of the last decade and a half."
In one of his cases, Forbes v. Taylor in 1894, Stanchfield established the right of non-discrimination based on the Fifth Amendment. The circumstances of the case were that some sophomores at Cornell University, in attempting to break up a banquet of the freshmen class, had prepared to release a quantity of chlorine gas. According to a description of the case from courtlistner.com, it was a "form of that species of arrogance or outrage popularly known as hazing."
During the evening, while the banquet was in progress, the gas from two jugs in the kitchen below was released via tube through a hole bored in the ceiling and floor above. The gas caused the death of a "colored servant" (sic) and affected a number of students. Stanchfield advised his client Taylor not to answer any incriminating questions at the grand jury hearing, resulting in Taylor being charged with contempt of court. Stanchfield's position was upheld upon appeal to the Supreme Court, thus establishing a defendant's right to "plead the Fifth" (National Cyclopedia of American Biography). It meant that a witness was the one to decide what might and what might not incriminate, and not the judge before whom he was testifying.
John B. Stanchfield died at the age of 66 at his home in Islip, Long Island. He was born in Elmira in 1855, and graduated from Elmira Free Academy in 1872 going off to college and law school. He married Clara Spaulding in 1886 and had two children. In 1906, they relocated to New York City because of the necessities of his legal career. His death in 1921 came after a 10-day battle with kidney disease. He and his wife are encrypted in the mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery.
Jim Hare is a former history teacher and mayor of the City of Elmira. His column appears monthly in the Star-Gazette.

Texto completo: "McConnell has failed coal miners time after time, and now he's making them go to D.C. to ask for help. He is jeopardizing funding for folks with black lung disease. Kentuckians know this is not the way to treat miners who have worked so hard."
Amy McGrath
Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate
Editor's note: "On Politics" is the Courier Journal's new political analysis column. Reported and written by Phillip M. Bailey, the column strives to give an unbiased, behind-the-scenes look into the Bluegrass political scene.
To say that Democrat Amy McGrath provided a master class in what not to do when starting a run for U.S. Senate would be kind.
The retired-Marine-fighter-pilot-turned-politician is looking to reset, and that starts by keeping a focus on fundraising and messaging. She will skip the annual Fancy Farm picnic on Aug. 3, campaign spokesman Terry Sebastian told me, in order to keep the event's focus on the statewide constitutional races.
But she "looks forward to being on the stage and speaking as a candidate in 2020," he said.
The recent addition of the savvy Sebastian, a Kentucky government veteran who has worked as a spokesman for Attorney General Andy Beshear and State Auditor Crit Luallen, demonstrates a commitment to courting Kentucky's press corps.
McGrath may have skipped a recent interview on MSNBC, much to the delight of Team Mitch, but Sebastian points out she has continued speaking with smaller community newspapers in Kentucky's rural areas and has interviewed with statewide public radio.
Sebastian's point being, she isn't hiding.
But that's how many will take it, after McGrath's campaign started with a head-scratching argument that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell hadn't been doing enough to help President Donald Trump on things that matter to Kentuckians.
And then came a gut punch to donors and supporters when McGrath told the Courier Journal she would have supported Judge Brett Kavanaugh — a hated figure among liberal America for months — being confirmed to the Supreme Court.
McGrath is now in the unenviable position of being Team Mitch's main target while being met with skepticism from the "woke" left, who thinks she is inauthentic.
The missteps were enough for U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the state's most powerful Democrat, to invite a primary challenger. The congressman's son, Aaron, went further in the pages of his publication, the Louisville Eccentric Observer, explaining to readers "why her campaign is already over."
The next day, Mike Broihier (pronounced Broy-er), a farmer, journalist and former Marine, appeared from out of political nowhere with a slick three-minute advertisement that could give liberal voters their alternative.
Timothy Cooper is one of those disappointed Democrats, who in a letter to the Courier Journal expressed his disappointment in McGrath's rollout. He said as a Kentuckian who moved to Minnesota, he kept a close eye on McGrath's 2018 bid for Congress, and longed for an inspiring Democrat to challenge McConnell in 2020.
McGrath seemed to be the perfect contender, he said. But her debut in the Senate race forced him to scrape her bumper sticker off his vehicle and cancel plans to dip into his pocket for her campaign.
"Your authenticity is what attracted us. Your honesty. Your understanding of the issues facing Kentuckians," Cooper said in the letter. "Who are you now? Have you adopted the same political expediency of your opponents? I am writing to let you know that it's not too late for you to change back."
But McGrath's team says their candidate, who flew 89 combat missions, is staying focused under fire.
"When you roll out a campaign, you're always going to have critics and pundits," Sebastian said. "And, of course, McConnell's people are going pile on, because they're scared of her as a viable candidate."
There's still plenty of cash to rake in and time to reevaluate between now and November 2019, when Kentucky's gubernatorial race concludes.
And while local skeptics voiced apprehension at the rollout, outside of the Bluegrass borders, many donors are still impressed with McGrath's abilities.
She was recently spotted at a major fundraiser with Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, according to sources in attendance.
The stumbles were troubling because McGrath seemed ill-prepared given how Kavanaugh and the sexual assault allegations against him had been in the news for months.
But party folks see that in the rearview, said one such donor, who attended the weekend fundraiser but asked for anonymity in order to speak freely.
"All these people who are bitching about 'Oh god, it was terrible, we got to find somebody else.' She's got $4 million," the donor said. "Who the hell is going to raise that kind of money? Unless you're bringing $4 million to the table, they need to chill on the criticism."
McGrath's reset will rely heavily on populism.
She gave attention to coal miners this week, who are furious at how Congress declined to act on a tax that finances the federal Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.
It's a program that benefits disabled workers when coal companies go bankrupt and can no longer pay out medical benefits. The tax had been a $1.10 per ton tax on underground coal but reverted this year back to its 1977 level of 55cents.
Reuters reported that a group of coal miners traveled to Washington, D.C., seeking help from McConnell, who is charge of the Senate.
George Massey, a miner from Harlan County, said they "rode up here for 10 hours by bus to get some answers from" their senator but met a cold shoulder instead. He said it was a "low-down shame" how McConnell gave them just two minutes of his time.
McGrath gladly pounced on that news and used her social media to trumpet the snub.
"McConnell has failed coal miners time after time, and now he's making them go to D.C. to ask for help," McGrath tweeted on July 23. "He is jeopardizing funding for folks with black lung disease. Kentuckians know this is not the way to treat miners who have worked so hard."
Nationally, as The New York Times mentioned, there is relief among Democrats heading into 2020 that Trump isn't pressuring McConnell to adopt key proposals coming out of the House — billions of dollars on infrastructure, lowering prescription drug costs and raising the minimum wage — which just happen to mirror much of what McGrath talked about at the outset of her campaign.
The hope among McGrath's people is that by December 2019 and beyond, Kentucky will think more about McConnell's coal miner slights, their own interests and her populist message than about those first two weeks.
And it won't hurt for McGrath to regularly remind us that she used to kill terrorists in F-18 fighter jets for a living.
When Tom Cruise dusted off his 1986 leather jacket to unveil the new "Top Gun" trailer, McGrath — whose call sign was "Krusty," by the way — seemed ready to be a "Maverick" co-pilot.
"Cool fighter jet scenes," McGrath tweeted. "... Will we see female carrier pilots this time?"

Reining in &#xa0;the new robber barons

Texto completo: The Big Four tech companies are finally getting the attention they deserve from the U.S. government.
While European regulators have been aggressive, those in the U.S. have been slow off the mark as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple accumulated vast market power. That began to change in the past few months as controversies swirled over disinformation, political bias, privacy breaches and misuse of personal information. Last week brought two potentially significant developments.
The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday fined Facebook $5 billion for violating a 2011 privacy settlement and imposed a series of oversight measures for the social network’s collection and handling of user data as part of a new agreement with the company. Facebook ran afoul of the 2011 settlement by allowing Cambridge Analytica, a British firm consulting for the Trump presidential campaign, to mine the personal information of users, without their knowledge or permission. The firm used that data to build profiles of American voters.
While a $5 billion fine sounds enormous, it is but a fraction of the company’s $56 billion in annual revenue. And Facebook’s ability to collect, share and use personal information was not restricted in any way.
As a result, some privacy advocates view the settlement as little more than a slap on the wrist. But it could signal a more aggressive regulatory stance by the FTC.
Earlier in the week, the Justice Department announced that it would begin an antitrust review into whether the internet giants had acted to stifle competition and are harming consumers. As The New York Times reported, this is a potentially significant shift in how antitrust law is interpreted and applied. For decades, the test has basically been whether consumers pay higher prices as a result of anticompetitive behavior in the marketplace. That allowed tech companies to largely escape scrutiny because Google and Facebook do not charge users, and one of Amazon’s big selling points is charging low prices.
But it has become clear that these tech behemoths have the power to harm consumers in ways other than pricing. Misusing personal information and failing to keep it secure are two. So is allowing a social network to be used to spread disinformation. Other examples: In Amazon’s case, its low prices and vast reach have devastated local retailers, reducing consumer choice in shopping. Facebook and other social media platforms have helped to cripple mainstream local news organizations while profiting from their content, to the great detriment of consumers of news — and American democracy.
There is a long way to go to rein in the tech giants, much less break them up, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., proposes in her presidential campaign. These companies, after all, have the wherewithal to field an army of lawyers and lobbyists to protect their turf.
But as Warren points out, nearly half of all e-commerce is transacted through Amazon and nearly 70 percent of all internet traffic flows through sites owned by Google or Facebook. Those companies are the contemporary equivalents of the Gilded Age powerhouses such as Standard Oil.
Antitrust laws were the Progressive Era’s response to the need to ensure competition, and that imperative has not changed.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — My take after watching the Democratic candidates for president drive their campaigns across Iowa: The front-runners have paths full of potholes, and the second-tier players are stuck in second gear.
Add to that a troubling analysis from Nate Cohn in the New York Times: Trump is closer to re-election than you would think, based on Electoral College projections.
Here are four factors, in order of significance, that I believe are plaguing Democrats:
►Socialism. Sen. Bernie Sanders' definition of socialism poses no threat whatsoever to Americans or our democracy. Yet, the word has become so toxic, so bastardized, so perfectly suited to President Donald Trump's negative sloganeering, that the 2020 election could hinge on a single word. Mix in the ill-timed posturing of four progressive congresswomen known as The Squad, and you have a situation that is perplexing Democrats and uniting conservatives.
2020 X factor is (old) age
►Health care. It's an issue on which Democrats should score handily. Yet, one wrinkle in so-called Medicare for All, authored by Sanders and embraced by several other candidates — that Americans would lose their current private coverage even if they like it — is polluting the discussion. Republicans have no plan, but now they have a fear-based attack theme: Socialists want to take away your medical insurance.
Repeating history: 2020 Democrats are repeating Hillary's 2016 mistake with Trump supporters: Today's talker
►Economy. Defeating an incumbent president is difficult, and ousting one during a period of ultra-low unemployment and a thriving stock market is even harder. However, Democrats have a compelling case to make: Wages remain low, Trump's tax schemes have disproportionately benefited the wealthy, and his approach to international trade is likely to disrupt and damage the American economy in the long run. Plus he's driving up the debt. But it's asking a lot of voters to see this financial forest given there are so many seemingly healthy trees.
►Age. This is 2020's X factor. We've come to understand that elected officials, along with Supreme Court justices, can serve effectively into their 70s and even 80s. The problem for Democrats isn't the actual age of their leading candidates, per se, it's how these people "play," as Hollywood would put it. Donald Trump (74 at the next Inauguration Day) comes off as being more energetic and alert than Joe Biden (who would be 78).
I have no way of knowing how mentally dexterous Biden is, but what I see isn't reassuring. He continues to fumble on the trail as he did in the first debate, prompting concern that this condition will worsen with, yes, age. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren seem spry, but in January 2021 he’ll be 79 and she'll be 71.
Double-header in Detroit
The debates in Detroit, coming Tuesday and Wednesday on CNN, might provide some clarity. Sanders and Warren will likely dominate the first night, but can they separate themselves philosophically while also deflecting criticism of the "socialist" agenda? The following night Biden will find himself wedged — figuratively as well as physically — between Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Both have stepped up criticism of Biden's record on racial issues.
Harris essentially doubled her standing in polls following the June debates and she raised $12 million in the second quarter. But that was less than half of what South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg collected. In fact, among those giving $200 or more, Buttigieg outperformed Harris in her home state of California — not a good sign.
The debates could provide what golfers call "moving day" up the leaderboard for candidates I found to be impressive on the ground in Iowa: Buttigieg, Sens. Michael Bennet and Amy Klobuchar, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. However, with 10 competitors on the stage each night, it won't be easy.
How Dems can dump Trump: Republican: I'm telling Democrats how to beat Trump in 2020. It's Job One so get over it.
If Harris can pull off another strong debate performance, she will be hard to dismiss. But at campaign appearances, I found her soft on some subjects and equivocal on certain questions.
Who could clean Trump's clock?
At this point, Democrats seem to be grooming a better crop of potential vice presidential candidates than ticket-toppers. Bennet, Booker, Klobuchar, Harris and Castro would each make splendid running mates if paired with the proper presidential nominee. Of course, no one runs for veep so far ahead of the first voting in February — or, at least no one dares to admit it.
Donald Trump is arguably the worst president, and the most dangerous, in U. S. history. He should be planning his retirement at Mar-a-Lago or Leavenworth rather than taking any comfort in speculation about another Electoral College victory. The right opponent should clean his clock.
Yet, looking at the Democrats' field of 25 presidential aspirants, what comes to mind is Casey Stengel's query as he surveyed the players on his 1962 Mets: "Can't anybody here play this game?"

A$AP Rocky to stand trial for assault in Sweden

Texto completo: The rapper A$AP Rocky was charged Thursday with having committed an assault causing actual bodily harm June 30 in central Stockholm, Swedish prosecutors said in a statement.
The prosecution will proceed "despite claims of self-defense and provocation," the public prosecutor for Stockholm, Daniel Suneson, said in an email.
The rapper will remain in custody until a trial begins Tuesday, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement.
The punishment for Rocky could include a fine based on his daily earnings or a maximum two years in prison, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Annika Collin, said in a telephone interview.
Two members of Rocky's entourage also face a trial.
The development will sharpen the focus on a case that started as a street brawl, but has ballooned into a diplomatic incident, with Sweden facing accusations of racism and human rights abuses for its treatment of the rapper.
Rocky, 30, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, is accused of assaulting Mustafa Jafari in Stockholm on June 30 after an altercation in the street that was captured on video. The rapper and two other men were detained on July 5 as prosecutors investigated the matter.
Slobodan Jovicic, Rocky's lawyer, said in a telephone interview Thursday that the rapper acted in self-defense. On July 2, Rocky posted two videos on Instagram that Jovicic said show Jafari and another man following and harassing the rapper, despite being repeatedly asked to stop.
But Suneson, the prosecutor, said Jafari had been punched, kicked and struck with a glass bottle in an attack that lasted several minutes.
Suneson said he had more evidence than the video clips that were published to Rocky's Instagram and on websites including TMZ. That included footage from CCTV cameras and witness statements, he added.
Rocky's case was initially treated as a minor incident, but rapidly escalated after the rapper was detained and tour dates were canceled. Pop stars including Justin Bieber shared a Change.org petition created by Rocky's team that demanded his release. More than 600,000 people have signed.
As the clamor to free Rocky grew, the case went all the way to the White House: On Saturday, President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden to discuss the rapper's detention.
Trump said on Twitter that he had told the prime minister he would "personally vouch" for Rocky's bail if the rapper were to be released. Sweden has no system of bail and usually keeps foreigners accused of crimes in detention because of the flight risk.
Lofven's office said in a statement Saturday that the 20-minute phone call had been cordial but that the prime minister insisted he would not intervene, and "underlined that in Sweden everyone is equal before the law."
The storm did not settle despite Trump's intervention. "I don't want to call the race card," Renee Black, Rocky's mother, told the gossip site TMZ on Monday, "but that's what it's looking like."
"If it walk like a duck and it quack like a duck, then it's a duck," she added.
Lovette Jallow, a human-rights activist in Sweden and commentator on race issues, said in a telephone interview Tuesday that "racism in Sweden is very problematic." "But it is not a case of racism in the A$AP Rocky case," she added.
On Thursday, Expressen, a Swedish newspaper, reported that Jafari is 19 and comes from Afghanistan.

Texto completo: Manuel Gámez, el hombre hondureño cuya hija, Heydi Gámez García, murió luego de intentar suicidarse, podrá permanecer 30 días mas en Nueva York con su familia antes de detener que volver a un centro de detención , ha reportado la cadena de noticias CNN.
Gámez fue detenido por las autoridades de inmigración en junio cuando intentó cruzar la frontera, lo que sumió a su hija de 13 años en un delicado estado emocional.
El migrante hondureño fue llevado a un centro de detención de migrantes en Houston, Texas, pero recibió un permiso especial el pasado 13 de julio para darle el ultimo adiós a su hija, quien había sido declarada con muerte cerebral luego de que intentara quitarse la vida en Nueva York, donde vivía con unos familiares.
El permiso que las autoridades le habían concedió a Gámez iba a expirar este sábado, no obstante, las autoridades le han dado 30 días mas para que permanezca con su familia luego de que la menor fuera desconectada del soporte vital la semana pasada.
Aníbal Romero, abogado de Manuel Gámez, ha dicho que la extensión de 30 días le permitirá a su equipo legal ganar tiempo para buscar la manera con la que el migrante pueda quedarse en Estados Unidos.
Gámez, de 34 años, había vivido previamente en Nueva York por ocho años, pero tuvo que volver a Honduras en 2014 para encargarse de su hija, a quien había dejado con los abuelos.
El hombre ha dicho que tuvo que retornar a su país de origen porque miembros de la MS-13 mataron a su padre luego de que este se negara a pagarles al ser extorsionado.
Gámez envió a su hija a Estados Unidos en 2015 para protegerla de la violencia en Honduras pero decidió quedarse en el país centroamericano en caso de que deportaran a la menor.
En septiembre de 2015, luego de pasar casi dos meses en centros de acojo de menores, la niña, de 9 años en ese entonces, pudo llegar a Nueva York, donde la recibieron unos familiares. Su tía, Zoila Gámez, quien también decidió dejar Honduras, logró reunirse con ella meses después, ha reportado el diario The New York Times.
El padre emprendió el camino de vuelta a Estados Unidos en 2016, luego de que a la menor le concedieran el asilo debido a las amenazas por parte de pandillas en contra de su familia.
A diferencia de la travesía en la que se había embarcado nueve años atrás, Gámez terminó detenido en McAllen, Texas.
Gámez le dijo a los agentes de inmigración que temía por su vida. Sin embargo, las autoridades le respondieron que su miedo no era creíble y lo deportaron en noviembre de 2016.
El migrante hondureño fue detenido una vez más en septiembre de 2017 cerca a Santa Teresa, Nuevo México. Fue deportado después de pasar 45 días bajo custodia .
Con cada intento fallido, la menor empezó a perder la esperanza de reunirse con su padre y a presentar síntomas de estrés emocional.
En junio de este año, Gámez fue arrestado por la Patrulla Fronteriza luego de entrar ilegalmente al país. Según los familiares de la menor, la noticia de la detención le causó gran impacto, al punto que perdió el apetito y no quiso salir de su habitación por varios días.
No obstante, la situación se tornó aun mas complicada el pasado 3 de julio, cuando trató de quitarse la vida. Fue una de sus tías, preocupada por su estado emocional, quien entró a la habitación para ofrecerle algo de comer y se encontró con la aterradora escena: la niña colgada de un cable.
Según los médicos, la menor estaba “neurológicamente devastada”. La adolescente ha sido declarada con muerte cerebral. Su padre, quien emprendió el viaje a Estados Unidos varias veces sin éxito, recibió el 13 de julio un permiso especial de 14 días para poder despedirse de su hija moribunda.
Cuando Gámez aterrizó en el aeropuerto de Newark desconocía el estado de la niña.
Al enterarse del grave estado de salud de la menor, el padre hondureño decidió desconectarla luego de darle el ultimo adiós.
Los órganos de la menor fueron donados por la familia Gámez.
“Como padre no tienes esperanzas ni sueños para ti mismo, todos tus sueños son para tus hijos,” le dijo Gámez a The New York Times antes de la muerte de la niña.

Texto completo: Germany In Berlin, apps are reducing food waste. Food-sharing apps help connect people with restaurants that will sell their leftover, unsold food at a discount. Too Good To Go, one of the most popular apps, is used all over Europe. The main motivation for its users: climate change. A Too Good To Go spokesperson told The Associated Press that since the app launched in 2015, it has prevented 14 million meals from being thrown away, a savings of 35,000 tons of carbon released in the production of that food. (The Associated Press)
United States For the first time, Americans used more energy derived from renewable sources than from coal. The Energy Information Administration reported last month that in April, solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy surpassed that of coal. Renewable energy costs continue to decrease, and solar and wind are now consistently cheaper than fossil fuels in many parts of the world. One caveat: Some coal plants were out of commission for routine maintenance in April and coal will again be the second-largest source of electricity this summer; natural gas is No. 1. But proponents say the fall in the cost of renewable energy is a promising trend. (Energy Information Administration)
Tanzania Elephant and rhinoceros populations are rebounding here. Since 2015, the government has cracked down on criminal networks involved in poaching. In the six years before 2015, Tanzania’s elephant population declined by 60% because of an uptick in ivory demand on the black market. A special anti-poaching task force operating since 2016 has seen elephant numbers increase from 43,330 in 2014 to more than 60,000 today. Rhinos, a severely endangered species, have also seen modest population gains. (Reuters)
Afghanistan A school in the remote Yakawlang district, 170 miles west of Kabul, has opened its doors wide to girls’ education. In Afghanistan, only one-third of girls go to school, but at Rustam School, girls make up two-thirds of the 500 students there. Since the fall of the Taliban, which opposed education for girls and women, a passion for learning, especially among girls, has grown in Yakawlang. The school’s principal says he believes boys and girls are equal and should be treated as such. He taught his own wife how to read and write under the Taliban regime, and has four daughters. Although boys and girls are traditionally taught separately, in Rustam they are taught together in order to prepare them for coeducational classrooms in college. Despite the school having no electricity or computers, more than 90% of graduating classes have gone on to college in recent years. (The New York Times)
Uruguay Punta de Rieles prison helps inmates become entrepreneurs, and the project is showing signs of promise for their reentry into society. Luis Parodi, the prison’s director, says the model is a product of 30 years of trial and error. It serves as an alternative to conventional confinement, aiming to encourage character reformation. One inmate told a reporter that Punta de Rieles is an oasis from the world of violence that is often seen in prisons. From candy stores to carpentry shops, inmates can employ peers and sell their goods inside and outside the prison. The inmates keep 70% of the profits and gain full access to the funds after release. Two former inmates continue to operate a bakery in Punta de Rieles and employ 50 to 70 people. (The Associated Press)

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- The rapper Nipsey Hussle died with a dream for his South Los Angeles neighborhood. The strip mall he owned -- where he was gunned down in March -- would be razed, and an apartment tower and retail complex would rise in its place, anchored by his Marathon clothing store.
All of this was part of Hussle's promise to the area that raised him, at a time of sweeping change across the city: Keep the neighborhood in the hands of the neighborhood.
"Our biggest thing was for us purchasing property and using our influence and keeping businesses in the epicenter of where the gentrification is happening," said Jorge Peniche, who was a partner with Hussle in his record label, All Money In.
Now that Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, is gone, moving forward has fallen to his main business partner, David Gross, a Los Angeles businessman. But those plans have been complicated by revelations of a longstanding investigation into gang activity at the property by the Los Angeles Police Department and the city attorney's office.
[ Sign up for our daily newsletter about news from California here. ]
Hussle, a one-time member of the Rollin' 60s Crips street gang, had been working with the city to quell gang violence. Still, the city considered his property as a stronghold of the gang, and has demanded Mr. Gross take measures to stop the crime it said has occurred there over years, according to letters between city officials and owners of the property obtained by The New York Times.
In the months after Hussle's killing, police officers on the street saw a rise in criminal activity at the property, including a second killing (a stabbing on June 16), a robbery at gunpoint, and the roughing up of tourists who had stopped by to pay respects to Hussle, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation who declined to be named.
Hussle's story has exposed deep divisions within the city's leadership, underscored by the reaction after his death, with city officials praising the rapper as a model for the neighborhood, even as he was under investigation. The case has also divided the investigators themselves.
For instance, Hussle's killing and the aftermath emboldened prosecutors in the city attorney's office to push forward, and they prepared civil litigation against Mr. Gross, seeking to force him to take steps to improve safety at the property. Such litigation is one tool in the city's efforts to combat gangs.
But the police chief, Michel Moore, withheld his support for that approach out of concern that such a move could anger residents of South Los Angeles, according to the law enforcement official briefed on the matter. That effectively stalled the investigation.
The police instead decided to negotiate directly with Mr. Gross, whom they met with earlier this month. They insisted that he hire armed guards and install security cameras accessible to the police. Mr. Gross resisted taking these steps out of fear that members of the Rollin' 60s would consider him an agent of the police, according to correspondence between the police and city attorney's office obtained by The Times.

A spokesman for the city attorney's office declined to comment. Josh Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Police Department, said, "We are continuing our work with the property owner in a productive manner to ensure the safety of the community and the safety of that neighborhood."

About six weeks before Hussle was killed, the city attorney's office sent a later, dated Feb. 13, to Mr. Gross listing a number of crimes it had documented at the property, which it said was a hub for the Rollin' 60s Crips.
"The property is known as a 'hangout' for the Rollin' 60s criminal street gang," the letter said, "and has been the site of many violent and/or unlawful incidents including, without limitation, attempted murder, shootings, robberies, batteries, and unlawful firearm detention."
Mr. Gross did not meet with city authorities until after Hussle was killed in the strip mall's parking lot in late March. In a letter in early July, Mr. Moore, the police chief, wrote to Mr. Gross that the strip mall "has been a location of concern due to the amount of criminal activity occurring. Multiple calls for police services involving assaults, batteries and shootings have been generated at the location."
The police have said Hussle's killing was the result of a personal dispute, not a feud between gangs. The man charged with killing Hussle, Eric Holder, is also alleged to be a member of the Rollin' 60s. An eyewitness said he shot Hussle after a discussion in which Hussle told Mr. Holder that there were rumors he was a "snitch."
Shortly before he died, Hussle and Mr. Gross stood in front of the Marathon store for a closing scene of a documentary they were making, promoting their plan to leverage a provision of President Trump's signature tax cuts to help finance a series of investments in the Crenshaw district and other economically struggling neighborhoods across the country.
Before his death, Hussle and Mr. Gross were preparing to start a fund to invest in so-called opportunity zones, a creation of the 2017 tax overhaul. The zones, designated by state officials and blessed by the Treasury Department, are scattered across urban, suburban and rural areas that the government considers distressed, in every state. By investing in real estate or certain businesses in those zones, investors can realize potentially lucrative reductions in federal capital gains taxes.
The fund, called Our Opportunity, is still trying to pull together investors, including the rapper T.I. and the radio host Charlamagne tha God, to use the zone provisions to develop real estate in South Los Angeles.
They also hope to replicate the start-up incubator and co-working space Vector 90, a sort of WeWork for urban African-American communities that Mr. Gross and Hussle opened in Crenshaw last year, in several additional cities. The original Vector 90 sprawls over two stories of brick and exposed wood beams, with Hussle's rap lyrics rising up its central staircase; it reopened in June after it closed in the wake of Hussle's shooting.
"The opportunity zone legislation just kind of turbocharged" their expansion plans, Mr. Gross said in an interview in the spring. "We're going to create this intellectual, cultural anchor in the community." (Mr. Gross did not respond to requests for comment for this article.)
It's unclear what happens now, either with the investigation or Hussle's efforts to use local investment to head off the forces of gentrification.
"We've seen this play out in other areas of Los Angeles," said Mr. Peniche, the partner in Hussle's record label, referring to gentrification. "And we see there's very few remnants of the original people who lived there."

Texto completo: Chris Hughes used to huddle with Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room building Facebook from scratch. Now, he's huddling with regulators to explain why Facebook needs to be broken up.
In recent weeks, Mr. Hughes has joined two leading antitrust academics, Scott Hemphill of New York University and Tim Wu of Columbia University, in meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department and state attorneys general. In those meetings, the three have laid out a potential antitrust case against Facebook, Mr. Wu and Mr. Hemphill said.
For nearly a decade, they argue, Facebook has made "serial defensive acquisitions" to protect its dominant position in the market for social networks, according to slides they have shown government officials. Scooping up nascent rivals, they assert, can allow Facebook to charge advertisers higher prices and can give users worse experience.
Mr. Hughes's involvement stands out because few founders have gone on to argue for the dismantling of their company. As the scrutiny of the world's biggest tech companies has intensified in the last year, many of the complaints about them have come from competitors or academics.
On Wednesday, Facebook announced that the F.T.C. had started an antitrust investigation into the company. The Justice Department has also started a broad antitrust review of the technology industry, as have lawmakers. And on Thursday, some state attorneys general met with the Justice Department to discuss competition in the industry.
It is unclear just what role Mr. Hughes, who left Facebook more than a decade ago and has become increasingly critical of Facebook in public, is playing in the pitches to regulators. In the slide presentation, a "Who We Are" page lists Mr. Hughes as the third member of the group. The page concludes with the bullet point, "Speaking only for ourselves, not a client."
But Mr. Hughes could, for example, provide investigators with leads to current and former company employees and competitors to interview or subpoena. A partly redacted copy of the slides was provided to The New York Times, with names of the people to interview blacked out. Mr. Wu and Mr. Hemphill have shared the redacted version of the slides with some other antitrust experts. One of them, who asked not to be identified, sent it to The Times.
Neither Mr. Hemphill nor Mr. Wu would discuss Mr. Hughes's involvement, other than to confirm he attended the presentations.
"He has been an important contributor to thinking about these issues," Mr. Hemphill said.
Mr. Hughes declined to comment, as did Facebook.
Mr. Hughes, who made hundreds of millions of dollars from his time at Facebook, has become an outspoken critic of the company's market power and the need for the government to take action. In a lengthy Op-Ed article for The Times in May, he wrote, "We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well-intentioned the leaders of these companies may be."
Mr. Hughes went on to describe the power held by Facebook and its leader Mr. Zuckerberg, his former college roommate, as "unprecedented." He added, "It is time to break up Facebook."
The narrative from the two academics and Mr. Hughes in their presentation is that Facebook, founded in 2004, succeeded in its earlier years by simply outdoing its competitors, like Myspace, by providing a superior social network including fewer ads and promises of protecting users' privacy.
But by 2010, Facebook was scrambling to adapt to the shift to smartphone computing and the rise of new social network services, like photo sharing. The company's response, the presentation says, was its program to buy upstart rivals. The biggest deals were for Instagram, the photo sharing service, for $ 1 billion in 2012, and WhatsApp, the messaging service, for $ 19 billion in 2014.
At a House antitrust subcommittee hearing last week, a Facebook executive, when asked to name its rivals, hesitated and did not offer a list. Mr. Wu, who also testified, said, "Facebook can't name its competitors because they bought them."
But in his written testimony, the executive, Matt Perault, director of public policy at Facebook, listed an array of competitors, including Snapchat, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube. And he described major acquisitions of companies like WhatsApp and Instagram as "investments in innovation," new services for consumers that Facebook strengthened and expanded with money and resources.
The theory in the presentation by the two academics and Mr. Hughes is that an acquisition strategy can be an illegal tactic to shield a monopoly from competition. An upstart company, they say, need not be a full-fledged competitor at the time of the purchase, merely a potential threat.
The antitrust precedents, they say, stretch back to Standard Oil, which was built with a string of corporate purchases over decades, before the government broke it up in 1911.
"There is a direct connection between the conduct and the remedy -- undo the acquisition," Mr. Hemphill said in an interview.
The professors and Mr. Hughes are not alone in focusing on Facebook's company-buying campaign. In March, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, wrote to the F.T.C., urging the agency begin an investigation of Facebook.
His first suggested line of inquiry was the social network's acquisition campaign. "It is clear that allowing Facebook to purchase Instagram and WhatsApp has deprived users of critical competition," Mr. Cicilline wrote.
Whether the F.T.C. will pursue the company-buying line of investigation is uncertain. The agency's investigations, which can last months or years, are largely conducted in secret. A representative for the F.T.C. declined to comment.
But antitrust experts say it may be the most promising target of inquiry, focused on a handful of acquisitions rather than a broad review of the company's conduct in general.
"It is a plausible theory, and it has the elements of an antitrust case," said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official in the Justice Department.
But the key, Mr. Kimmelman said, would be assembling evidence to show that Facebook conducted an intentional campaign to buy companies regarded as future threats, even if they were fledgling start-ups at the time. And then, he said, the agency would want to be able to demonstrate economic harm, like higher prices for advertisers and degraded service for users.
"This is not an easy case," said Mr. Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the consumer group Public Knowledge.

Texto completo: Headnote FASHION
This week, we present our inaugural edition of Jews of Philly Fashion, introducing you to the Chosen few who dress our city. They might mix wool and linen, but they've got some hard opinions on mixing stripes with florals. In this space, well talk to designers, sellers, buyers, influencers, models and more. For our first week, we talked to Alex Gushner, the fourth-generation men's buyer at Boyds.
WHEN ALEXANDER GUSHNER founded Boyds with his brothers in 1938, his prior experience in sales was mostly restricted to cigars, along with some shirts and ties.
As for Alex Gushner, 29, his experience before joining the family business was a little different. He was briefly in New York, working for the Italian label Ermenegildo Zegna, before he returned in 2014 to help rebrand and revitalize Boyds. The store's sales, as his father, president of Boyds Kent Gushner told The New York Times last year, are still 80% men's clothing. Gushner the younger helped oversee a $10 million renovation in 2018.
What is your favorite piece of clothing?
I have a Tom Ford suit that I love.
What's something you can't believe you used to wear?
I had a purple paisley tie that I recently found buried in the back of my closet. Kind of funny how your tastes and style changes as time goes by, because there's no way in the world I'd wear a purple paisley tie.
What's your go-to High Holiday outfit?
I keep it pretty simple, with a solid navy blazer and a pair of gray dress pants. The High Holidays aren't the time for a fashion statement.
Is there a current fashion trend that you detest?
Why do people wear beanies indoors?
What would you be doing if you weren't at Boyds?
Well, I love fashion, so probably working for a brand in New York City, but I've always wanted to live abroad, so I would probably have considered relocating to London or Milan.
Will the Phillies make the playoffs?
100%.
What item of clothing should more people be wearing?
I believe that more men should wear a sport jacket when eating in a restaurant. It doesn't have to be a dressy jacket, but women are always dressed to the nines and I just think men look incomplete without one. Casual can still look elegant.
Whose style do you admire?
Brunello Cucinelli's style, for me, is the best. He strikes the balance of casual and dressy.
What talent would you most like to have?
I wish I were a great impersonator. �

Art of Self-Defense examines, satirizes toxic masculinity

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Director Riley Stearns says he didn't realize he was making a perfect movie for 2019 when he started writing "The Art of Self-Defense four years ago.
But his darkly comedic riff on toxic masculinity starring Jesse Eisenberg as a timid and "weak man who takes up karate just kept becoming more relevant. The Harvey Weinstein allegations broke during the shoot in 2017 and the #MeToo movement became a phenomenon.
"It was kind of weird that this idea that I had been feeling was very personal to me was really starting to spread into a direct discussion, Stearns said. "More and more people are relating to the film in ways that I originally wouldn't have intended, which is hugely humbling and very interesting to see.
"The Art of Self-Defense is currently in 540 theaters nationwide, where it's finding a healthy audience amid all the flashier blockbusters and superhero films in the multiplex.
Eisenberg's character Casey Davies is mocked even for his "feminine sounding name. After getting brutally beaten one night by horde of masked motorcyclists, he stumbles on a local dojo run by an over-the-top alpha played by Alessandro Nivola and signs up for classes. And things take an unexpectedly dark turn.
"There's an absurdity to him because he's timid in such an extreme way and aggressive in such an extreme way, Eisenberg said. "Casey is a product of this very unusual world. As much as I loved the character, I also loved the world he exists in, which is a world where people speak in this very unusual, blunt, earnest way.
Imogen Poots plays the film's sole main female character, an instructor at the dojo who despite all her skills has not been promoted to black belt. Sterns did this knowingly, but also made a concerted effort to make sure his below the line team was predominantly women.
"It's a film about men, starring men, written by a man. Everything about it was so overtly masculine, which I knew, I was making fun of it, but still at the end of the day was not going to be on the side of films passing the Bechdel Test, Stearns said. "My intent then was to say, let's find the best people for the job to take on these department head jobs but also really try to focus on finding the best women for the jobs as well, to really try to counteract that. I just knew I didn't want it to be a set full of men. It was really important for me to have that female perspective.
Both Stearns and Eisenberg see some of the changes happening in the industry as many wake up to the injustices women have been subject to for too long. Soon after filming "The Art of Self-Defense, Eisenberg found himself on the set of "The Hummingbird Project, with Salma Hayek and Erika Rosenbaum, who both allege Weinstein sexually harassed them.
He remembers that the day that Hayek was writing her New York Times op-ed on set about the alleged harassment , something else happened in another department.
"This guy on set made some misogynistic comment in the wardrobe department and was fired on the spot, Eisenberg set. "And I remember thinking, This is amazing. This day fully crystalizes the changes that are possible: Two women bravely telling their stories about a person with outsized power in our field and another guy having to be held accountable for something he did that was awful on set... I just thought, if this is sustainable this is great.

Pignanelli and Webb: Trump, more Trump and term limits

Texto completo: In the last several weeks, the country has endured incredible searing heat. But that’s not just the record-breaking weather — it’s the never-ending political controversies: Allegations of racism, immigration pressures and dramatic congressional investigations. We explore the impact on Utah.
Recently, a poll conducted by UtahPolicy.com and reported in the Deseret News indicated a majority of Utah voters disapprove of Pres. Donald Trump’s job performance and only a plurality of voters support his re-election. What does this mean for “red state” Utah politics?
Pignanelli: "Trump has a tendency to make his own weather” — Maggie Haberman, The New York Times
This poll is extremely valuable to politicos as a treasure map, detailing land mines and obstacles lurking along an election path. Obviously, Trump is the antithesis of the average Utahn in so many ways — explaining why 53% disapprove of him.
These dynamics are challenging for all candidates of either stripe in 2020. Republicans cannot be viewed as too close to the president. Yet, the survey subtly reminds Democrats to establish clear distance from their party nominee — especially if debate statements indicate campaign promises.
The GOP should be concerned as this poll highlights that 67% of millennials and Generation Z dislike the president. Also, 18-34 year-olds really do care about tolerance and diversity, demanding such behavior in officials. This is especially reflected in the younger 4th Congressional District and its lower acceptance for Trump. However, most older Utahns support the president — and they vote.
Although the poll provides a path, implementation is difficult. Republicans who stiff-arm Trump face outcry from the right as will Democrats confront criticism when maintaining distance from the other presidential candidate.
Trumps wins Utah again, while smart politicians in tougher races follow the map, thereby deftly avoiding land mines and shrewdly maneuvering through obstacles.
Webb: Trump isn’t going to lose Utah to one of the very liberal Democratic presidential candidates, but he also isn’t going to be any real help, and he might hurt, in the 4th Congressional District where Republicans hope to defeat Democratic Rep. Ben McAdams .
Attitudes about Trump basically split three ways: His base absolutely loves him and will stick with him no matter what he does. They love his political incorrectness, his brashness, his certainty, and especially his willingness to take on the news media, the establishment, illegal immigrants and foreign countries.
Another group absolutely hates everything about Trump. They hate his personality, his policies, his cockiness, his arrogance. To them he’s a juvenile delinquent.
A final group is in the middle (me among them). Most of the people in this group don’t like Trump’s personality, his incessant tweeting, his name-calling and the way he mocks other people. But they do like most of his policies, his economic success and many like his tougher stance against America’s adversaries and trade fairness.
I don’t believe Trump can win only with his base. But he seems not interested in appealing to anyone else.
For those of us in the middle group, the choice comes down to whether we like Trump’s policies enough to vote for him, despite his character flaws, or will we take a chance on an arch-liberal whose answer to every problem is more government and higher taxes.
While most Utahns were celebrating Pioneer Day last Wednesday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before two congressional committees. Does anyone in the Beehive State care?
Pignanelli: Although a weird news junkie, even I could not stomach the entire ordeal, and often switched channels for glimpses of parade floats and bands. Mueller’s testimony did not provide any clear winners and losers. One media pundit conveniently observed Mueller was neither a punching bag nor a pawn.
Muller is a decent person who cares about his country and holds concerns about foreign governments corrupting our election process. Hopefully leaders take heed. Otherwise, the greatest tragedy is allowing these attacks on America to continue.
Webb: Here’s how to re-elect Trump: Continue investigating every detail of his life. Keep holding hearings. Start impeachment proceedings. Ignore the problems facing the country and obsess about Trump. Make every news story every day about Trump, Trump, Trump.
Voters aren’t paying attention. Voters are much more concerned about health care, immigration, the economy and taxes.
Attempting to leverage frustration with politics, the United Utah Party launched an initiative petition to impose term limits on state officials. Does this effort have a chance?
Pignanelli: The biggest lesson learned from the unprecedented number of initiatives filed in 2018 is success depends upon money — mostly from out of state. Unless these resources materialize, this effort gains little traction. Further, Utah defeated the 1994 Term Limit Initiative and no one raised a peep when the statutory limitations were erased nine years later.
Webb: Successful or not, proposing a ballot measure is a good strategy to draw attention to the United Utah Party and give it a reason to exist. The party can ride this ballot proposal, get some visibility and make it an election issue if they can get it on the ballot.

Texto completo: There must have been a point in the Robert Mueller hearings when the big thinkers of CNN and MSNBC curled up on the floor in fetal positions and began breathing into brown paper bags, trying to remain calm.
Breathe. Collusion. Breathe. "Did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime." Breathe. Ted Lieu? Breathe.
Those paper bags popped in and out, out and in, when Democratic media wizard David Axelrod and Harvard Law's Laurence Tribe pronounced the Mueller hearings an unmitigated disaster for their side. And Donald Trump puffed himself up to crow.
"The Democrats had nothing," the president said after Mueller's testimony. "And now they have less than nothing."
He's already elevated the hard left of the Democratic Party -- the socialist "squad" or as I'd call them, The Gang of Four -- as his true ideological opponents in 2020. And then Democrats said Mueller failed them.
"This is delicate to say, but Mueller, whom I deeply respect, has not publicly testified before Congress in at least six years," Axelrod said on Twitter. "And he does not appear as sharp as he was then."
It was as if Axelrod had just sentenced the former special counsel to be turned into crackers.
Tribe agreed.
"Much as I hate to say it, this morning's hearing was a disaster," Tribe tweeted. "Far from breathing life into his damning report, the tired Robert Mueller sucked the life out of it. The effort to save democracy and the rule of law from this lawless president has been set back, not advanced."
That was after the morning session. It didn't really get much better in the afternoon. Politicians and pundits spent the evening in those little boxes on TV, jabbering about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin -- but Robert Mueller isn't one of them.
So what happens when liberal Democrats who despise Trump are mugged by the reality that when it comes to the Mueller report, there is no there there?
Breathe. Breathe. Stay calm. Breathe.
Mueller seemed lost in his testimony, seemingly unsure of just what was in his own vaunted report about Trump and that mythic conspiracy with Russians.
Mueller seemed confused, asking committee members to restate their questions so that he might grasp them.
"Mr. Mueller spoke haltingly as he testified," sniffed The New York Times, "blunting attacks on him by Republicans but also limiting Democrats' efforts to elevate his words and raising questions about his acuity."
Ouch. His acuity?
When the great gray lady slaps the old gray man, the lady wins.
It's all clearly unfair to Mueller. It was as if you were watching an aging uncle sitting helplessly in a dentist's chair for a root canal, his one foot kicking.
He wasn't confident in his knowledge of his own report, which was clearly staff-driven, not Mueller-driven, and having his lawyer sworn in, sitting next to him, ready to help, said as much.
Republicans pounced. Democrats flailed. Privately, those Democrats on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees should be flailing in range of their chairmen, Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff, who wanted these hearings just for the sound bites they might provide.
Mueller and the Democrats were the losers in all this.
That wasn't the Robert Mueller America knows, not the Robert Mueller who took over the FBI just before 9/11. This wasn't the Robert Mueller who served honorably and bravely in Vietnam, made his money in the law, then left lucrative private practice to prosecute criminals.
This was a Robert Mueller who seemed too old, who couldn't remember the name of the president who appointed him as U.S. attorney years ago, the Mueller who couldn't give Democrats the dramatic sound bites they so desperately wanted.
And so Democrats like Axelrod and Tribe trashed him.
The left's anxiety attacks are their own affair. It's what happens when people insist on clinging to a fantasy, that Mueller would appear and make their dreams a reality.
Mueller had warned them he wouldn't perform for them. He told them he'd stay with what was in the report, but the Democrats trotted him out anyway, and they cranked up their organ music as if he were their monkey and told him to dance.
And he wouldn't.
Is that Mueller's fault? No, it's their fault.
The Democrats said Americans didn't read the Mueller report, they wanted Mueller to give them the movie. But it wasn't "Seven Days in May." It was more like "Pee-wee's Big Adventure."
The Mueller report made it clear that there wasn't enough to prove a conspiracy with the Russians. And without a crime, all the Democrats have is their hurt feelings. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi knows it.
As Trump puffed his chest in victory, the Democrats lined up and tried to spin again Wednesday evening, but they were exhausted, and it was over.
They'll keep beating their Russian horse. But Trump and the Republicans will now move to the next phase of the story. Attorney General William Barr and FBI Inspector General Michael Horowitz are investigating the federal investigators who started it all.
"I believe what you're going to find out, you are going to find out a lot of things that were done very wrong," Trump said. "That's something you haven't been writing about. And that has to do with the other side, with this thing called 'investigate the investigators.' Let's see what happens. That's going to be very interesting."
It will be. And that's what elections are for.

Lenape Chamber Ensemble closes season

Texto completo: In Russian concert halls, one always finds a bust of Sergei Taneyev alongside those of Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms and Tchaikovsky. He was one of Russia's greatest composers and pianists of the early 20th century, yet outside of his homeland, he is perhaps the least known of any great Russian musical artist from the period.
On Saturday, July 27, the Lenape Chamber Ensemble closes its 33rd summer season with Taneyev's G Minor Piano Quintet - a colossal, monumental work, lasting nearly 50 minutes. The concert, at the Life Sciences Building at Delaware Valley University in Doylestown, also features Luigi Cherubini's Sonata No. 2 for Horn and String Quartet, featuring hornist David Jolley, and also will feature Ravel's always-welcome String Quartet in F Minor.
Born in 1856 in Vladimir, Russia, Taneyev was a brilliant pianist, although he opted for a career as a composer and teacher. The idiom of his piano quintet is late-Romantic, and is as passionate as anything from the pen of, say, Brahms or César Franck. The first movement, itself 20 minutes long, is somber and anguished. The march-like scherzo, much lighter in mood, is followed by a Largo whose main theme is a tragic tone poem. The huge finale is chock full of jagged rhythms and soaring lyrical lines, ending on a grandiose climax.
The work features Lenape favorite, pianist Marcantonio Barone, joined by violinists Nancy Bean and Cyrus Beroukhim, violist Catherine Beeson, and cellist Lloyd Smith.
David Jolley, one of the top hornists in New York City, is featured soloist in the Cherubini horn sonata. Praised by the New York Times for his "remarkable virtuosity," Jolley has traveled extensively in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, and has frequently collaborated with such groups as the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio, the Guarneri Quartet, the Beaux Arts Trio, Musicians from Marlboro, and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.
Jolley is a member of three virtuoso ensembles: the wind quintet Windscape, the Trio Valtorna, with violinist Ida Kavafian and pianist Gilles Vonsattel, and Trio 101-New York, with trumpeter Joe Burgstaller and trombonist Haim Avitsur. Jolley was also a founding member, now emeritus, of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, with whom he toured widely and made over two dozen recordings for the Deutsche Grammophon label.
Compared to Taneyev's massive work, Cherubini's sonata is a quaint piece, barely seven minutes long. But don't let that fool you - it is one of the most technically demanding of the entire horn repertoire. The second and more frequently played of the two sonatas Cherubini dedicated to hornist Frédéric Duvernoy, it is a one-movement piece in two sections.
First comes a Largo that begins with a long, very low horn note with accompaniment that suggests optimism, yet soon becomes melancholy. The horn enters again with an operatic recitative that stretches into a lively melody, despite its slow tempo. This leads into a bouncy Allegro moderato that requires the soloist to pop out short notes almost continually.
In addition to the lip trills, the work has several cadenza-like passages that require excellent flexibility and attention to phrasing. In addition, the light, classical style required is often difficult to achieve. The brevity of the piece is deceptive - this is an extremely taxing work that requires both refined strength and control.
Lenape Chamber Ensemble, 8 p.m. July 27, Delaware Valley University, Life Sciences Building, 700 E. Butler Ave, Doylestown. Tickets: $18; $15, seniors and students. 610-294-9361, www.lenapechamberensemble.org
Allentown Band to feature Broadway favorites
On Saturday, July 27 the Allentown Band, under the baton of Ronald Demkee, goes to Broadway and beyond in a program showcasing the most iconic music from Broadway shows and the opera world. Also on the bill are American Songbook classics by Gershwin, Foster, and many more.
Featured vocalists are mezzo-soprano Lauren Curnow and lyric tenor Eric Fennell, two singers with local roots who have garnered great acclaim in the international music world.
Curnow, an Easton native and voice faculty member of the Muhlenberg College music department, is well-known to local audiences.
In addition to her frequent appearances with the Pennsylvania Sinfonia, Muhlenberg Theater productions, and Berks Opera, she's sung eight mainstage roles with the Lyric Opera of Chicago and performed with the Santa Fe Opera, the Opera Theater of St. Louis and the Wolftrap Opera.
Allentown native Eric Fennell now resides in Berlin, Germany. Fennell's numerous operatic highlights include Rodolfo in "La Bohème" with the New York City Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, Opera Saratoga, and National Theater Mannheim; the Duke of Mantua in "Rigoletto" for Deutsche Oper Berlin and the Prague National Theater; and Alfredo in "La Traviata" with the New York City Opera and The Slovak National Theater.
Also a distinguished concert performer, Fennell has sung tenor solo roles in Beethoven's 9th Symphony, Verdi's 'Requiem," and Handel's "Messiah" with orchestras as diverse as the Allentown Symphony, the Cairo Symphony, and the Buffalo Philharmonic, the Latvian National Symphony, and with the National Chorale at Avery Fisher Hall.
Music includes Bernstein favorites such as the Symphonic Dances from "West Side Story" and "Maria," sung by Fennell, a Streisand medley sung by Curnow, and what is certain to bring down the house, "Climb Ev'ry Mountain from" "Sound of Music," sung by both.
Also featured are opera standards that include the Habanera and Flower Song from "Carmen," "Nessun Dorma" from "Turandot," and lots of Gershwin, Cole Porter, and much more.
Allentown Band, 7:30 p.m. Saturday, July 27, Miller Symphony Hall, 23 N. 6th St., Allentown. Tickets: $20 - $35. 610-432-7961, www.millersymphonyhall.org
Voice recital at St. John's Church in Allentown
Bass-baritone Anthony Sharp will present a vocal recital Saturday, July 27 at St. John's Lutheran Church in Allentown. On the program are excerpts from major works by Handel and Bach, Schubert lieder, and more. Accompanying Sharp is Philadelphia-based pianist Daniel Espie.
An Allentown native, Sharp was frequently heard as a soloist when an undergrad at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance. Since graduating, he has joined the rosters of the Philadelphia Symphonic Choir and the Opera Philadelphia Chorus. Sharp will make his debut with the Pennsylvania Sinfonia Orchestra at its season opening concert Sept. 28, singing Bach's "Ich habe genug." Sharp sings in the Chancel Choir and serves as Pastoral Assistant at First Presbyterian Church in Haddonfield, NJ.
Featured works on the program include "Thus Saith the Lord/But Who May Abide" from Handel's "Messiah," "Am Abend da es kühle war/Mache dich mein Herze rein" from J.S. Bach's "St. Matthew Passion," and "And God Said/Strait Opening/Now Heaven in Fullest Glory Shown" from Handels' "The Creation." The program also features "Ständchen," and "Der Atlas" from Schubert's D 957 lieder and works by Fauré, Richard Strauss, and Tosti.
Anthony Sharp vocal recital, 7 p.m. Saturday, July 27, St. John's Lutheran Church, 37 S. 5th St., Allentown. Admission: Free-will offering. Parking deck at 6th and Walnut. 610-435-1641.

Texto completo: Three months after Nipsey Hussle was gunned down in front of his Marathon Clothing Store in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles comes word that at the time of his death, the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating him for his gang ties.
The New York Times released a report on Monday stating that the LAPD are still investigating Nipsey's connection to gang members.
The strip mall where his clothing store is located is said to be of particular interest to authorities as they try to determine whether it was or still is the center for gang activity.
Since his death, police continue to examine Nipsey's associates and business investments, "including his desire to build an apartment complex," per Hot New Hip Hop.
According to The New York Times report, the rapper's murder supported investigators' concerns that such a violent act could take place on the property.
A spokesperson for the LAPD told the publication that police are negotiating with Nipsey's associates on the property "to mitigate some of those crime issues."
City officials reportedly wanted the owners of the strip mall to evict Nipsey, instead, they sold the property to the rapper and a group of investors.
Nipsey Hussle was fatally shot on March 31. Alleged gang member Eric Holder, 29, was arrested and charged with his murder.

Is there a clinical name for this disorder?

Autor: Frary, John.

Texto completo: This morning’s e-mail included this message from Paco Fabian: “The corporate media would love nothing more than for us to forget that Bernie’s policy vision is being copied by almost every other candidate in the race. Ideally, they want us to vote for Joe Biden, a man who refuses to apologize for working with segregationists and just this week publicly lied about what Medicare for All means.”
“Our movement is a threat to the establishment. Unlike the candidates performing uninspired cover versions of Bernie’s 2016 campaign platform, we are doing the actual grassroots organizing work to advance a progressive agenda and transform our country.”
Paco Fabian speaks for “Our Revolution,” a PAC that grew out of Senator Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run for the presidency. His message was a fund-raising appeal. It included the standard drivel about how Trump and the Republicans are motivated by hate and racism, but its primary target is Joe Biden, the tool of corporate interests.
It did not call Good Ol’ Joe a racist, but reminds us that he worked with racists.
We are already deep in the Democratic Party primary season, and have been getting deeper since the year began. People who support the Our Revolution PAC and “Justice Democrats” are unimpressed by the argument that Biden has the best chance of defeating the Trump Tower Gargoyle. They come from the Democratic Party’s Enraged wing. The Enraged aren’t interested in the most electable party nominee. They are committed to the most revolutionary candidate. They hated Hillary as a servant of the corporations and see Biden as her successor.
Reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, all of whom displaced “mainstream” Democrats with Justice Democrat support, have provoked Nancy Pelosi into dismissing them as insignificant pests, with legions of face-book buddies but no support in Washington. They struck back, with broad hints that Nancy has racist inclinations.

They hate Nancy Pelosi more than Donald Trump. Nancy doesn’t want a revolution. She just wants the government to grow, a Democratic majority in the House under the gavel of a woman named Nancy, and a friendly occupant of the Oval Office. She fears that millions of voters would be alienated by revolutionary hot air.
Tom Friedman, the New York Times’s designated Admiral of the Mainstream recently wrote an column expressing shock at the folly of the radical noises coming Democratic presidential candidates. It’s a shock, as he makes clear, because he had planned to vote Democrat.
With all these promising signs of Democratic fracturing, President Trump ignores Napoleon’s axiom, when your enemy is in the act of destroying himself, don’t interfere. He launches a twitter-storm attacking the Justice Democratic ladies. Result: the story is now about his “racist” tweets and the Pelosians unite with the Enraged in concentrating their fire on Trump.
The simplest explanation for this intervention is stupidity. More complicated explanations might involve a narcissistic urge for attention, a kind of addiction to twitterbabble, or a subtle brilliant strategy. The truly committed Trumpophiles favor brilliance. I’m not one of them.

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13 .
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estas jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban, señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

'Operation Border Resolve' ICE raids, touted by President Donald Trump, net 35 arrests, officials say

Texto completo: An immigration enforcement operation that President Donald Trump called an effort to deport "millions" of immigrants from the USA resulted in 35 arrests, officials said Tuesday.
The action, dubbed "Operation Border Resolve" by the Trump administration, was touted as a significant show of force against an influx of Central American families crossing the border. The operation targeted 2,100 of the roughly 1 million people illegally in the USA with final deportation orders.
Of those arrested, 18 were members of families, and 17 were collateral apprehensions of people in the country illegally who were encountered by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. None of those arrests resulted in family separations, agency officials said.
The raids were condemned by Democrats and lauded by Republicans. Career ICE agents described them as a routine procedure, saying they expected to net an average of 10% to 20% of their targets.
'Harmful, traumatic and chaotic': House report: Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' immigration policy
"We are focused on criminals as much as we can before we do anything else," Trump said before the raids.
ICE conducted a separate nationwide enforcement operation targeting undocumented immigrants who had criminal convictions or charges. That operation netted 899 arrests from May 13 to July 11, according to agency officials.
The agency issued 3,282 notices of inspection to businesses in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, telling business owners that their hiring records would be audited to see whether they employ undocumented immigrants.
This process, sometimes called "silent raids," is intended to "reduce economic opportunities" for undocumented immigrants, according to acting ICE Director Matthew Albence.
“We cannot have individuals who come into the country illegally and then go find work illegally," Albence said in an interview with The New York Times.
Albence said the apprehension efforts would be "ongoing," claiming that increased enforcement could reduce illegal immigration.
'Sorry, can’t let them into our country': Donald Trump defends migrant detention centers, says nothing about ICE raids
“Part of the way you stop people from coming is having a consequence to the illegal activity when you do come,” he said.
The initial operation, scheduled for late June, targeted families and centered on those ordered to be deported by an immigration judge in 10 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Miami and New York City.
That wave of raids was postponed after media outlets reported when and where they would take place. Trump announced the delay after a phone call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , who urged him to do so.
The second effort started July 14, again receiving media attention noting when and where the raids would take place. Trump also called attention to the raids on Twitter, noting the date himself.
In addition to weather challenges – operations were suspended in New Orleans because of a tropical storm – Albence said publicity inhibited actions that rely on secrecy and surprise. The success of previous efforts can partly be attributed to the lack of "fanfare and media attention," Albence said.
Advocates said many immigrants simply stayed home. Immigrant-heavy churches in areas where the raids where scheduled had noticeably lower attendance, and businesses in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in Chicago, Atlanta and Miami reported very light traffic.
Although the raids resulted in a low number of arrests – less than 2% of the population targeted – the Trump administration has not slowed its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.
Monday, the administration promised to expand the Department of Homeland Security's ability to deport immigrants through "expedited removal" if they can't prove they have been in the country continuously during the past two years.
A week ago, the administration announced it would restrict asylum requests for Central American migrants, requiring them to make asylum claims in other countries first. Lawsuits against the rule are pending.

Chef's tastes: Simple, fine dining

Texto completo: Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is one of the most revered chefs in the world.
The Michelin-starred chef has fed Oprah, George Clooney and the Dalai Lama. His eponymous fine-dining restaurant in New York received four stars from The New York Times.
Born and trained in France, Vongerichten owns and operates 39 restaurants worldwide and has shared his work on programs like the "Today Show," "Good Morning America" and "Top Chef."
We caught up with the acclaimed chef as he prepped his latest restaurant Jean-Georges Philadelphia, which opens at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia in August. Vongerichten dished on food trends and let us know what's fresh and what's past their expiration date.
Questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Question: What's your favorite trend happening in food today?
Jean-Georges Vongerichten: When I came to New York in 1986, people were eating Chinese food on Sunday nights. I feel today, people eat Asian food two or three times a week because they're looking for new sensation, new flavors. palates have changed nowadays. They have more tolerance for spice, for acidity, for more flavor on the food.
Q: Are there any food trends you don't like?
Vongerichten: Molecular gastronomy. What I love is the last couple years, we went back to more basics, like simple food. I'm not too crazy about sous vide as well, because I feel like, if you live in a city like Philadelphia or New York, you don't need to put things in a bag or cook it in a bag. I like fire. I like live cooking. I think we're going back to that, to a more simple, more direct way of cooking. I feel we are going back in touch to more simple life and more simple things. Nobody needs chemicals in their food. I feel the molecular gastronomy was a little out of whack.
Q: What food will never go out of style?
Vongerichten: People are always going to eat Italian food. They're always going to have sushi. Is it creative sushi? Is it traditional sushi? I mean, it's still sushi. Same thing with Italian. But you know what's never going to go out of style? Good food. Delicious food. Some type of people are looking for weird combination, but, in the end, we're all going back to delicious.
Q: Your career in food and dining has taken you all over the world. Are there any food trends from other countries you wish were more popular in America?
Vongerichten: When I go to a new city I've never been to … I drop my luggage in the hotel. I go straight to the market, and I see how people eat. I feel like all the markets in Asia are run by people cooking at the market. If you look at the food trucks and everything else, the only street food we had in New York for many years was hot dogs. Now we have all kinds I'm a big fan of street food.
Q: What's an older trend that isn't in style anymore but you think should be brought back?
Vongerichten: I feel like in the old days, everything was on a platter. Everything was cooked in a pot, and put the pot in the middle of a table, and people served themselves. I feel we're going back to that a little bit. I don't know if it's the "Game of Thrones" cooking, where you put the leg of lamb in the middle of the table and people slice their own. People want to see the real food. I feel like we're going back to bigger pieces, less plating, less touching the food.
Q: How important would you say presentation is to the overall dining experience?
Vongerichten: Oh, it's very important. I mean, everything has to be Instagramable. Is it a whole chicken on fire or is it something beautifully presented with edible flowers? I think today, visual is very important, as you know. Is it simple? Is it complicated? But the visual I think today where everyone is posting food, everybody is taking pictures of views of design, I think it's a way of communication today. Sometimes if I go to a restaurant, I go to Instagram to see what the food looks like before I actually make a reservation.
Q: How do you think people will be eating in the future?
I believe that the future of food is really plant-based. I was saying that to all my chefs. We're still gonna eat steaks and fish and a lot of things, but I think, as a daily diet, we're probably gonna eat more plants and grains.
Q: Who are some celebrities or famous people you've served in your restaurants?

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show. That song, in which its protagonist is in the club watch an ex-lover dance with another, has been taken over by her fans in ways she says she never imagined.
“I really didn’t know or understand what ‘Dancing On My Own’ has meant to my fans,” she says. “But I understand from people telling me. So whether it’s me watching, like, people dance in a subway or Instagram about a night out listening to my music, those are things I see, and then, of course, I feel the response from the audience when I’m touring.”
On the “Body Talk” tour there were moments where the audience sang so loudly she could hardly hear herself, so sometimes Robyn and the band simply stopped playing for a few bars. For this tour, they decided to make it a feature of the song.
“It’s like they’re singing the song back to us, which is also a way of acknowledging them, and what they have done with the song in their lives,” she says. “(It’s) what happens when I’m not there. What happens when they’re in a karaoke bar or with friends, or they’re listening to the song at home.
“That’s something that I never get to see,” Robyn says. “It’s like a moment to share that. I made the song, but they gave it the meaning or whatever it has in their life.”

Texto completo: An immigration enforcement operation that President Donald Trump called an effort to deport "millions" of immigrants from the United States resulted in only 35 arrests, officials said Tuesday.
The enforcement actions, dubbed "Operation Border Resolve" by the Trump administration, were touted as a significant show of force against a recent influx of Central American families crossing the border. The operation targeted 2,100 of the roughly 1 million people in the U. S. with final deportation orders.
Of those arrested, 18 were members of families and 17 were collateral apprehensions of people in the country illegally who were encountered by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. None of those arrests resulted in family separations, agency officials said.
The raids were condemned by Democrats and lauded by Republicans. But, career ICE agents described them as a routine procedure, saying that they expected to net an average of 10 to 20% of their targets.
'Harmful, traumatic and chaotic': House report: Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' immigration policy
"We are focused on criminals as much as we can before we do anything else," Trump said ahead of the raids.
ICE also conducted a separate nationwide enforcement operation targeting undocumented immigrants who had criminal convictions or charges. That operation netted 899 arrests between May 13 and July 11, according to agency officials.
The agency also issued 3,282 notices of inspection to businesses in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, telling business owners that their hiring records would be audited to see if they are employing undocumented immigrants.
This process, sometimes called "silent raids," are intended to "reduce economic opportunities" for immigrants, according to acting ICE director Matthew Albence.
“We cannot have individuals who come into the country illegally and then go find work illegally," Albence said in an interview with The New York Times.
Albence said that the apprehension efforts would be "ongoing," claiming that increased enforcement could reduce illegal immigration.
'Sorry, can’t let them into our Country': Donald Trump defends migrant detention centers, says nothing about ICE raids
“Part of the way you stop people from coming is having a consequence to the illegal activity when you do come,” he said.
The initial operation, scheduled for late June, targeted families and centered on those who had been ordered to be deported by an immigration judge in 10 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City.
That wave of raids, however, was postponed after media outlets reported when and where they would take place, though Trump announced the delay following a phone call with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who urged him to do so.
The second effort started July 14, again receiving media attention noting when and where the raids would take place. Trump also called attention to the raids on Twitter, noting the date himself.
Although the raids were expected to begin early that Sunday, with immigration reform advocates bracing their communities for the impending action, local elected officials and advocacy groups reported seeing little to no activity over the weekend.
Albence later conceded that the number of arrests was lower compared to similar operations. A 2017 operation, also part of Operation Border Resolve, resulted in 650 apprehensions over four days, according to ICE. Among those arrested were 73 family members and 120 people who entered the country as children.
In addition to weather challenges — operations were suspended in New Orleans because of the tropical storm there — Albence said publicity inhibited an operation that relies on secrecy and surprise. The success of previous operations can partly be drawn back to the lack of "fanfare and media attention" around them, Albence said.
Advocates also said that many immigrants simply stayed home. Immigrant-heavy churches in areas where the raids where scheduled to take place had noticeably lower attendance, and businesses in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods in Chicago, Atlanta and Miami reported very light traffic.
Although the raids resulted in a low number of arrests — less than 2% of the population targeted — the Trump administration has not slowed its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.
On Monday, the administration promised to expand the Department of Homeland Security's ability to deport immigrants through "expedited removal" if they can't prove they have been in the country continuously during the last two years.
That news came just one week after the administration announced it would all but end asylum requests for Central American migrants, requiring them to make asylum claims in other countries first. Lawsuits against the matter are pending.

Texto completo: Los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) detuvieron solamente a 35 inmigrantes durante las grandes redadas anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump que tenían como objetivo al menos a 2,000 personas.
Este reporte corresponde únicamente a una semana de operaciones y no se mezcla con datos de otros operativos, ya que el director de la agencia, Matthew Albence , dijo a The New York Times, que en los últimos meses ha habido cientos de capturas.
El presidente Trump anunció la operación antes de que realmente sucediera, lo que podría haber dado a las personas el tiempo suficiente para abandonar sus hogares para evadir el arresto, y les dio a los defensores tiempo para informar a las familias sobre sus derechos.
La redada tenía como objetivo exacto a 2,105 personas que han recibido órdenes finales de deportación, una lista supuestamente liberada en febrero.
“No conozco a ninguna otra población donde la gente diga cómo evitar el arresto como resultado de una actividad ilegal” , lamentó el funcionario. “Ciertamente nos hace más difícil realizar estas órdenes emitidas”.
El funcionario indicó que ICE no informa cuando realiza sus operativos, tal como se confirmó al solicitar detalles de las redadas en 10 ciudades, las cuales derivaron en acciones aisladas o “miniredadas” .
Ante las alertas, la agencia ha cambiado de estrategia, indicaron activistas, quienes sugieren a los inmigrantes en peligro de deportación mantenerse en alerta y seguir los mismos consejos ante una eventual redada .
1. Evitar huir.
2. NUNCA mostrar una identificación falsa.
3. Respete a los oficiales migratorios.
4. NUNCA renuncie a su derecho de defensa y realizar una llamada telefónica.
5. NUNCA firme documentos sin asesoría legal.

Texto completo: Joe Biden, whose long record on criminal justice matters has cast a shadow over the early months of his presidential campaign, has unveiled a comprehensive plan aimed at combating mass incarceration and reducing “racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system."
In his more than three decades as a senator, Biden was a tough-on-crime Democrat who could be impatient with concerns about the societal dynamics that contribute to crime, and he championed the 1994 crime bill that many experts now associate with mass incarceration.
That history has presented a challenge for Biden as he mounts his third bid for the presidency, with many progressives questioning his commitment to reforming a criminal justice system that disproportionately ensnares people of color.
But Tuesday, Biden, the former vice president, introduced a wide-ranging criminal justice reform proposal that his campaign said sought to reduce incarceration, and the toll it takes on poor communities and communities of color, at every stage, from addressing “underlying factors" that start as early as childhood to calling for the elimination of the death penalty.
Biden's proposal includes plans to address societal dynamics that affect children and are linked with crime and future incarceration, along with a heavy emphasis on reforming the juvenile justice system.
In proposals that would aim to reverse the legacies of the 1994 crime bill, Biden called for eliminating discrepancies in sentencing between powder and crack cocaine and for the elimination of mandatory minimum sentencing. He also called for an end to cash bail.
And the plan supports eliminating the death penalty through legislation at the federal level and incentives at the state level, a position that is a sharp departure from the position that Biden vocally embraced in the 1990s and throughout his Senate career.

Coal magnate to host Trump fund-raiser; miners seek aid
Coal magnate Robert Murray will host a fund-raiser for President Trump Wednesday, even as dozens of disabled miners pressure Congress to restore a higher tax on the fossil fuel that pays for treatment of black lung disease.
Murray, a longtime Trump benefactor and the chief executive of Murray Energy Corp., is hosting the event at the WesBanco Arena in Wheeling, W. Va. A spokesperson for the company confirmed event details but did not answer questions about who else was attending and the expected cash haul.
The miners from Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia were in Washington Tuesday trying to persuade lawmakers to revive a tax of up to $1.10 per ton of coal that helps pay for medical care of black lung disease, amid a resurgence in the respiratory ailment caused by inhaling coal dust.
Congress last year let that tax rate lapse and revert to 1977 levels of up to 50 cents per ton, after industry leaders argued the expense could further disadvantage coal.

Sanders campaign workers agree on pay raise plan
WASHINGTON — Unionized organizers for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders approved a pay raise proposal from management late Monday, following a tense internal standoff in which employees had argued they were not being paid the wages Sanders advocates in his rhetoric.
Sanders confirmed the deal in an interview Tuesday on CNN, saying he was "happy to tell you . . . that offer was just accepted." Details of the plan were not immediately known.
The arrangement came after organizers battled Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir for higher salaries. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that campaign employees had argued to Shakir that the compensation levels did not meet the principles Sanders advocates, invoking his campaign speeches as they made their case.
It was unclear whether the changes would satisfy most of the field organizers for the long run, or whether future tensions would arise with management. It also was unclear what if any role Sanders played in the process and when he first learned about the dispute.

Trump says he has 'right to do whatever I want'
Donald Trump believes being president means he has the right to do what whatever he wants. That's the message he delivered — not for the first time — on Tuesday while addressing a crowd of teenagers and young adults at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit in Washington.
"Then, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president," he said.
Trump appears to be discussing Article II of the Constitution, which at no point indicates that the president has the power to what he or she chooses.
Speaking to ABC in June about allegations that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller, the president said, "Article II allows me to do whatever I want."

Texto completo: More than 2,000 migrants who were in the United States illegally were targeted in widely publicized raids that unfolded across the country last week. But figures the government provided to The New York Times on Monday show that just 35 people were detained in the operation.
President Trump had touted the raids -- called Operation Border Resolve -- as a show of force amid an influx of Central American parents and children across the southern border. After postponing the raids in June, Mr. Trump said ahead of time that they would take place last week.
Two current Department of Homeland Security officials and one former department official also confirmed to The Times that an enforcement operation would take place around mid-July.
But the publicity may have prompted many of those who had been targeted -- 2,105 people in more than a dozen cities who had received final deportation orders but had not reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers -- to temporarily leave their homes, or to move altogether to evade arrest.
Advance notice of the large-scale operation also gave immigrant advocates time to counsel families about their rights, which include not opening the door or answering questions. On social media, community groups shared detailed information about sightings of ICE agents.
In an interview Monday, Matthew Albence, the acting director of ICE, which is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting unauthorized immigrants who are already in the United States, acknowledged that the number of apprehensions was low.
"I don't know of any other population where people are telling them how to avoid arrest as a result of illegal activity," he said. "It certainly makes it harder for us to effectuate these orders issued."
"You didn't hear ICE talking about it before the operation was taking place," he added.
The arrests of the nearly three dozen migrants -- 17 of whom were members of families that crossed the border together and 18 of whom were so-called collateral apprehensions of undocumented people -- were among more than 900 that the immigration authorities have made since mid-May, Mr. Albence said.
From May 13 through July 11, ICE arrested 899 adults who had final deportation orders, in an undertaking called Operation Cross Check. The majority had criminal convictions, Mr. Albence said.
A backlog of nearly one million immigration cases means that it can take years for a case to wind its way through the courts. Those who were targeted in last week's raids had been placed on an accelerated docket, with a goal of resolving their cases within a year. The majority had been ordered removed from the country by an immigration judge.
"What we found is that the vast majority did not even show up for their first hearing," Mr. Albence said. "Above and beyond, we sent them letters giving them the opportunity to turn themselves in and arrange for an orderly removal process," including time to organize their affairs and schedule flights on commercial carriers.
As part of a multipronged approach to rein in illegal immigration, Mr. Albence said that the government had also been cracking down on companies suspected of hiring undocumented immigrants. He said 3,282 businesses across the country were told last week to submit payroll documents for review.
"Part of our goal is to reduce economic opportunities," Mr. Albence said. "We cannot have individuals who come into the country illegally and then go find work illegally."
The audits of companies and payroll forms, often called "silent raids," hit restaurants, food processing, high-tech manufacturing, agriculture and other industries that employ thousands of workers, according to lawyers representing some of the companies. Employers typically lose a substantial number of workers as a result of the audits, which can also lead to fines and criminal charges against the businesses.
The Trump administration has significantly increased company inspections, often called I-9 audits for the form that workers are required to fill out affirming that they are authorized to work in the United States. There were 5,981 such audits in fiscal 2018 compared to 1,360 the previous year.
"The Trump administration has been more aggressive than any administration with I-9 investigations," said Kimberley Robidoux, a business immigration lawyer in San Diego who specializes in compliance and who has several clients who are affected.
Still, as it grapples with a record number of migrant families at the southern border, the Trump administration has so far deported fewer people, on average each year, than the Obama administration.
In fiscal year 2018, the Trump administration deported 256,086 immigrants, an increase of 13 percent over the previous year. In contrast, President Barack Obama removed 409,849 people in 2012, an all-time high, and 235,413 in fiscal year 2015.
In the first two quarters of the 2019 fiscal year, the Trump administration deported 130,432 people, up from 123,253 during the same period the previous year.
Mr. Obama directed immigration authorities to target for arrest and removal convicted criminals, migrants who had crossed the border recently and those who had illegally entered the country multiple times. Mr. Trump has said that anyone agents encounter who is living in the country illegally is fair game for detention and removal.
Indeed, on Monday the Trump administration said that it would accelerate the deportation of undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the United States for more than two years, enabling federal agents to arrest and deport people without a hearing before a judge.
The expansion of a so-called expedited removals program, which is expected to be challenged in court, could result in people being deported without a court hearing and could affect their ability to seek asylum in the United States.
Just last week, the administration announced it would deny protections to immigrants who failed to apply for asylum in at least one country they passed through on their way north, in its latest attempt to deter Central Americans from heading to the United States. That policy was challenged in court by a coalition of immigrant advocates one day after it was announced.
The Border Patrol has arrested 363,300 migrant family members from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala at the southern border so far in fiscal year 2019. Many of them are seeking asylum, having fled violence in their home countries.
Because children cannot be detained for more than 20 days under established standards, the Border Patrol has been releasing families, who usually turn themselves in to authorities after crossing the border, to await their immigration court dates.
"This highlights the challenges when we are unable to detain individuals at the border and are forced to release them into the country," Mr. Albence said.
Last week, Mr. Trump deemed the operation targeting families that began around July 14 as "very successful."
The government's plans changed at the last minute because of news reports that had tipped off immigrants about what to expect, according to several current and former Department of Homeland Security officials. Instead of a large sweep, the authorities opted for a limited and more diffuse scale of apprehensions.
The families who were rounded up have been placed in family detention centers, where it is difficult for them to gain access to legal help. But immigration lawyers said that they could still take steps to halt their immediate deportation, for example by filing an appeal or a motion to reopen their cases. Some of the families, they said, might not have been aware they missed a court hearing if they did not receive a notice of if they had moved.

Texto completo: It's easy to lose track of all the appalling stories recently told, whether in podcast or documentary form, of miscarriages of criminal justice - particularly where a person of color is wrongly arrested, publicly excoriated and even wrongly convicted (if not outright killed) in a predominantly white community. The details of one outrage bleed into the next, and then to the next, until documentary-related despair sets in. What can one ever really do about it, except watch and hopefully learn?
Filmmaker Liz Garbus's "Who Killed Garrett Phillips?" (airing in two parts Tuesday and Wednesday on HBO) meticulously and even masterfully brings its viewers to this very place of angry exasperation, laying out the narrative details of a botched murder investigation that some of us might have been vaguely aware of, if at all.
I'll admit to being something of a Garbus fanboy - she's great at what she does, on subjects as varied as Nina Simone, Gloria Vanderbilt or the inner workings of the New York Times's Washington bureau. One of her finest projects for HBO, "There's Something Wrong With Aunt Diane," which was about a horrifying 2009 drunken driving crash, continues to haunt anyone who has seen it. (A friend told me that if in the afterlife we get the answers to everything we wanted to know, one of her first questions is going to be about Aunt Diane.)
"Who Killed Garrett Phillips?" may seem to be a far more banal story at first, especially in our never-ending supply of true-crime tales on offer these days. It's about the unsolved October 2011 murder of a 12-year-old boy, Garrett Phillips, who was strangled by an intruder while he was home alone in the Potsdam, N.Y., apartment he shared with his mother and brother.
Laying out a timeline of Garrett's death and the earliest decisions by local and state police to focus on a single suspect rather than pursue other potential leads, the film slowly builds its story around the incompetent and often racially biased work by the officers who professed to care so deeply about the crime. They immediately go after Nick Hillary, a Jamaican-born soccer coach at Clarkson University, who, in addition to being one of the few black men who live in Potsdam, had also dated Garrett's mother, Tandy Cyrus.
After failing to intimidate Hillary into confessing (Garbus makes expert use of publicly available footage from inside the police station), the case devolves into a heartbreaking and laborious five-year travesty, in which the town and its prosecutors (as well as Garrett's family members) keep trying to pin the murder on Hillary, with no real evidence.
The film distinguishes itself from similar documentaries with its intimate, inside access to Hillary and the lawyers and others who worked to prove his innocence. Garbus is also evenhanded with officers and prosecutors, probing their recollections and observations - including those of Garrett's mother's other ex-boyfriend, John Jones, a white officer who insinuated himself early into the investigation and rushed to console her and hold her hand during police questioning right after the murder. More amateur storytellers might use this angle to provoke suspicion; Garbus wisely lets it rest there for the viewer to mull.
That allows "Who Killed Garrett Phillips?" to concentrate on its real takeaway: Absent any evidence, a boy is still dead and an innocent man's livelihood was all but ruined by zealous authorities. It takes a certain moral courage these days to make a crime documentary that sticks to the facts rather than detonate a fresh series of theories or otherwise "solve" the crime. In other words, the film leaves the question in its title unanswered, as Garbus gives her sources an opportunity to speak (or not) about the choices they made. Ambiguity is not a flaw here; in fact, it's what makes this story so compelling, so infuriating and so sad.

Texto completo: Meghan McCain is sharing her motivation for opening up about her "horrendous" miscarriage in a New York Times op-ed.
The 34-year-old "View" co-host took to Instagram Saturday to give thanks for the positive reactions to her reveal. In her piece that published Friday, McCain wrote of the excruciating pain of recently losing her pregnancy. "My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone," she wrote. "I loved my baby, and I always will. "
McCain began her Instagram post by sharing a quote from the 2006 film "Rocky Balboa," from the series about the fictitious boxer of the same name portrayed by Sylvester Stallone.
“'It's a very mean and nasty place," her post began, "and I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. ' ~ Rocky Balboa. "

McCain then shared her gratitude for the "many beautiful and kind responses" to her op-ed.
"(Husband Ben Domenech) and I are the luckiest, most incredibly blessed people in the world surrounded by love and support," she captioned a picture of the pair. "My hope is by continuing to share grief and loss, and addressing these taboo subjects head on it will help people who have experienced the same to feel less alone. None of us are alone in this.
"I was petrified to share my story publicly but I never, ever let fear dictate my life choices. I will always take the leap, I will always roll the dice," she continued. "And to this man who loves my wild heart, has never tried to change a single thing about me, and continues to be the greatest source of strength, love and faith a woman could ever ask for ~ I thank God for sending you to me every day, Ben. #rideordie"
'Where are you in this?': Meghan McCain calls out Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner
In the op-ed, McCain credited her faith with reminding her that "life and death are beyond our power. "
"I am not hiding anymore…" she wrote. "Women need to be able to speak about this publicly, without the stigma and the lack of knowledge that pervades the issue. "
She added: "I have love for all the women who, like me, were briefly in the sisterhood of motherhood, hoping, praying and nursing joy within us, until the day the joy was over. You are not alone. "

Texto completo: There are four lessons when it comes to FaceApp. Number one: It's important to understand the privacy implications of it and every other app you use. Number two: Don't believe every rumor you hear about horrible things apps might do. Number three: Don't assume that every app or piece of technology coming out of Russia is necessarily nefarious. And number four: It's fun.
FaceApp is a popular iOS and Android app that lets you see how you're going to look when you get older and remind you how you may have looked when you were younger. You can also apply it to pictures of other people. It's a fun app, but it also has raised both real and imagined privacy concerns.
Let's start with the imagined one.
There were widespread rumors and media reports that the app was sending all of your photos, including screenshots, to its developers in Russia and implications that these images were being turned over to the Russian government. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called for FBI and Federal Trade Commission investigations because of the app's "national security and privacy risks for millions of U.S. citizens." But both The Associated Press and The New York Times quoted security experts who said that the app was not sending your entire photo library to the company's servers but only the photos you selected, which makes sense since the most effective way the company could apply its algorithms to your pictures is if you upload them to their servers.
Still, as part of lesson one, it is important to note that the app's privacy policy does give the developer some rights including the right to send you ads and store your pictures, but this is typical of many apps. So, getting back to lesson number one, do pay attention to privacy policies but know they can sometimes be complex. FaceApp's privacy policy is typically broad and legalistic but not draconian as privacy policies go.
When it comes to lesson number two, don't assume everything bad or good you hear about an app or any other technology is necessarily true. There are a lot of false rumors and urban myths circulating online. A while back, millions of people reposted the false rumor that "Facebook has just released the entry price, $5.99, to keep the subscription of your status to be set to private,' " and there are plenty of other examples. Frankly, I'm disappointed that media outlets and elected officials fell into and spread the moral panic over this app before verifying the rumors.
My policy is to avoid sharing information I see on social media without first making some effort to find out if it's true. You may never be 100% sure of whether something is true or false, but you can make a reasonable effort by searching for information and paying attention to the sources of the information you find. For example, I can't swear with 100% certainty that the security experts quoted by the Times and AP are correct about what they say about FaceApp, but I do know those are credible experts being quoted by credible media outlets.
Lesson number three is less about technology and more about our national obsession with all things Russia. Yes, the Russian government interfered with our election. Yes, there are companies that collaborate closely with the Putin administration. But not everyone in Russia is an agent of the government. I can't say with certainty that the app developer isn't turning over information to the Russian government, but there is no evidence that it is happening. The Washington Post reported that its developer, Wireless Labs, was founded and is run by CEO Yaroslav Goncharov, who worked for Microsoft as a technical lead in Redmond, Washington, for three years starting in 2003 and more recently held executive positions for Russian telecommunications companies SPB Software and Yandex. Again, I don't know if he is or isn't turning over data, but what I do know is that great technology has been coming out of Russia since the Soviet era and, while there is always good reason to be concerned, there is also no reason to panic over every company based in Russia or for that matter China. Concern yes, panic no.
Lesson number four is that FaceApp is fun, but far from perfect. It applies a lot of filters to images, including an age filter that attempts to approximate what you will look like in the future and what you looked like when you were younger. I tried it and was amused by my future self (more wrinkled but not that bad) and disappointed on how inaccurate it was about my past self. There are other filters that let you change hair color, style and add facial hair but these only work on the Pro version that I didn't want to pay for.
Bottom line: Enjoy your phone and your apps, but do vet apps and do know that there are privacy concerns with many apps you probably already use, including some from major companies. There is a lot we don't know about what apps actually do, but if we're careful we can at least reduce our risk.
Finally, there is one more risk associated with FaceApp. It's one more piece of technology that can distort reality so, if you see a picture of someone who looks older than they should, it may be real, but it may also be fake.

Texto completo: The phrase “America, Love It or Leave It” has a pedigree dating back at least to the McCarthy Era. In the ’70s, the phrase was employed again against those protesting America’s involvement in the Vietnam War. The left has its own version, vowing to leave the country if a Republican is elected president. They rarely do.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2656862" src="https://i2.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Cal-Thomas-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C190&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="190" data-recalc-dims="1" />
On Monday, President Trump resurrected the phrase as he again publicly slammed four freshman congresswomen for their criticism of the United States and his policies. He suggested they “go back where you came from,” though they are all American citizens.
Whatever one thinks of the president’s remarks — the predictable “racist” charge was leveled at him because the four are women of color and two are Muslim — the president is setting Democrats up for what could be a major defeat in the 2020 election by forcing them to embrace (probably) these people and their statements, thus causing further fallout within the party, or denounce them (unlikely) and risk electoral harm. It’s a lose-lose for Democrats.
AXIOS, a nonpartisan news and information company, shared the results of a small, exclusive poll taken in May of a “crucial group of swing voters.” Respondents, “1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education” put their approval of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in low double or single digits.
Only last week did Speaker Nancy Pelosi, discussing the congresswomen’s opposition to the emergency border aid bill — a bill the leadership supported — seem to dismiss them in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, “They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.” After the president’s comments Monday, Pelosi felt obligated to defend the four congresswomen, but that may come at a cost.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Caroline, took things a step too far when he called the four “anti-America” communists on “Fox and Friends,” another throwback to the McCarthy Era, which Graham has previously denounced.
Still, this is likely to play well with people who believe too many politicians spend most of their time criticizing America instead of defending it.
The four congresswomen have been critical of the nation they were elected to serve and some have even made anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements.
The left swims in a deep sea of hypocrisy when it uses buzzwords like “diversity” and “racism.” A recent example was in Monday’s Washington Times. The newspaper reported that congressional Democrats are opposing four “people of color” nominated to federal courts by President Trump. If a Democratic president had nominated these people and Republicans opposed them, is there any doubt the “racist” slur would be hurled at them?
Still, Sen. Graham was right when he also said it would be helpful if the president would “aim higher” and speak of their policies, rather than engaging in personal attacks. But their hatred for Israel and anti-America statements ARE their policies. Graham is correct in this sense: President Trump has the issues on his side. He is winning on things most people care about, especially the economy. Yes, he frequently touts successes, but they are often overshadowed by his personal attacks.
Winning an argument is better than winning a fight. Winning the argument proves your policies are correct. Winning a fight proves nothing, except who is able to beat up another person. It does not advance an agenda.
There is no excuse for calling detention centers “concentration camps” and likening the Border Patrol to Nazi prison guards, especially since the four freshmen and other Democrats have the power to fix the migrant crisis, but won’t because it appears they prefer having the issue to batter Republicans.
If this keeps up, House Democrats who defend such outrageous statements are likely to find themselves in the minority again. Many Americans are fed-up with hearing this stuff and are likely to take revenge at the polls.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
A special New York Times project on the story of Edward Dwight Jr., as told by Emily Ludolph in today's paper, almost never happened. It just so happened that last November, Emily was digging through The New York Times's archives for a different assignment when she came across a photograph of a handsome young pilot paired with a headline from 1965 that caught her eye. It was a story about something that almost did happen: "Negro Pilot Finds Bias in Air Force: But Absolves NASA on Being Dropped as Astronaut."

"I know about the moon story, and I had no idea who he is and how he fits into it," Ms. Ludolph said.

"A single photograph can lead you down such an amazing rabbit hole," said Veronica Chambers, the editor of Past Tense, a Times initiative that uses our archives to tell new stories. "And that's, to me, part of the treasure of the archives -- is that there are just so many stories waiting to be discovered."

Mr. Dwight was an Air Force pilot who came close to becoming the first black astronaut to go to the moon. He recounted the difficulties he faced being the only person of color during his aerospace training at the heights of both the Space Race and the civil rights movement.
"An astronaut is such an important character in the American mythos," Ms. Ludolph said.

Mr. Dwight's role in the Space Race intersected with what Ms. Ludolph called "some of the biggest players of American history," like President John F. Kennedy (who personally called Mr. Dwight's parents to congratulate them on their son's acceptance to the space program), Whitney Young and Edward R. Murrow.

So, Ms. Ludolph continued to dig. She found that after leaving the military, Mr. Dwight received a Master of Fine Arts degree and became a successful sculptor specializing in African-American issues. A Google search showed his current location: Denver.

"Ed may have felt that history had forgotten him because he never actually got to go to the moon," Ms. Chambers said.
Ms. Ludolph was quite nervous to make the initial call to Mr. Dwight -- worried, perhaps, that that time in his life might be too painful to recall decades later.


At first, it was slow going. "This man picks up the phone and starts answering in these very monotone, 'Yes,' 'Uh-huh,' 'That's me,"' she recounted.

But then, something switched in him, she said, and he began to open up to her about his life. The initial phone call was over an hour long.

Ms. Ludolph ended up visiting Mr. Dwight's art studio in Colorado multiple times, and the two shared many subsequent phone calls. She described Mr. Dwight as a ball of energy, funny and constantly laughing: "This high-pitched giggle that's really infectious and effervescent."

Upon learning more about Mr. Dwight's life, the Past Tense team asked the questions: Could America have sent the first black astronaut into space? (The Russians beat us, sending the first person of African descent, Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez, to space in 1980.) And how could that have affected race relations in our country?

"The thing that America is doing very explicitly with the space program is showing itself to the world in the best possible way," Brian Gallagher, a fellow editor with Past Tense, said of the era.

"It's literally an advertisement for democracy, right? Except they're advertising the kind of democracy that they want to advertise, which is leaving out a lot of people who are Americans," he said.

Ms. Chambers and Mr. Gallagher wanted to be clear that this section was not created with an advocate's aim: to argue that Mr. Dwight should have gone to the moon. According to the two editors, "should have" is an uninteresting concept. Rather, the story is about heroes, and about how they were crafted in the American imagination at a very particular point in history.

Guion S. Bluford Jr. became the first African-American to make it into space in 1983, two decades after Mr. Dwight was a trainee.

"It's really easy to write the story of a first, because it's struggle, struggle, struggle then ta-da, they did it," Ms. Chambers said.
Ms. Ludolph described Mr. Dwight's story as messy and complicated. "You can't wrap it up in a nice bow, no matter how much you want to," she said.

"To really look at what it takes to get so close and to not get there, to me, feels like a worthy journalism endeavor," Ms. Chambers said. "It's just as important to tell the story of people who don't make it all the way, as it is to wave the flag of the people who do."

Texto completo: It was just a single image: a photo of a black man dressed in a "space helmet" on the cover of the New York Times Magazine. The year was March 1, 1959, three years before Ed Dwight formally became an astronaut candidate. Just the idea of an African-American in the space program was powerful and sparked responses, like the one below:
To The Editor:
The picture of the spaceman on the March 1 cover of your magazine will, in my opinion, contribute greatly toward the sale of democracy. America is people. A spaceman can be black, white, brown, yellow or tan. If he is an American citizen dedicated to the preservation of our national defense, a free world and democracy, he is in business for all of us.
It is so seldom this aspect of the role of the American Negro is portrayed that I am taking the liberty of lauding the Times.
Freedom is everybody's business, and given the chance, American Negroes will share, fight and if necessary, die, as they have, for the goals of free men everywhere.

Texto completo: La campaña del presidente Donald Trump para la reelección 2020 está en pleno apogeo y toca arremeter contra todo lo que suene progresista. Al fin y al cabo, incluso los análisis del prestigioso diario The New York Times -poco sospechoso de ser trumpista- le auguran mejores resultados que en 2016, en parte por el tono beligerante del mandatario hacia sus rivales políticos.
En esta batalla discursiva, la nueva enemiga del candidato a la reelección es la lucha por la reducción de pláticos . El equipo de campaña del presidente sacó una serie de popotes (pajitas, pitillos, bombillas) “100% estadounidenses” para plantar cara a lo que considera una idea “progresista”: los popotes de papel .
Liberal paper straws don’t work.
STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today!https://t.co/nanyEFK938
— Team Trump (@TeamTrump) July 18, 2019
“Las pajitas de papel son solo otro ejemplo de los fallidos excesos regulatorios liberales. Pero no temas, ¡el presidente Trump tiene la solución perfecta!”, escribió el director de la campaña de Trump, Brad Parscale, en un comunicado divulgado este viernes.
El asesor dijo que las de papel son “como las ideas liberales, que no funcionan y se vienen abajo al instante” e invitó a los usuarios a hacerse con ellas “hoy mismo”. Y le hicieron caso. Los “popotes Trump”, un pack de diez unidades a 15 dólares, se agotaron este mismo viernes.
Con esta campaña el mandatario insiste en su negacionismo ante el alarmante cambio climático y se burla del tremendo impacto que estos artículos tienen sobre el medio ambiente .
Las pajitas solo suponen el 4% de los desechos plásticos pero -según el diario El País- su pequeño tamaño dificulta que las instalaciones de reciclaje las puedan atrapar y la mayoría termina en ríos y océanos. Solo en Estados Unidos, estiman los sitios web de los Parques Nacionales del país, cada día se utilizan más de 500 millones de absorbentes. Una situación que recientemente llevó a ciudades como Washington o Seattle a prohibirlos.

Texto completo: It's been almost five years since four BuzzFeed employees filmed an experiment in which they tried on ladies' underwear from Victoria's Secret. From this simple premise, an empire would be born as the onetime strangers would come to be known as the popular comedy troupe the Try Guys, launching a series of video challenges that included attempting UFC Fighting, swimming with sharks and undergoing labor pain simulation.
A year after splitting amicably from BuzzFeed and launching their own company, 2nd Try, the Try Guys just hit 6 million subscribers on YouTube, but they aren't limiting themselves to viral videos. Entering a phase they've dubbed "The Summer of Try," the creators have launched a podcast, released a bestselling book and have embarked on a national live tour of 20 cities.
For the uninitiated, the Try Guys comprise four millennials who work seamlessly as a team but also bring their own skill sets to the proceedings. Keith Habersberger, Ned Fulmer, Zach Kornfeld and Eugene Lee Yang were all producers behind the camera at BuzzFeed when they were thrown together to make the original video with ladies' underwear. None of them had met previously - though Habersberger and Fulmer came from improv backgrounds and estimate they had about 200 mutual Facebook friends.
The casting was mainly out of necessity.
"At some point we had to use each other for videos and I started popping up," says Yang, who originally had no performance aspirations. "I thought it was just something to pay the rent so I could make my indie feature."
The group agrees that if someone had set out to cast an ensemble, things would not have worked out for them. "No one would cast us," Kornfeld says. "And in another world, I don't know if we'd be friends. But we have a shared brain at this point."
Their first collaboration was an instant hit with viewers. "We like to say we came up in the world's largest and fastest focus group," Kornfeld says. "The audience said, 'Hey, this is a thing.' It took on a life of its own."
Because they began as producers, they had studied what connected with audiences; they could even tell what jokes people were going back and rewatching. The audience also became an important part of the feedback.
"We've listened to little things, like they said, 'Oh, Zach is like a little turtle,' " recalls Habersberger, which prompted them to launch a series called "Game Time" where they play various games, all dressed as different animals. "It was an idea they gave us."
While they flourished at BuzzFeed for four years, the choice was made to branch off on their own in June 2018, and now they find themselves leading a company that includes a staff of 14 employees, themselves included. ("With health care and a 401(k) plan!" Kornfeld notes.)
As viewers got to know them organically, personalities emerged and their audience became invested in their lives. Fulmer was the first of the group to get married and have a child, and the others began teasing him over how much he talks about his wife. Habersberger, who at one time was best-known for being the tallest member of the group, became known as a foodie who was open to trying experiences including eating the entire Taco Bell menu. Kornfeld has been open about his health struggles with Ankylosing spondylitis, an autoimmune disease that causes chronic pain, and has found that his openness with his struggle has inspired and empowered viewers.
Yang, who is Asian and recently came out as gay in a powerful performance video, says that audiences first got to know him as someone who doesn't like babies.
"One of the big benefits of having sort of been discovered in an online environment is that people get to know you because of the sheer fact of repetition," Yang says. "What the internet got to know about me first, or very quickly, was that I wasn't just the Asian guy or the gay guy, I was the guy who disliked babies. That was a great learning curve; they could see me as a friend or someone that they knew. I think the beauty of a lot of the stuff we do is, we transcended what people would first say. I think that's where Try Guys really started shining, giving a full breadth of human experience."
For their touring show, "Legends of the Internet," they've boiled the internet down to four facets that they each address: Habersberger is "food," Fulmer is "love," Kornfeld is "fun" and Yang is "gay." The show, which Fulmer calls "a full-length rock-and-roll comedy extravaganza," opened in June in Los Angeles and will tour the U.S. through July before heading to Australia.
In addition to audience interaction and bringing some of their favorite games to the stage, the show is a full-on performance, complete with choreographed musical numbers and pyrotechnics.
"We've found we really enjoy performing live and we have this really great cast dynamic and we found that it extends beyond the screen," Habersberger says. "And when we meet our fans we don't want it to be something simple, we want to be bringing a show and creating entertainment."
In May they launched "The TryPod," a weekly podcast that gives listeners a look behind the scenes of their adventures.
Their book, "The Hidden Power of F*cking Up," was released June 18 and went to No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list under advice, how-to and miscellaneous. A blend of genuine self-help and humor, the book tasked each of them to do something outside their comfort zones.
"We challenged ourselves to do things that were opposite of us," Habersberger says. "I led the health section and went vegan for two months and started exercising."
Fulmer took on fashion. "We each attacked the thing we were worst at," he says.
As for the inevitable question if there's anything they won't try, nothing seems to be off the table.
"We brainstorm and look at trending topics," Fulmer says. "But in general we try to make content that relates to people's passions and identities. So there's never going to be enough ideas."

What is a 'wife guy'?

Texto completo: Mikey Mosher is a self-proclaimed "wife guy."
While less Instagram-famous than the viral versions of partner-obsessed men before him, Mosher floods his follower's timelines with content about his girlfriend – including but not limited to her looking at stained-glass windows or lying with her eyes closed on the beach.
There are several solo photos of her on his Instagram account, often with no caption, and on Twitter, he retweets comments like, "After much deliberation, I have decided to stan, my own girlfriend." For the record, 'stan' refers to being an overzealous fan of a particular person.
Mosher says the wife guy title suits him because "there's this whole movement around being obsessed with your wife and being very outwardly open about loving her on social media," the 25-year-old from Massachusetts said. "I noticed that, and I post about my girlfriend a lot, and I guess that makes me a wife guy."
In June, The New York Times published a story titled, "The Age of the Internet 'Wife Guy,'" where the writer explores the latest social media phenomenon – men being praised, then mocked, for being openly consumed by the lives of their significant others.
Who is 'wife guy'?
The definition of wife guy is somewhat loose.
It's fair to say that he is more than just an ordinary husband, spouse or boyfriend.
He may incessantly post photos of his wife online, he may be accused of over-celebrating his partner's achievements or he may go viral for curating entire music videos dedicated to his affinity for her body.
In some cases, it encompasses the personas of recurring online characters who appear to partly define themselves through exaggerated reactions to being in a union with a female. The Times defined the category of men as existing "at the intersection of relationship status and influencer branding."
According to the Outline, a wife guy is "defined by the fact that they have done something which involves a wife, whether their own or someone else's." And New York magazine says wife guys are the men "who make themselves famous for things their wives did, or qualities their wives have or had."
The subject can be confusing, though, because the internet amplifies some wife guys who are divorced and others who aren't even real.
"Elf Wife Guy" became part of the social conversation after he blocked his wife on Twitter, and "Fake Wife Guy" was a man who posed as his wife on social media until the two were going through a divorce. "Cliff Wife Guy" joined the club over Memorial Day weekend when he posted a video of his wife falling down a cliff. She turned out to be OK, and he told USA TODAY in an email that he "wasn't a fan of the spin the internet took on an actual scary situation involving my family."
Perhaps the resurgence in popularity of Borat Voice "My Wife" has contributed to the spread of "wife guy" humor. Actor-comedian Sacha Baron Cohen's character Borat coined the catchphrase in the 2006 movie "Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan."
"After being a popular reference to the film in the years following its release, it grew into an ironic signifier for a poor sense of humor, referenced in pop culture" and later parodied on Twitter, according to Know Your Meme, a website tracking viral content.
Or maybe the phenomenon was advanced by today's women's movement, with men using their wives to publicly declare that they are feminists and allies. Relationship experts say that the trend also could be attributed to a man's need to be approved and validated from outside sources, among other circumstances.
"If the relationship is in its infancy, it's a natural response to say, 'Look at what I've achieved, I've been able to marry this kind, beautiful and ambitious woman,'" said Patrick Wanis, human behavior and relationship expert. "But when it becomes obsessive or appears to be extreme then the motivation could be one of two things: deep insecurity or the person is trying to tell other people, 'Hey, look I'm taken.'"
'Curvy wife guy'
Robbie Trip is probably the most famous wife guy out there. In fact, he's widely credited as being one of the first.
After posting content about his love for his girlfriend, now wife, for years, the 28-year-old was launched into internet fame when he shared a photo on Instagram about how much he adored his "curvy" wife in 2017.
Two years later, he released a music video titled "Chubby Sexy" that rubbed some people the wrong way, with some accusing him of objectifying women. Since going viral, he told USA TODAY that "a majority of the time" the term wife guy has been used "in a mocking way to denigrate the guy in the relationship – that somehow he would be nothing without his wife or that he is less of a man because he so adores his wife."
Tripp said the song's backlash is outweighed by the support from men and women who understand his central message of female empowerment.
While some people use the term "wife guy" as an insult, Tripp says, "There are worse things to be known as than a guy who loves his wife."

Texto completo: Actor, producer, and director Robert Townsend partnered with Jack Daniel's Gentleman Jack and Codeblack Films Wednesday July 10 for a inspirational talk on Black creativity. The event was part of Gentleman Jack's third annual Real to Reel and hosted by Codeblack writer, Anthony Rose.
The Real to Reel event is a national contest and screening tour that showcases emerging Black filmmakers. Three short films were featured. Local directors Don Amon, Rasheed Stephens, and Xavier Burgin presented their art to a crowd at the Wiltern Theatre.
Before the event, Townsend sat down with the Los Angeles Sentinel Newspaper to discuss his creative philosophies, inspiration, and how he operates creativity as an artist.
Los Angeles Sentinel (LAS): You have such a large body of work including 'The Five Heartbeats,' 'Meteor Man,' and the 'Hollywood Shuffle.' How do you maintain multiple creative inspirations?
Robert Townsend: Well, for me, I've always looked at myself as an artist. I think a real artist paints on any canvas that speaks to them. I've always challenged myself. I can go from satirical comedy like 'The Hollywood Shuffle'to music like "The Five Heartbeats." I like to touch a lot of different canvases.
LAS: That sounds like you're not afraid to take chances.
Townsend: That's right. When I did 'Carmen: A Hip Hopera' with Beyoncé, I've never done anything like that before. It was fun working on that project. Real artist speak to what's inside them and tell the story. It's all about being authentic to your voice.
LAS: Where does all that confidence come from?
Townsend: I pray a lot but I also love what I do. I do get scared at moments. However, if you don't try, you won't know. That's what stops a lot of artists.
It's the fear. They are afraid of taking chances because somebody would judge them.
LAS: That's something I really want to dig into. How do you handle judgment?
Townsend: I'll share this story. When I directed 'Holiday Heart,' Alfre Woodard got nominated for a Golden Globe. The New York Times said it was the greatest television movie of the year. However, the Wall Street Journal said it was the worst. So, you shouldn't worry about criticism. It's all about making sure you are happy.
LAS: What has changed the most for filmmakers during your career?
Townsend: I think technology has been the biggest change. When I started, you had to shoot on 35mm cameras and edit on big plate machines. Right now, everything is affordable. The only thing that stops filmmakers today is fear.
LAS: There are a lot of people who will read this and feel inspired. What advice would you give to your younger self about filmmaking?
Townsend: Run even faster to your destiny and manage your time better. Also, don't let people steer you in the wrong direction.

Judge: Michael Cohen campaign finance probe over

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Federal prosecutors have told a judge in New York they have concluded their investigation into campaign finance crimes committed by President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.
The closure of the case is the strongest suggestion yet that federal prosecutors have decided not to bring criminal charges against anyone besides Cohen in the scheme to use hush-money payments to protect Trump's reputation during the 2016 presidential campaign.
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III made the disclosure in a court filing Wednesday as part of a legal fight over whether to unseal search warrant materials dealing with the investigation.
For months, prosecutors had asked that the documents remain sealed because they were still probing payments Cohen helped orchestrate to two women - porn actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy centerfold Karen McDougal - who claimed they had affairs with Trump.
While Cohen pleaded guilty last August to charges that the payoffs amounted to illegal campaign contributions, others involved remained uncharged, including Trump himself and executives at the Trump Organization and American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer.
Now, though, prosecutors have informed the court in a sealed filing that they've concluded the investigation, clearing the way for the release of documents related to the case.
The judge rejected a request by prosecutors to black out portions of the documents to protect third-party privacy interests, saying the records involved "a matter of national importance.
"Now that the Government's investigation into those violations has concluded, it is time that every American has an opportunity to scrutinize the materials, Pauley wrote.
He ordered the government to put the search warrant records related to searches of Cohen's residence and office in the public record by 11 a.m. Thursday.
Trump has denied any sexual relationship with Daniels and McDougal and said any payments made to them were private in nature and not related to his campaign.
"We are pleased that the investigation surrounding these ridiculous campaign finance allegations is now closed, Trump's lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said Wednesday. "We have maintained from the outset that the President never engaged in any campaign finance violation.
The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment and wouldn't answer questions about whether the completion of the investigation meant that no one else would be charged.
In December, Pauley sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for crimes including the campaign finance violations, lying to Congress and tax evasion.
He began serving the sentence in May, saying at the time it was an injustice that he was going to prison for crimes that benefited Trump.
In previous court filings, federal prosecutors in New York appeared to implicate Trump directly, saying that he directed Cohen to make the hush money payments.
However, the Justice Department has held that sitting presidents cannot be charged in the federal criminal justice system and instead can only be punished for misdeeds by Congress through the impeachment process.
"Case closed? asked Cohen's spokesman, Lanny Davis, in a statement questioning why Cohen was the only member of Trump's company to be prosecuted and imprisoned.
"Especially since prosecutors found that virtually all of Michael's admitted crimes were done at the direction of and for the benefit of Donald Trump. Why? Davis said.
The records to be unsealed include search warrant applications that federal prosecutors made to judges in New York when they sought permission to raid Cohen's home and office. In them, they outlined some of the evidence they had gathered about his alleged crimes.
Some of the documents were released publicly previously, but large sections related to the campaign finance probe were blacked out.
In requesting the records, The Associated Press and eight other media organizations had cited high public interest and a right to access.
Prosecutors had initially opposed the request, saying disclosure "would jeopardize an ongoing investigation and prejudice the privacy rights of uncharged third parties.
News organizations in the legal action to unseal the documents included the AP, The New York Times and the parent companies of ABC and CBS News, CNN, the Daily News, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday and the New York Post.
Pauley said the record should be "unredacted in its entirety except for limited references in a footnote to an uncharged third-party and the names of law enforcement investigators, references to individuals purportedly engaged in business transactions or contemplated business transactions with Cohen relating to his taxi business.

As Iran Tensions Rise, So Does Uncertainty Over Prisoners

Texto completo: A Navy veteran from California seized in Iran a year ago has yet to speak with his mother. A British-Iranian woman held in a Tehran prison since 2016 has been moved to a hospital psychiatric unit, incommunicado with her family. A French-Iranian scholar has been arrested without explanation while visiting Iran, just as France is exerting diplomacy to help save the nuclear agreement.
Each case is different, but all share the backdrop of an escalating confrontation between Iran and the United States, and fury among hard-line Iranian conservatives over what they see as Europe's subservience to America.
The United States has long contended, since the Tehran hostage crisis four decades ago, that the Iranians use foreign prisoners as pawns for political leverage. Rights advocates say the prisoners are plunged into a judicial system that is mysterious and arbitrary.
At least four American citizens are known to be held in Iran, two of them Iranian dual citizens. (Iran does not recognize dual citizenship.) While the number of foreigners incarcerated in Iran is unclear, the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a research and advocacy group in the United States, said it had documented at least 12, including dual citizens.
The group said these cases demonstrate the reach of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has carried out many of the arrests. The group also said the arrests, particularly of Iranians with foreign passports, are meant to send a message of intimidation and reflect "hard-liners' efforts to prevent Iran's engagement with the West."
For their part, Iranian officials have said that more than a dozen Iranians are being held by the United States, often on charges of American sanctions violations that Iran regards as illegal. Just this past week, the Justice Department announced the extradition of an Iranian from Germany on charges of having sought to illicitly export large amounts of carbon fiber from the United States to Iran. The material can be used in uranium enrichment.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif proposed a few months ago that Iran and the United States negotiate a prisoner exchange. Attempts via back channels have been rumored, but officials from both sides have declined to comment.
For relatives of the Americans, the basic lack of information about their cases in Iran's opaque judicial system, coupled with the rising tensions over the nuclear agreement and other issues, has amplified the stress.
"I feel like this has gone on forever -- there's no ending," said Joanne White, the mother of Michael R. White, 47, a Navy veteran and throat-cancer survivor who was arrested last July in the northeast city of Mashhad while visiting an Iranian friend.
The mother, who has been unable to speak with her son because he has no telephone privileges in prison, said she had been struggling to raise money via GoFundMe for an Iranian lawyer to help represent him.
In March, Mr. White, of Imperial City, Calif., was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on charges that included posting private photographs on social media and insulting Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. But he also may face additional charges that include espionage, according to a State Department email to Mrs. White that she shared with The New York Times during a telephone interview this week.
"I feel very concerned. I don't know what they would do to Mike," she said.
An appeal of the conviction is scheduled for Monday in a Mashhad court, his mother said, explaining that she is getting most of her information about Mr. White's case from State Department officials.
But those officials have no firsthand knowledge: They have been relaying updates by telephone and email to Mrs. White from Switzerland's embassy in Tehran, which handles the consular activities of American citizens for the United States. Swiss diplomats have visited her son three times, Mrs. White said, most recently on May 7.
According to the State Department's email to her about the most recent visit, Mr. White shares a cell with 14 inmates and "has access to the courtyard where there are sports and to a library." The email said the Swiss had been prevented from bringing him food and had deposited money in his prison account "so Michael will be able to purchase additional food to prepare."
The other three American citizens known to be held in Iran are Xiyue Wang, 38, a Princeton University graduate student; Siamak Namazi, 46, a business consultant; and his father, Baquer Namazi, 83, a former Unicef diplomat. All were sentenced to 10 years on espionage charges that they have denied.
Another American, Robert Levinson, 71, a former F.B.I. agent, has been missing in Iran for 12 years, and his family has said he is a captive there. Iranian officials have said they have no knowledge of his whereabouts.
In Britain, the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian employee of the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, has attracted attention since she was arrested while visiting Iran three years ago with her toddler daughter. She was accused of sedition.
Iranian officials have dropped hints periodically that she might be freed. But British-Iranian relations have worsened significantly in the past few weeks over Britain's impoundment of an Iranian tanker, which Ayatollah Khamenei called piracy by the "vicious British."
On Wednesday, the family said Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been moved from Evin Prison to a hospital psychiatric unit for reasons that remained unclear.
"Even now it still seems like games of power and control are being played by the Iranian authorities -- even at the point of hospitalization," her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, said in a statement.
The Iran prisoner issue most recently entangled France, just as President Emmanuel Macron was engaged in a diplomatic outreach with Iran to reduce tensions over the fraying 2015 nuclear agreement that was abandoned by the United States last year.
On Monday, France's Foreign Ministry said Fariba Adelkhah, an academic with dual French and Iranian citizenship who is a prominent anthropologist at the Sciences Po university in Paris, had been arrested in Iran and denied contact with French consular officials.
Iran has not explained why she was arrested, despite French demands that the Iranian authorities "shed full light on Mrs. Adelkhah's situation."

Texto completo: What would happen if a crowd of people stormed the gates of Area 51 looking for aliens, and all of them ran really fast with their arms outstretched behind them?
We probably won't find out. But the idea has captured the interest of more than a million people on social media.
The joke has caught the attention of the Air Force, too. A spokeswoman warned that acting on the plan would be dangerous.
On June 27, a Facebook account whose name includes a vulgarity shared an event called "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us." It is scheduled for 3 a.m. on Sept. 20 in Amargosa Valley, Nev.
That's not far from Area 51, a secretive military site at the Nevada Test and Training Range, a unit of the Nellis Air Force Base in southern Nevada.
[Bigfoot isn't taken very seriously these days. But in the ' 70s, the search got help from the F.B.I.]
The Air Force spokeswoman said the military was aware of the Facebook activity and warned that "any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous."
The existence of Area 51 was formally acknowledged by the federal government in 2013, when the C.I.A. released a classified report on spy planes that were tested there beginning in the 1950s.
But U.F.O. enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists have long suspected that the base was devoted to the study -- or even the captivity -- of extraterrestrial life forms.
"We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry," the Facebook event page said. "If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let's see them aliens."
The "Naruto run" is a style of running associated with Naruto Uzumaki, the main character in the Japanese anime series "Naruto." It's a meme. To do the run, you tilt your torso forward, extend your arms out behind you, and sprint goofily.
As of Monday, more than a million people had responded to the post to say they were going to the September event. More than 900,000 others said they were interested.
Most seemed well aware that the post was made in jest. One Facebook user shared a detailed battle plan, involving two Naruto runner battalions running "full speed around the north and south flank" of the base. And a few commenters shared a meme that said, "If we all hit our vapes at the same time, we can use it as cloud cover so they won't see us coming."
Like other fake Facebook events, this one was mostly an invitation for people to create joke memes on Reddit, Twitter, YouTube and elsewhere. In addition to sharing implausible invasion tactics, internet users mused about how the aliens would fare in the real world after being freed from captivity by a horde of vaping heroes.

But as it turns out, some people may be taking the event seriously. The Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, Nev., which is close to Area 51, has gotten an unusually high number of reservations for a certain date.
"Oh, it's insane," Connie West, a co-owner of the inn, said in an interview on Sunday. "My poor bartender today walked past me and said, 'I hate to tell you, but every phone call I've had is about Sept. 20."'
She added that many people had mentioned the Facebook post when they called to reserve the inn's rooms and recreational vehicles, all of which are now booked for that date -- even though the Facebook post invited people to Amargosa Valley, which is hours away from the Little A'Le'Inn by car, and on the opposite side of Area 51.
"They're pretty serious," Ms. West said. "They're coming. People are coming."
In response to questions about the Facebook post, Laura McAndrews, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the Air Force does not discuss specific security measures. She noted that "the Nellis Test and Training Range is an area where the Air Force tests and trains combat aircraft."
This is not the first time military officials have had to respond to concerns about the possibly paranormal.
Earlier this year, the Navy seemed to officially acknowledge reported sightings of strange objects in the sky when it sent out new classified guidance on how service members should report what the military calls unexplained aerial phenomena, or unidentified flying objects.
And in 2017, The New York Times reported on a shadowy program at the Pentagon that has been investigating reports of unidentified flying objects for years.
But rather than infiltrate secret military sites, earthlings in search of evidence of extraterrestrial life may want to keep an eye on scientific explorations like the one taking place on Mars, or planned efforts to explore a moon of Saturn.
Ms. West said Area 51 is well guarded, with signs warning trespassers that they could face consequences, including prison time or deadly force, if they get too close. She said she expected people to try to breach the boundaries of Area 51 in September, though she wished they would not.
"There's going to be a force to reckon with," she said of the authorities guarding the base. "They have enough helicopters and military aircraft at Nellis Air Force Base."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
"They're pretty serious," said Connie West, co-owner of the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, Nev. "They're coming. People are coming." (PHOTOGRAPH BY SIQUI SANCHEZ/GETTY IMAGES)

Texto completo: Start-up unveils technology to connect brains with computers
Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled another high-concept project, one he says puts humans on a path to "symbiosis with artificial intelligence." In other words, allow them to control computers with their minds.
His start-up Neuralink said it has tested its elaborate interface of wires, or "threads" - which connects with a chip embedded in the skull - on rats and wants to begin human trials as soon as next year. The company said the device could eventually be used to treat such neurological disorders as paralysis and blindness.
Musk and the company outlined their plans, which require Food and Drug Administration approval, during a presentation Tuesday at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. He said the trials would be done in partnership with neurosurgeons at Stanford University and other academic institutions. The procedure involves drilling four tiny holes in the skull to insert the threads. Eventually, Musk said, the goal is to implant the device with less-invasive laser surgery.
Musk and other Neuralink officials stressed the technology was in very early stages and that the road to reality will be full of rigorous research and regulatory hurdles
"It's not like suddenly we will have this incredible neural lace and will take over people's brains," Musk told the audience. "It will take a long time."
Tuesday's event, the company's first public presentation since its 2017 debut, was primarily geared toward recruiting top-tier talent for the company, which has about 100 employees. The start-up has raised about $158 million since its inception, with Musk himself contributing $100 million.
Max Hodak, Neuralink's president, said the company knows it will need to collaborate with academic and scientific communities. "We are under no illusion that we can do all the scientific research ourselves," Hodak said.
An advanced, "sewing machine"-esque robot would embed the device's tiny, flexible threads - each a fraction of the width of a human hair and collectively outfitted with thousands of electrodes - deep in the brain without doing major damage to the surrounding tissue. Once in place, the threads would relay information to a chip, which in turn would transmit it to an external Bluetooth-like device worn behind the ear, Musk said.
If successful, the system would mark a significant advancement from the stiff needles used in current technology, which allow for far fewer electrode channels, degrade over time and are disrupted when the brain shifts in the skull.
"Neuralink picked the best of existing lab technology and pushed it forward in a number of important dimensions, and most impressively has an integrated implantable product that goes beyond the current state of the art," tweeted Andrew Hires, an assistant professor of neurobiology at the University of Southern California.
Neuralink released an unpublished research paper outlining the company's progress, but it wasn't peer-reviewed, as is standard.
In Neuralink's first demonstration in front of a reporter, Bloomberg News reported, it showed how the system had been implemented in a lab rat, allowing it to receive information from 1,500 electrodes - 15 times better than current systems employed in humans, according to the New York Times.
In the research paper, Neuralink said it completed 19 surgeries on animals, and robots placed the threads accurately 87 percent of the time. During the question-and-answer portion of the presentation, Musk hinted at successful testing on animals much closer to humans at the University of California, Davis.
"A monkey has been able to control a computer with its brain" using Neuralink's interface, Musk claimed. He did not provide further detail, and the company has not put forth any evidence to this effect.
Musk's vision of "superhuman cognition" borne from humans merging with artificial intelligence rivals his other projects - colonizing Mars, hyperloops, life-size Lego buildings - in ambition, but Neuralink is just one of a handful of start-ups working on brain-computer interface technology. Other companies, such as Kernel, CTRL-Labs and Paradromics, have been puzzling over ways to help human brains commune with machines, but not all are focused on technology implanted inside the brain.
One agency in the Defense Department that specializes in emerging technology for the military is funding a slate of brain-machine interface projects at institutions like Carnegie Mellon University and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
The FDA released regulatory guidelines for brain-computer interfaces in February, with the explicit aim of fueling development of the technology.
"These devices have the potential to benefit people with severe disabilities by increasing their ability to interact with their environment," FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement accompanying the guidelines designed to "help potential developers of these novel devices address this area of unmet medical need and promote innovation while maintaining appropriate patient protections."
Musk also told the audience that he sees Neuralink not only as a medical solution, but also as a means for humans to keep from being "left behind" by the artificial intelligence he believes will eventually overtake humanity.
"With a high bandwidth brain-machine interface, we can go along for the ride," Musk said, "and effectively have the option of merging with AI."

Texto completo: Donald Trump got elected by criticizing America. His campaign slogan told us over and over, in speech after speech, on hat after hat, we were no longer great. His inaugural address referenced poverty, gangs, drugs, rusted-out factories, lousy schools and American carnage.
"For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry," he said. "Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.
"We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own," he continued, "and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.
"We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country," he said, "has disappeared over the horizon."
He evoked such dark and dismal themes repeatedly on the campaign trail and has returned to them as needed while in office.
Which makes Sunday's outburst all the more absurd.
On Sunday, the president wrote a string of tweets aimed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her fellow representatives in the House: Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
"So interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly ...
"... and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how. ...
"... it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"
Pressley, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez were born in the United States. Omar was born in Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in 2000.
The tweets are racist and nativist. As New York Times columnist Charles Blow puts it, "The central framing of this kind of thinking is that this is a white country, founded and built by white men, and destined to be maintained as a white country."
"It sees a country from which black and brown people come as deficient - 'a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world' - because, at its base, it sees black and brown people as deficient," Blow writes.
The tweets are also an insult to our intelligence.
Americans know dissent is woven into our history and protected by our Constitution.
We know our freedom of speech is preserved in the very first of our amendments. We know that very first amendment also preserves our right to peaceably assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
We know presidents, presidential hopefuls, faith leaders, abolitionists, suffragists, soldiers, veterans, civil rights activists, artists, historians, athletes, professors, students, pundits, historians - citizens of every background and political persuasion - have been criticizing this nation, nudging and prodding and striving toward that more perfect union promised in our Constitution's preamble, since our earliest days.
We know that nudging and prodding and striving are what keep us free and just and ever closer to a nation where more and more of its people enjoy that freedom and justice equally.
We know that the people willing to patiently nudge and loudly prod and tirelessly strive - even when we don't agree with every word or policy they profess - are the people we need more of, the people we look to for guidance, the people who see both our potential and our historical hunger to reach it.
So when the president tells our modern-day nudgers, prodders, strivers, "you can't leave fast enough," we know better. History has taught us better. He knows better too. He wouldn't have run on "Make America Great Again," he wouldn't paint such a dismal portrait of America in his inaugural address, he wouldn't so frequently and freely exercise his own right to criticize the government if he didn't recognize that freedom as a fundamental American value.
He just doesn't want that freedom to be accessible to all. He wants the criticism to remain steeped in nostalgia, not change. He doesn't want to hear it from people who don't look like he looks, who represent a shift in the rules about who holds the power, who makes the rules, who signs the laws in this country.
Thankfully, that's not how America works.
As U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell from California tweeted on Sunday to Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Rashida Tlaib: "You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home. You are home."
And we're all better for it.

Texto completo: Even beyond its ambitious plans to send human beings to other worlds, NASA can still inspire.
The space agency sparked imaginations again recently when it announced the next of its unmanned missions to other worlds. This time it will send a car-sized helicopter called Dragonfly to explore the frigid surface and atmosphere of Titan, an intriguing moon that orbits Saturn.
Everything about the adventure is appealing. For a man-made machine to touch down on Titan, to imagine its cameras looking overhead at the belt of rubble that rings Saturn, to be able to probe greater distances than a wheeled rover — this is dazzling stuff.
For scientists, the real draw of Titan is the promising stew of compounds that make up the moon's environment.
"We have all these ingredients necessary for life as we know it, and they're just sitting there doing chemistry experiments on the surface of Titan. That's why we want to send a lander there," Dr. Elizabeth Turtle told The New York Times this spring. She will be the principal investigator for the mission, which will be led by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.
There are reservoirs of liquid methane. There is methane in the atmosphere, too, suggesting that the ingredients for life exist on Titan, or that life once existed there.
Said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine: "Visiting this mysterious ocean world could revolutionize what we know about life in the universe."
As NASA missions go, this one is a relative bargain. It's part of the agency's New Frontiers program, which sends probes to new destinations at a program cost of less than $1 billion each. Previous missions in the program included sending a solar-powered spacecraft to Jupiter, sending a spacecraft and instrument bundle to skim past Pluto and, remarkably, launching the Osiris probe that is expected to return an asteroid sample to Earth after touching down on the rocky Bennu.
Of course, even at $1 billion, this won't be an easy crosstown hop. The plan for Dragonfly is to launch in 2026 and land on Titan in 2034, then prowl around for more than 2½ years before winking out. It will travel about 108 miles around Titan — more than twice the distance covered by the Mars rovers combined. Its communications with Earth will lag by 43 minutes — the time it will take a light signal to cover the vast distance between here and there. Titan is about 10 times farther from the sun than Earth.
While the spacecraft's eight rotors may cause it to resemble drones you can buy on Amazon, this one will be able to cover miles per hop, flying as high as two miles above the surface. On Titan, gravity is lighter and the atmosphere is thicker, and each local day takes 16 Earth days. The good thing, according to Dr. Turtle, is that "it's actually easier to fly on Titan."
Imagine that — "It's actually easier to fly on Titan." It's like a driver saying it's easier to drive on the highway than through town, or a pilot saying it's actually easier to fly a jet than a propeller-driven aircraft.
This is what humans can do, given the time, resources and spirit of adventure. Americans remain a remarkable people in many ways, including in their capacity to explore the frontiers of the imagination.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump appears to have settled on a 2020 reelection strategy — and it looks a lot like his old playbook.
With a Sunday Twitter screed telling four first-term House lawmakers of color to “go back" to their countries, Trump signaled that stirring up racial animus will continue to be a key part of his strategy to reactivate his base heading into what's likely to be a fierce reelection battle.
This worked for him last time, as voters delivered Trump a victory after he called for a wall on the Mexican border, expressed a desire to ban all Muslims from entering the country, and made a name for himself questioning Barack Obama's citizenship. But the political ground has shifted under Trump's feet since then. By fanning these same flames, he now risks activating the voters who delivered House Democrats a victory in the 2018 midterms — the same wave that swept the four women he's targeting into power in the first place.
“The strategy was an epic failure in the midterms and not just because women in Orange County didn't like it — they failed in many working-class white areas too," said Ian Russell, the former political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “There was a flop at the box office and for some reason they greenlit a sequel."
On Tuesday, the House voted 240-187 to condemn Trump's “racist comments," with four Republicans joining all the Democrats.
Trump doesn't appear to be sweating the possibility of electoral damage from his comments, despite widespread criticism of his attack on Representatives Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who call themselves “the Squad." All are US citizens — three of them born here — and yet Trump said they should “go back" to their “broken and crime infested" countries — a suggestion that was widely panned as racist.
“It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me," Trump said Monday, when asked whether he was worried about white nationalists supporting his argument.
Still, many on Trump's staff appeared to struggle to defend his choice of words, with some arguing that Trump only meant the lawmakers should visit other countries and then come back. “What's your ethnicity?" Kellyanne Conway asked of a reporter in the White House driveway Tuesday in one awkward exchange. “My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy."
On Tuesday, Trump indicated that his broadside was all part of a master plan to elevate the four women who are further to the left than many in the party, and to seize upon tensions between them and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ahead of the 2020 election.
“Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party," he tweeted of the four women. “See you in 2020!"
Republican political strategists expressed skepticism that Trump's original tweets were part of any kind of carefully planned strategy. (A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign declined to comment.)
“My guess is he was bored on Sunday morning and wanted to start a fight," said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who worked on Senator Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign.
But they do see potential in the tactic of making the four progressive lawmakers the face of the Democratic Party in 2020, given that one, Ocasio-Cortez, identifies as a democratic socialist. “The tactics are deeply flawed but the Squad makes an excellent foil for Trump," Conant said.
Trump has attacked some of the Democrats vying for the 2020 nomination — tossing out “sleepy Joe Biden" and calling Senator Kamala Harris “nasty" — but nothing has seemed to stick.
“He wants to contrast with some of the more liberal elements of the party and that's why he's picked this group of liberal congresswomen," said Ryan Williams, a former staffer on Mitt Romney's presidential run, who added that he doesn't support the way in which the president attacked the women.
There's a long tradition of presidents and politicians creating foils who they think are easier to run against than the candidate who actually appears on the ticket. President Bill Clinton tied his opponent Bob Dole to the unpopular Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich. And former Senate majority leader Harry Reid used the specter of the billionaire donor Koch brothers to motivate Democrats in key Senate races.
Conservatives are already signaling that the Squad will be their foil for 2020. Fox News focuses on them, and particularly Ocasio-Cortez, so much that the satirical Onion website joked the cable network was debuting a premium channel featuring 24-hour coverage of her.
Democrats are skeptical that strategy will pay off, betting that instead, Trump targeting four progressive women of color will only motivate their side. In the midterm elections, Democrats were able to pick up Republican districts in part by motivating suburban voters who were turned off by Trump's incendiary comments.
“As far as we're concerned, he declared war," said LaTosha Brown, the cofounder of Black Voters Matter, a political group designed to expand the black vote. “Women are going to organize and activate."
Far from worrying about the political fallout of elevating the Squad, Democratic activists see danger in the original cracks in party unity that Trump seized upon. The controversy began when Pelosi told The New York Times earlier this month that the four lawmakers have their “Twitter world" but no “following" within the House, following a dispute when the Squad didn't back a compromise bill for border funding Pelosi had put forward.
Ocasio-Cortez shot back that Pelosi was singling out four women of color, which led to another round of recriminations.
It highlighted the division between Pelosi's pragmatism — which is fueled by a need to reelect the moderate Democrats who created her House majority — with the more confrontational, and impatient, liberal wing of the party.
Trump's attack has papered over that division for now, with Pelosi leading the charge to censure the president for his words. But the stylistic and ideological differences remain, and further infighting could be a drain on Democratic enthusiasm in 2020.
Getting those voters, including young people and people of color, to the polls would be crucial to Democratic victories.
“The big risk is for Nancy Pelosi to give an opening to Trump," said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a national advocacy network of women of color. “I don't fear Trump's base of voters expanding as much as I do the core voters and women of color not to be motivated and to feel like the Democratic Party doesn't have our best interest in mind."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When the first emails and tweets surfaced about a power failure on the West Side of Manhattan, I thought it might be isolated to a small number of buildings.
But as it became clear that it was larger than that, I quickly marshaled editors and reporters from Metro, with the help of the Metro editor, Clifford Levy, and from the Express team, for which I am the weekend editor.
Having been through the blackouts of 1977 and 2003, I was hyper-aware of how these situations could cascade into something much more widespread. I was 12 years old and living in the Bronx during the 1977 blackout, and the looting and violence that followed are seared in my memory. During the 2003 blackout, working in an upstate New York newsroom, I wore a small battery-operated light strapped to my head to help me see.
In those early moments of Saturday night's blackout, I was unsure about what was coming and braced for the worst. It's no wonder my wife refers to me as "the master of disaster."
Below are highlights of our real-time conversations on the messaging app Slack. They have been lightly edited to fix typos.

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

Sen. Mazie Hirono joins colleagues in questioning use of climate change data by U.S. Geological Survey

Texto completo: U.S. Sen. Mazie K. Hirono is among 22 senators to express concern today that political bias is making its way to the U.S. Geological Survey, with new policies and restrictions.
In a letter to USGS director James Reilly, the senators cited a recent New York Times report that the USGS has decided to use climate models projecting the effects of climate change only through 2040 instead of the end of the century, the previously accepted practice. The letter was signed by 21 Democrats and one independent.
They questioned the decision, particularly when the data is used as the basis for many important planning decisions by local, state, and federal governments. In addition, the senators questioned new restrictions placed on USGS scientists to speak publicly about their research results without prior permission.
“This decision appears to be another in a long line of politically motivated moves within the Department of the Interior, and more broadly across this administration, to suppress climate change science,” the senators said in the letter.
The senators said the limits would conceal the impacts humans will face during the middle and end of the century time frame that were included in the most recent and fourth National Climate Assessment.
“Hiding this information from the American public not only paralyzes the ability to execute informed decision-making today to reduce future emissions impacts,” said the letter, “but would be further compounded by the administration’s intent to leave the ‘worst case scenario’ out of future assessments and their attempt to discredit this scenario in the NCA4.”
The assessment warned that if fossil fuel use continues unrestrained, the Earth’s atmosphere could warm by as much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, which would result in decreasing food production and negative impacts on public health.
The senators requested a response from Reilly by July 25. The letter was also signed by U.S. Sens Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Tom Udall (D-N.M), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Angus King (I-Maine), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Ben Cardin (D-Md.).

Texto completo: Sweeping immigration raids that were slated to to take place across the country on Sunday didn't materialize, with few reports of arrests while federal officials said they were shifting to a softer rollout of enforcement action.
In New Jersey, immigrant communities and their advocates were closely monitoring the national news and remaining on guard. On Sunday, more than 50 people gathered at St. Lucy's Church in Newark to hear a presentation on what they should do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came knocking on their door.
"I'm sad, because this is a country where we should feel free," said Luis Santamaria of West New York, who attended an information session for immigrants held at St. Lucy's on Sunday morning. "But instead we have found rejection."
A few people expressed their fears of being taken away and separated from their spouses and U.S. citizen children.
Carlos Garay of Newark was among them. He has two U.S.-born children, and he said he thinks twice before leaving his house every morning for work. He said he has already spoken to his sister-in-law, a U.S. citizen, about taking care of his children if anything were to happen to him.
"You always have so much fear because the children are growing," Garay said in Spanish. "For years, I was here alone, and when a man is here alone, a man can fight alone, but when time passes and you have a family, then fear sets in."
Jorge Torres, lead organizer for Faith in New Jersey, which set up the information session, spoke of a few tips to keep the undocumented community safe. He urged attendees to know their rights and always ask for identification and a warrant if ICE agents stop at their homes.
Main streets in cities and towns with large immigrant populations seemed to have less traffic on Sunday morning, as activists set out to inform community members of their rights, while others attended a protest near the Elizabeth immigration detention center.
The Trump administration had altered its plans from a large-scale operation to a smaller set of arrests over the week after news reports tipped off immigrant communities about the raids, The New York Times reported Sunday, citing Department of Homeland Security officials familiar with the operation.
Immigration advocates had expected arrests in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York and San Francisco during the raids. Trump said convicted criminals in the country illegally were being targeted first.
Advocates were also concerned about "collateral" arrests, meaning authorities might detain immigrants who happened to be on the scene, even though they were not targets of the raids.
Although there were no reports of any mass sweeps in New Jerseyor elsewhere in the country as of early Sunday afternoon, Torres warned that everyone should be on alert at all times.
"We need to keep organizing, we need to keep attending meetings and we need to do training, and look for organizations, but we have to stop thinking that everything is OK," he said. "The reason we are here is because we are scared."
Torres said that in his hometown of New Brunswick, main streets were nearly empty in the morning, and that he received similar calls from activists in Elizabeth, Atlantic City and Newark.
Erika Viviana Jacho, a school board member in the township of Belleville, who attended the gathering, said she had begun to carry her U.S. passport in case she encountered federal immigration agents. Jacho, who immigrated to the United States from Ecuador years ago, said she is vulnerable simply because she is an immigrant.
"The scare starts today," she said as she displayed her passport.
Meanwhile, in Elizabeth, Make the Road New Jersey, an organization that lobbies for immigrant rights, and its partner organizations protested outside an Amazon warehouse near the Elizabeth immigration detention center. The protesters are demanding that Amazon cut its ties with ICE.

Rallies Keep Up Political Pressure in Hong Kong

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday in a peaceful rally that descended into clashes inside a shopping mall as the police tried to clear out a small group of younger demonstrators.
The march was the protesters' latest effort to spread their movement across the semiautonomous Chinese region and the first major test of public sentiment since the city's embattled leader announced that an unpopular bill was "dead" but stopped short of withdrawing it.
Dark rain clouds loomed as the large mass of protesters marched through the Sha Tin area of the New Territories, a region of Hong Kong near the border with mainland China, and shouted slogans like "The police knowingly broke the law" and "Fight on, Hong Kong."
In the late afternoon, scuffles broke out as police officers wielding shields and batons deployed pepper spray against a small group of protesters, some of whom pelted the officers with plastic bottles and traffic cones.
As night fell, a tense standoff formed between protesters and police officers in riot gear. Around 7 p.m., a pro-democracy lawmaker, Ted Hui, and several local officials from Sha Tin sat cross-legged in the middle of the road between the officers and the protesters and demanded to speak with the police commander.
[A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
By 10 p.m., as the police tried to clear the streets in the mostly residential neighborhood, the demonstrators had scattered and many ended up regrouping in a shopping mall. Soon after, the police moved into the mall and were met with protesters who had filled the floors overlooking the atrium and were throwing bottles and umbrellas at the officers on the ground floor.
The police struck at the protesters with batons and pushed them with shields, and officers were seen dragging several of them away. Local television footage showed some protesters surrounding and kicking a police officer who appeared to be on the ground. Other protesters were being treated by medics.
According to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, 28 people were admitted to hospitals on Sunday for injuries. By Monday morning, eight people had been discharged and two remained in critical condition.
The police said 10 officers had been injured in the clashes. One officer had part of a finger bitten off by a protester after he gouged the man's eye with it.
The Hong Kong government said it condemned the actions of those protesters who blocked roads, assaulted police officers and disrupted the peace. "The rule of law is the cornerstone of Hong Kong, and the society will absolutely not tolerate such violent acts," it said in a statement late Sunday.
Several pro-democracy lawmakers criticized the police's handling of the demonstration, saying that officers who stormed into the mall in full riot gear had set off panic among the protesters.
The demonstration in Sha Tin came one day after clashes broke out between police officers and protesters in a Hong Kong border town.
The protest on Saturday concerned so-called parallel traders, who come across the border from the mainland to buy items like baby formula and diapers for resale in China -- hurting consumers in Hong Kong, critics of the practice say. Two protesters were arrested, including on charges of unlawful assembly.
On Sunday morning, before the demonstration in Sha Tin began, hundreds of people also participated in a silent march organized by several local journalism associations in the city's financial district to protest what they say was the excessive use of force by police officers against members of the news media during previous demonstrations.
Hong Kong has been rocked by a wave of mass demonstrations since early June amid a public uproar over a piece of legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Though Carrie Lam, the city's chief executive, suspended the bill, she has refused to formally retract it.
It the biggest political crisis in the former British colony since it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The complete withdrawal of the extradition bill is one of the protesters' five main demands. They are also seeking universal suffrage, the retraction of the government's characterization of a protest on June 12 as a "riot," the unconditional release of all protesters arrested, and an independent inquiry into police violence against protesters.
But Mrs. Lam has shown little willingness to meet the protesters' demands, and both sides now appear to be dug in for what many expect will be a summer of unrest in the city.
"This has become an issue of political structure," said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer in government at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
"The younger people cannot find a way to change the political situation of Hong Kong and master their own future," Mr. Choy said. "So they have to come out and go to the streets or use even more confrontational methods to force the government to pay more attention to their opinion."
Protesters on Sunday added two local issues to the five main demands, calling for an end to the politically motivated disqualification of candidates for elected office and more open discussion of the extradition bill at the district level.
But they differed as to their top priorities.
Horus Leung and Matthew Lee, both university students, said they were most concerned about the rough treatment of protesters by the police.
"The police used to serve the citizens, but now they've become a political tool in oppressing protesters' voices," said Mr. Leung, 18. "They are no longer neutral."
Mr. Lee said that while he was tired after attending a number of protests in recent weeks, it was imperative to keep the momentum going.
"If we don't stand up now, we won't have a chance later," he said. "We have no choice -- this is our home and there's nowhere else for us to go."
Others said they would not be satisfied until all of the protesters' demands were met.
"Not one of our five demands can be missing," said Ip Chuen-mui, 64, a house cleaner and longtime resident of Sha Tin, "or else we will keep coming out."
The march in Sha Tin on Sunday was the latest attempt by protesters to get out their message and sustain momentum for the movement.
Last week, tens of thousands of protesters turned out for a demonstration in Kowloon, a region of Hong Kong across the harbor from the financial district where most of the protests took place last month. It was the first major action after the dramatic storming of the city's legislative building by a small group of protesters this month.
Unlike the pro-democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong in 2014, the recent demonstrations have been notable for their largely leaderless nature. Many of the recent marches and gatherings have been organized through online forums and the Telegram messaging app.
The movement has also adopted decidedly low-tech messaging strategies in the form of thousands of colorful sticky notes, most expressing support for the protesters and their demands. So-called Lennon Walls, named after a memorial in Prague dedicated to the singer John Lennon, have been popping up around the city over the last few weeks.
In recent days, however, scuffles have broken out when some people tried to rip down the displays.

Within Both Parties, the Twitter Brigade Brawls With the Establishment

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- On the night that he conceded defeat in 1992 after the most successful independent presidential campaign of the last century, Ross Perot made it clear that he was not done shaking up the established order. "Believe me," he declared, "the system needs some shocks."
So perhaps it was only fitting that on the same week that Mr. Perot died nearly 27 years later, both of the two major political parties were being rattled by the aftershocks of the earthquake that his campaign represented. President Trump was busy quarreling with former Speaker Paul D. Ryan while the current speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was bickering with first-year House Democrats.
In both cases, those who represented the institutional order, Mr. Ryan and Ms. Pelosi, found themselves at odds with rabble-rousers within their own parties agitating for change from outside the traditional system through the power of social media. This was not a week that showcased the competition between the parties but within them. The stress fractures that Mr. Perot identified a generation ago are tearing at the foundations of the Republican and Democratic Parties.
"This really is the crackup," said Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic former Chicago mayor, congressman and White House chief of staff. "Usually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania Avenue versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today's squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades."
Mr. Emanuel saw up close Mr. Perot's campaign in 1992 (and then again in 1996) as an aide to Bill Clinton, and today he identifies that moment as "the beginning point of the crackup of the parties." In the years since, the Bushes and Clintons have given way to Twitter-armed outsiders like Mr. Trump and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and "the squad" of her fellow Democratic insurgents in Congress.
[Ross Perot, a brash Texas billionaire who ran for president, dies at 89.]
The difference is that Mr. Trump successfully staged a hostile takeover of the Republican Party in 2016 and has since brought much of its old establishment to heel, driving the likes of Mr. Ryan out the door or into hiding. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her compatriots have not taken over the Democratic Party, but they are driving the conversation within it to a degree that few first-year House members have ever done, thanks to their online armies of like-minded disrupters tired of what they see as the corrupt status quo.
Mr. Trump's dust-up with Mr. Ryan this week originated with the publication of "American Carnage," a new book on the Republican civil war by Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine. In the book, Mr. Ryan, who stepped down as speaker in January, described his frustrations trying to deal with Mr. Trump, who, he said, "didn't know anything about government." As Mr. Ryan put it, "I wanted to scold him all the time."
Mr. Trump, the first president in American history who arrived in Washington without a single day of government or military experience but with tens of millions of followers on Twitter eager for him to break up the system, characteristically fired back at Mr. Ryan. In late-night tweets from the White House, Mr. Trump dismissed the former speaker as "a long running lame duck failure" whose "record of achievement was atrocious."
The flare-up between Ms. Pelosi and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies, Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, in some ways echoed those themes.
In an interview with the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Ms. Pelosi complained that the upstarts did not understand how government works, dismissing their digital following as "their public whatever." They in turn complained that Ms. Pelosi's record of achievement was inadequate because she was too willing to compromise rather than confront Republicans on issues like the migrant crisis at the border.
There is, of course, no little irony that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Ryan are now the beleaguered defenders of the old order, given that both of them were once seen as champions of the ideological extremes of their parties -- she as a radical San Francisco leftist, he as a Medicare-destroying right winger.
But they both came up within the system that is now under pressure from impatient newcomers who see no virtue in spending years in the backbenches waiting for their turn when they can be empowered by Twitter to wield influence in ways that would have been unthinkable in the past.
"Because of social media and because people can be their own stars, they don't need to work through leadership or through hierarchy," said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey and a leader of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group seeking to find consensus in a House where that is a dirty word. "They work outside in. That is a huge challenge because technology allows it."
The outsiders are, in their own ways, tapping into the same disenchantment with the two-party system that Mr. Perot did. When he attracted 19 percent of the vote in 1992 against Mr. Clinton and President George Bush, it was the most any independent presidential candidate had generated since Theodore Roosevelt's unsuccessful comeback bid in 1912 and the most any independent candidate who had not previously served as president had received since the advent of the two current parties just before the Civil War.
Since then, even more Americans have chosen to dissociate from the two parties. As recently as July 2004, only 27 percent of Americans called themselves independent in Gallup polling; today, 15 years later, 46 percent do. Most of those still vote reliably for one party or the other, so they are not truly swing voters who bounce back and forth depending on the year and the candidate. But they are sufficiently turned off enough by the parties not to want a D or an R next to their names.
In 2003, 56 percent of Americans interviewed by Gallup said the two political parties did an adequate job. By last year, 57 percent said a third major party was needed. Younger Americans feel that even more strongly; 71 percent in an NBC/GenForward poll in 2017 said that they wanted a third party.
Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who supports impeaching Mr. Trump, reflected that when he left the Republican Party on the Fourth of July. "The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions," he wrote in The Washington Post.
But Mr. Perot's experience offers a cautionary tale. For all his money and easy access to television -- "Larry King Live" was his Twitter -- he still could not crack the duopoly. By the time he ran in 1996, again targeting the two-party system with a vow to "kill that little snake this time," his share of the popular vote fell to 8 percent. The Reform Party that he created was ultimately taken over by marginal figures -- Mr. Trump ran for that party's 2000 nomination before dropping out -- and faded from the scene.
What Mr. Trump took from Mr. Perot's experience was that breaking the two-party system from the outside did not work; instead, he had to take over one of the parties from the inside.
"The two-party system has been bankrupt for at least a decade," said former Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. But "the barriers to entry in this space are extremely high," and only Mr. Trump has figured out how to harness Americans' frustration.
"If the two-party system remains incapable of addressing our nation's greatest challenges and most controversial issues, younger generations of Americans will find a third way," Mr. Curbelo said. "Unlike older voters, they will not remain complacent or resign themselves to this political misery."
Nancy Jacobson, founder and chief executive of No Labels, a bipartisan group created in 2010, said the advent of Mr. Trump, combined with what could be a leftward lurch by the Democrats next year, could set the stage for a third party.
"The outsider populists are making it so the problem-solving voters in each party have more in common with each other than with the extremes in their current parties," she said. "They could be forced into a new marriage."
Maybe, maybe not. But the threat of divorce within the parties feels palpable.

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing – to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage – to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Bouton opened the lid on ol' boy network of baseball

Texto completo: It is difficult to know where to begin in writing about Jim Bouton, who died this week at age 80. If he had never written "Ball Four," Bouton would no doubt have still merited a New York Times obituary as a former Yankees pitcher who won 21 games in 1963 and 18 in 1964 and then tacked on two World Series wins that October.
But a sore arm cost Bouton his fastball and caused him to end up pitching as a 30-year-old knuckleballer for the expansion Seattle Pilots at the start of the 1969 season. It was also probably the reason he was willing to team with longtime sportswriter Leonard Shecter on a book chronicling that season. Before it was over, Bouton had been sent to Class AAA Vancouver, returned to Seattle and then been traded to Houston.
Bouton never stopped taking notes. A year later, "Ball Four," written in diary form, was published and became arguably the most iconic baseball book ever written. Some will argue for Roger Kahn's lyrically brilliant "Boys of Summer," but nothing changed baseball or sports journalism as much as Bouton's seminal work.
Never before had an athlete written with as much honesty, candor and humor about what life was like inside a locker room. "Ball Four" went to places no athlete had previously gone.
Bouton shocked people by writing honestly about good ol' boy Yankee Mickey Mantle - not so much about all his home runs but rather his drinking, womanizing and his mean streak. His description of joining Yankees teammates on the roof of the Washington's Shoreham Hotel to "beaver-shoot" - check out women through their hotel windows - would be unacceptable in today's world, and Bouton's revelation of it infuriated baseball insiders.
Bouton took ordinary players and made them into icons. Journeyman pitcher Gary Bell yelling, "Smoke 'em inside," as his scouting report for every hitter in baseball; Alvin Dark's famous "take a hike, son," remark to an autograph seeker. And, of course, there was Seattle manager Joe Schultz's "Let's go pound some Budweiser," war cry and his ability to repeat his two favorite profane words in, as Bouton wrote, "all their possible combinations."
"Ball Four" has sold more than 5 million copies - Bouton updated it often - so there are plenty of people who will know those anecdotes and many more by heart.
The book also made Bouton into a baseball pariah.
When it came out in 1970, he was reprimanded by commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who called the book "detrimental to baseball." Kuhn also asked Bouton to sign a statement saying that the book was fiction. Bouton, naturally, refused.
Kuhn was hardly the only one to take issue with it. Players and many longtime baseball writers, some of whom considered themselves part of their teams, agreed with Kuhn.
No doubt many writers were simply jealous. In those days, with the wide-open access the media had, a good reporter could have told many of the same stories that Bouton told. But no one wanted to be drummed from the fraternity.
The irony is that few loved baseball more than Bouton. He made a comeback with the Atlanta Braves in 1978 - eight years after first leaving the game - and pitched in semipro leagues into his 50s.
The final line of "Ball Four" poignantly expresses Bouton's feeling about the game: "You see," he wrote, "you spend a good deal of your life gripping a baseball and, in the end, it turns out that it was the other way around all the time."
He also wrote often about sometimes "forgetting to tingle" as he walked across the outfield grass to the bullpen before a game, reminding himself how lucky he was to make a living playing baseball.
Bouton wrote a number of other books, including "Foul Ball," about his efforts to save a minor league ballpark in Pittsfield, Mass., where he had settled after retirement. The book was written in the same diary form as "Ball Four," and although the topic was completely different, had the same funny, anecdotal feel to it.
The book was also poignant. Bouton describes the death, in 1997, of his daughter Laurie in a car accident. He also addressed a New York Times op-ed written by his son Michael pleading with the Yankees to release him from baseball purgatory and invite him to Old Timers Day.
The Yankees relented and invited Bouton, who joyfully recounts his return to the Yankees' clubhouse and the mixed reactions of his former teammates.
I wrote a favorable review of "Foul Ball" and was thrilled when Bouton reached out to thank me.
That began a sporadic friendship, most of it on the phone. I loved hearing Bouton's views of baseball today and his stories about old friends and teammates who had stayed in touch.
Bouton isn't a Hall of Famer, but baseball should find a way to pay tribute to Bouton and acknowledge, almost 50 years later, his massive influence on the game.
As for sports journalism, we were all influenced by him.
Bouton proved the importance of firsthand reporting, of truly getting inside a subject. No book other than "All the President's Men," influenced me more as a reporter. Woodward, Bernstein, Bouton - pretty good role models.
Bouton did one other thing for me. Whenever I'm having a tough day at a ballgame, I look around and I think about what Bouton would have said.
"Don't forget to tingle."
Thanks, Jim.

'Democracy's detectives' — Gazette launching a statewide investigative team

Texto completo: After 156 women athletes came forward to say they were abused by Dr. Larry Nassar, Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis singled out for praise three people who started the reckoning with the disgraced doctor’s two decades of sexual abuse.
She didn’t credit the hundreds of people who work at USA Gymnastics or the United States Olympic Committee, which oversees USA Gymnastics. Nor prosecutors in the state of Michigan. Nor police. Nor the FBI, which was investigating the doctor at the time. Nor Michigan State University, where he was employed and presumably supervised.
No, she praised three investigative reporters at The Indianapolis Star.

“What finally started this reckoning and ended this decadeslong cycle of abuse was investigative reporting,” prosecutor Povilaitis said at the sentencing.
“Without that first Indianapolis Star story in August of 2016, without the story where (former gymnast) Rachael (Denhollander) came forward publicly shortly thereafter, he would still be practicing medicine, treating athletes and abusing kids,” Povilaitis said.
If it weren’t for investigative reporters, we also wouldn’t know about the horrible wait times at VA clinics a few years ago or the terrible conditions at veterans nursing homes. We wouldn’t know about Russian interference in U.S. elections or the sexual abuses that triggered the #MeToo movement, either.
In our own backyard, we wouldn’t have known that an increasing number of soldiers, including wounded combat veterans, were being kicked out of the service for misconduct, often with no benefits, as the Army downsized after a decade of war. The Gazette investigation into “other than honorable” discharges won a Pulitzer Prize.
And we wouldn’t know right now that our entire mental health care system is in a state of acute crisis in Colorado.
Investigative journalists are democracy’s detectives, as one author put it recently.
“Getting to the bottom of things takes hard work, dedication, digging, asking tough questions, a refusal to quit,” says investigative reporter Christopher Osher. “The work matters. It can be the difference between life and death for someone at times, the difference between freedom or imprisonment other times. It can mean the difference in millions of dollars paid in taxes going to waste or a more efficient, effective government.”
So we couldn’t be prouder that Osher is joining The Gazette to launch a statewide investigative reporting team to continue the work that matters.
The new three-person team, which will be based in Denver, will focus on investigative reporting projects across Colorado for The Gazette and Colorado Politics, with a strong emphasis on holding politicians and state agencies accountable for how they spend our tax dollars.
We’re launching this team because we see an unmet need in the state for deeply reported accountability journalism. While there are more and more sources of information out there, fewer and fewer of them are truly reliable. Yet, the need to dig through those mounds of data and find the facts is more important than ever.
Facebook may be fun in a scrapbook kind of way, and Twitter is titillating to be sure, but the Wimbledon of information is still newspapers, some of which, like The Gazette, have been doing this for nearly 125 years. (Coincidentally, Wimbledon is 125 years old, too.) And center court in that Wimbledon of information is investigative reporting.
“During my career,” Osher told me, “I’ve learned just how messed up systems can become and how accepted ways of doing things can have devastating consequences on people, families and children. It can take the force of good journalism — that unflinching, hard work — to uncover the truth and force change.”
Chris worked from 2005 through 2018 as a reporter at The Denver Post, with more than a decade of that time on the newspaper’s investigative reporting team. He has investigated issues ranging from the state’s troubled child protective system to problems in law enforcement, health care and parole operations. Since January, he has been a reporter for the online news platform The Colorado Sun, where he specialized in reporting on statewide educational issues. His work has garnered recognition in national, regional and local journalism awards contests. Before moving to Colorado, he worked for newspapers in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Ohio, Iowa and Virginia. He also spent time reporting from war zones in Africa.
“One of my mentors was a professor at the University of Arkansas, Roy Reed, who had covered the civil rights crisis for The New York Times as a correspondent in the South,” Chris told me.
“From him, I learned that it took the unflinching coverage of the news media for the country to begin to come to terms with the scars that Jim Crow laws had left. I give a lot of credit to Mr. Reed and others, such as Bill Kovach, another journalist from the South who became national editor at The New York Times and then editor at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, where I worked briefly as an intern. I learned from them that reporters have a sacred and awesome responsibility to unveil the truth wherever that might lead.
“I can tell from just my brief interactions with reporters at The Gazette and Colorado Politics that all of these values and ideals already exist at both publications and that there’s a strong foundation there already. I’m excited to contribute and help take things to new levels.”

N.R.A. Faces New Scrutiny Over Actions Of Its Charity

Texto completo: The attorney general for the District of Columbia, Karl A. Racine, has opened a new investigative front against the National Rifle Association, issuing subpoenas on Friday to the gun group and a large affiliated charity.
While the N.R.A. is already under investigation in New York, where it was chartered nearly 150 years ago, its charity was created in Washington, giving Mr. Racine's office local authority over the organization. Among other things, the new inquiry will examine how funds were moved between the N.R.A. and the charity, known as the N.R.A. Foundation, and whether that money was properly used for charitable purposes.
Earlier this year, The New York Times reported that more than $ 200 million has flowed from the foundation to the N.R.A. since 2010. That issue has also been a subject of scrutiny in the investigation by the New York attorney general, Letitia James. Donations to the foundation are tax-deductible, while donations to the N.R.A. itself are not. The N.R.A. has said all of the transfers were done properly.
In a statement on Friday, Mr. Racine's office said it had issued subpoenas "as part of an investigation into whether these entities violated the district's Nonprofit Act." The office said it was interested in examining "financial records, payments to vendors, and payments to officers and directors."
The N.R.A.'s outside counsel, William A. Brewer III, said in a statement that the group would "cooperate with any appropriate inquiry into its finances," adding that its "financials are audited and its tax filings are verified by one of the most reputable firms in the world."
Under local law, Mr. Racine's office can go to court to seek to dissolve nonprofit corporations, or place them in receivership, if they are found to have misused funds. The office can also take other actions, including restricting the compensation paid to the group's leadership.
Mr. Racine is the district's first elected attorney general. In 2017, his office joined Maryland in suing President Trump, claiming that profiting from government guests staying at his Washington hotel violated the Constitution. The case was dismissed this week by a federal appeals court panel.
The new N.R.A. investigation comes amid a head-spinning year for the gun group, which is facing numerous legal battles, a rebellion among some donors and relentless infighting that led to the resignation of its second-in-command, Christopher W. Cox, last month, and the departure of its president, Oliver L. North, in April. So far, however, less than a handful of the N.R.A.'s 76 board members have publicly criticized Wayne LaPierre, the longtime chief executive.
There have been a number of signs of financial stress in recent years. The N.R.A. has put up the deed to its headquarters to secure a line of credit, borrowed against insurance policies taken out on executives, frozen its pension fund and grappled with escalating legal fees.
It has also become increasingly reliant on the N.R.A. Foundation. Transfers from the foundation listed for charitable purposes have risen fivefold since 2001, and the N.R.A. pulled roughly $ 30 million out of the charity in 2017, records show.
The investigation by Mr. Racine's office will additionally examine whether the N.R.A. used charitable funds to provide private benefits to N.R.A. officials, and whether payments were improperly made by N.R.A. contractors like Ackerman McQueen, the association's former advertising firm, which paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for clothing and travel expenses for Mr. LaPierre.
Mr. Brewer, in his statement, said that "the association has an appropriate conflict-of-interest policy, which provides that all potential conflicts are reviewed and scrutinized by the Audit Committee. The N.R.A. is committed to utilizing best practices in the areas of accounting and governance."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Pete Buttigieg, whose presidential campaign is struggling to appeal to African-American voters even as it gains more support from Democratic donors, on Thursday released a plan to “dismantle racist structures and systems" in the federal government.
Buttigieg's announcement comes after weeks of scrutiny of his record on racial justice as mayor of South Bend, Ind., where a white police officer shot and killed a black man last month.
The episode turned into a severe test of his leadership, spawning protests among South Bend's black residents and raising questions about his handling of policing issues in the city. Buttigieg suspended his campaign for several days to return and meet with members of the black community.
Buttigieg has offered a frank acknowledgment of his shortcomings in this area, saying during last month's debate that he has not done a sufficient job recruiting police officers of color during his seven years as mayor.
“I couldn't get it done," he said.
Without increasing his standing among black voters, Buttigieg faces a difficult path to the White House. He entered the campaign largely unknown among black voters, many of whom received their first introduction to him through news about the South Bend shooting.
The policy proposal Buttigieg unveiled Thursday includes health, education, and voting-rights reforms. But it is particularly focused on addressing discrimination in policing and criminal justice.
His goals include many of the major changes sought by liberal criminal justice reform groups, and in some cases conservative groups as well.
They include eliminating federal incarceration for drug possession and reducing sentences for other drug offenses; legalizing marijuana at the federal level; limiting solitary confinement; and abolishing the death penalty and mandatory minimum sentencing.
Buttigieg also called for the establishment of several measures specifically addressing policing.
Derek Cohen, the director of Right on Crime, a leader in conservative efforts to reform the criminal justice system, estimated that 20 percent of Buttigieg's proposals were within the purview of the federal government.

Price tag for Trump's July 4 event now at $5.4m
WASHINGTON — President Trump's July Fourth extravaganza — featuring tanks, a military flyover, and a Trump speech at the Lincoln Memorial — cost an estimated $5.4 million, according to rough figures Thursday.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt provided the latest share of costs, $2.45 million for his agency, in a letter to lawmakers, saying his agency pulled money from operating funds for national parks, recreation fees, and another source to help fund Trump's Salute to America.
The event included donated fireworks, a military flyover, and Trump's speech to a rained-on crowd at the Lincoln Memorial.
Trump announced Monday he would do it all again next year, calling the event "remarkable."
Democratic lawmakers have condemned the extra expenditures for the Independence Day celebration, which came in addition to the traditional concert, fireworks, and events held near the US Capitol.
Arizona Democratic Representative Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and one of several Democrats who had demanded a full cost accounting, said in response to Interior's funding estimates that the public funds were spent to "celebrate President Trump."
Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations' spending for concerts, parades, and other celebrations in and around the National Mall. Interior's costs included crowd accommodations such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.
In addition, the Department of Defense says its costs came to $1.2 million. Despite repeated requests, the Pentagon as of Thursday refused to provide a precise breakdown.
The military's efforts included positioning tanks on flat-bed trailers around the capital, meeting Trump's desire for tanks while minimizing damage to district roads from the heavy armor.
Separately, Washington Mayor Muriel E. Bowser wrote Trump to say the district's costs for Trump's July Fourth event have drained a special fund used to provide security and protect the nation's capital from terrorist threats.
The District of Columbia estimates it spent about $1.7 million, not including police expenses for related demonstrations. Bowser wrote Trump that the fund will have a $6 million deficit by September, reminding the president that the account was never reimbursed for $7.3 million in expenses from Trump's 2017 inauguration.
White House spokesman Judd Deere says officials will respond "in a timely manner."

Joint Chiefs nominee says keep troops in Afghanistan
WASHINGTON — Pulling American troops prematurely from Afghanistan would be a "strategic mistake," the Army general nominated to be Joint Chiefs chairman told senators Thursday. Mark Milley also said the United States should keep a "modest number" of forces in Iraq and Syria for now to maintain stability.
Milley assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that he will give his candid advice to President Trump regardless of any potential consequences to himself.
"We've buried soldiers. Arlington is full of our comrades. We understand absolutely full well the hazards of our chosen profession," Milley said, in response to questions from Senator Angus King, Independent of Maine, about whether he would be willing to tell Trump that he thought the president was wrong on any issue. "We know what this is about and we are not going to be intimidated into making stupid decisions."
The 61-year-old Milley, who is Trump's pick to replace General Joseph Dunford, said "no one, ever" would intimidate him.

U.N. to investigate Philippine police killings

Texto completo: The United Nations' top human rights body voted Thursday to examine thousands of alleged extrajudicial police killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs in the Philippines, a campaign that rights groups around the world have denounced as a lawless atrocity.
The U.N.'s 47-member Human Rights Council supported a resolution led by Iceland that turned a spotlight on wide-ranging abuses, including killings; enforced disappearances; arbitrary arrests; and persecution of rights activists, journalists, lawyers and members of the political opposition.
Despite fierce opposition from Philippine officials, 18 countries backed the resolution, while 14 opposed it and 15 others abstained.
The Philippine foreign minister, Teodoro Locsin, in a statement read by his ambassador in Geneva, denounced the resolution as a travesty of human rights that came "straight from the mouth of the queen in Alice in Wonderland."
"Do not presume to threaten states with accountability for a tough approach to crushing crime" in which some countries were complicit and others tolerant, he said.
The resolution stopped short of setting up a full-fledged commission of inquiry but calls on the U.N. human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, to prepare a comprehensive report for delivery to the council in a year's time. That would set the stage for tougher follow-up action if abuses continued unabated, diplomats said. "It's a modest resolution, but it is a very critical step to putting the Philippines on the track to accountability and to show that the killing of thousands of drug war victims has not gone unnoticed by the international community," said Laila Matar, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's group monitoring the United Nations.
In the run-up to Thursday's vote, Philippine diplomats lobbied fiercely to dissuade council members from supporting what they considered to be a hostile resolution.
In light of that effort, supporters of the resolution considered it something of a victory that so many countries abstained rather than opposing the measure. The vote came just days after one of the drug war's youngest victims, 3-year-old Myca Ulpina, was killed in a police raid.
The Philippine government has acknowledged at least 6,600 deaths in the anti-drug campaign since 2016, but human rights groups believe the death toll is much higher.
Amnesty International, in a report last week, described Duterte's war on drugs as "nothing but a large-scale murdering enterprise" mainly targeting the poor.
"It is not safe to be poor in President Duterte's Philippines. All it takes to be murdered is an unproven accusation that someone uses, buys or sells drugs," said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia. "It is time for the United Nations, starting with its Human Rights Council, to act decisively to hold President Duterte and his government accountable."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Hundreds of people gathered Friday night for Washington’s “Lights for Liberty” event and vigil, one of more than 700 that were planned across five continents to raise awareness of conditions in immigrant detention facilities in the southern United States.
A large group from the American Federation of Teachers marched to the event, chanting “classrooms, not cages. ” They were welcomed by the executive director of CASA, Gustavo Torres. CASA is the nation's largest advocacy group for Latino immigrants.
“Si se puede,” Torres said. “Yes, we can!”
Organizers of “Lights for Liberty” said that D. C. was one of the first cities they planned a vigil in, specifically to “demand action from Congress to end concentration camps and impeach the President,” according to the group's website.
Pence lauds border conditions: 'Care every American would be proud of'
Donald Trump: Immigration raids begin Sunday, will target criminals 'as much as we can'
At least 30,000 immigrants are detained on any given day in the United States, just in the five states with the highest numbers, according to an organization called Freedom for Immigrants.
Shyamali Hauth, 53, who served in the Air Force for 10 years, attended Friday's event with with a local chapter of the progressive Indivisible movement.
“The way we’re treating people seeking asylum here is absolutely atrocious,” Hauth said. She held a large, neon orange “A,” helping to form the word "immoral" alongside her peers.
“It’s not why I served in the military. It’s not the kind of America we should have. ”
The vigils take place amid growing criticism of the conditions in detention facilities. United Nations’ human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the family separation and inhumane conditions in the facilities “should never happen anywhere. ”
The New York Times reported massive Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids of undocumented communities could begin as soon as Sunday. Officials said the Trump administration may be executing the raids as a show of force to discourage families from crossing the border, according to the New York Times.
Before the vigil, a series of speakers took the stage, including Rep. Norma Torres, D-Calif. , the only member of Congress born in Central America; Ruby Corado, the founder of LGBTQ+ immigrant support organization Casa Ruby; Hope Frye, an immigration attorney and Torres.
Torres called on law enforcement officers to stand up for what is right and urged protections for whistleblowers: “We need more of them to come forward and tell us what is really going on. ”
Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigrant and Refugee Services, shared her story of fleeing the Sri Lankan civil war with her family when she was an infant.
So many immigrants, she said, just want to live safe and normal lives in the U. S.
“We admit them not because they are American,” she said, “but because we are American. ”
After faith leaders spoke to the crowd, they gathered on stage with photos of immigrant children who have died recently.
One by one, speakers read out the names of the children. They rang bells after each child.
Later, organizers led the crowd in singing “This Little Light of Mine,” while people waved their electric candles in the air.

The President's Troll Army

Texto completo: On Thursday afternoon, just as the titans of the pro-Trump internet gathered at the White House to commiserate about Big Tech's tyrannous reign of censorship over conservative speech, the entire world was briefly deplatformed by a global Twitter blackout.
If a gaggle of memelords cavort with the president and no one tweets about it, did it even happen?
That's a loaded question, given that the White House's "social media summit" wasn't actually about assembling the internet's greatest minds for a freewheeling discussion on policy. Like any good Trump event, the spectacle is more important than the discussion. The president is a master media manipulator and his "summit" was an excellent case study.
The decision to invite a collection of Photoshoppers, conspiracy peddlers and grandfatherly, semipro Twitter fighters to the White House was a maneuver designed to outrage. That outrage inevitably led to press coverage, as evidenced by the dozens of curtain-raising pieces from technology and political reporters who've covered these personalities from their days of obscurity. Coverage leads to more condemnations. Then, more coverage. An hourlong meeting about technology with a president who has never used email becomes a circus, which boosts the profile of each meeting attendee.
In the age of viral politics, momentum and agenda-setting are born on social media. The ability to program Twitter, for example, is the ability to dictate the news cycle. And when what you tap out on your palm-size screen shows up on cable news chyrons, that translates into TV appearances, more earned media and a nontrivial amount of political capital.
President Trump figured this out long before he ran for office. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez figured it out last summer, and her deft use of the medium has scrambled the brains of her opponents. It appears the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has figured this out as well, which is most likely why she's telling fellow party members to put their phones away.
It's not just cable news that's swayed by a good tweetstorm; true grass-roots support these days is driven primarily by the internet. Recently, the BuzzFeed News editor in chief, Ben Smith, described the new approach as something like social media fandoms. "Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Drake, and the Marvel Universe don't come and go," he wrote. "They're eternal, as long as their protagonists provide a steady stream of content and mutual affirmation to growing groups of supporters."
Despite their Island of Misfit Toys status in the mainstream media world, the livestreamers and provocateurs invited to the White House are agitation propaganda machines. "The crap you think of is unbelievable," Mr. Trump gushed to the room on Thursday. He later followed up with, "It's genius but it's bad."
They're reactive and confrontational. They wear their politics on their sleeves and bring along their own set of facts. Most important, they know how to engage and cultivate that pro-Trump fandom.
Being a memeknight in Trump's service might seem more like role-playing politics from a keyboard. But what happens on Reddit, 4chan, Twitter and Facebook can swing a presidential campaign. The worst of it -- disinformation, violent trolling, doctored videos falsely labeled satire (like the recent Nancy Pelosi clips) -- sloshes into the mainstream and becomes part of the news cycle and forces fact-checkers and candidates to go on the defensive.
Look no further than the rollout of Thursday's summit. The White House declined to release a guest list, leaving the influencers to tweet their invites to their substantial followings -- a slow and steady drip of content. Pro-Trump media without an invitation sniped to reporters, and one member was disinvited over an anti-Semitic cartoon. The event, initially closed to the news media, magically opened up on Thursday morning. Once inside, press and attendees were treated to Twitter-ready posters, defining online terms like deplatforming and demonetization.
It was a meme fever dream of questionable newsworthiness -- all tailor made for reporters with Twitter accounts. And the media is caught in the middle, unsure how to cover a group who, time and again, dupe them into amplifying their propaganda and nonsense. At least we ended up with Mr. Trump's working definition of the First Amendment. "To me free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write bad," he said from the podium. "To me that's very dangerous speech, and you become angry at it. But that's not free speech."
And yet what happened on Thursday is newsworthy. The president has an election to win. Thursday's summit was a public embrace of a group he thinks are powerful allies. The summit suggests that 2016's meme army was just proof of concept for an information war in 2020.
Whatever is coming, we're not prepared.

Texto completo: McLeod Summer Playhouse opens its final professional production of 2019 this weekend with a very special, 60th anniversary production of "Gypsy: A Musical Fable," the play widely acclaimed as "America’s Greatest Book Musical."
Inspired by the memoirs of famous striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee, the play deftly integrates a compelling story, complex characters and memorable Broadway standards such as "Ev’rything’s Comin’ Up Roses," "Let Me Entertain You" and "Together (Wherever We Go)."
MSP’s take on the classic runs July 12 to 21. SIH Medical Group sponsors McLeod Summer Playhouse 2019.
Set in the 1920s and 1930s — a time when Vaudeville moved from it’s heyday into obscurity — the story follows the bombastic and overbearing stage mother Rose as she desperately pushes her daughters June and Louise to fame and fortune as stars in show business.
When younger sister June escapes her mother’s clutches to carve a path of her own, Rose turns her attention to the less-talented Louise, who steps into the spotlight and finds tremendous success in an unexpected new performance career.
"Gypsy" was written in 1959 with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Arthur Laurents, and they immediately followed their success on another Broadway classic, "West Side Story." The well-known score is by the great American standard and Broadway composer Jule Styne.
"We are very excited to bring this great musical theater classic to southern Illinois audiences," says MSP managing artistic director and director of the production, J. Thomas Kidd. "The great New York Times critic Frank Rich has referred to this play as, ‘... the American Musical Theater answer to ‘King Lear’...,’ and once you experience the story of Rose and her unrelenting quest for attention and adoration, you can understand why."
In many ways the real life Rose achieved her dream, Kidd explained.
"Both of her daughters achieved success and fame: June, as the actress June Havoc, had a stage, film and TV career that lasted for over 50 years, and as Gypsy Rose Lee, Louise became one of the most iconic American celebrities, and at the pinnacle of her career, one of the wealthiest," Kidd said. "She once quipped, ‘The hardest thing about being Gypsy Rose Lee is finding a place to put all my money so I can take it to the bank.’ However Rose, as portrayed in the musical, becomes a chilling example of a parent who attempts to live their dreams through their children."
The role was written for the great Ethel Merman, and has since been played by some of the greatest actor-singers of our time including Rosalind Russell, Angela Landsbury, Bette Midler, Bernadette Peters and Patti Lapone.
Stepping into the role for MSP 2019 is Samantha Barboza.
"I met Samantha at auditions in 2014," said Kidd, "I was blown away by her tremendous vocal power. I have tried ever since to entice her away from other companies to spend a summer performing with MSP. This iconic role finally did the trick, and we are thrilled to have her in the show."
Others in the cast include SIU musical theater alum Katelin Coursey as Louise; Derek Brookens (MSP’s "Mamma Mia" and "The Full Monty") as Rose’s love interest, Herbie; 11 year-old Broadway veteran ("Anastasia") Nicole Scimeca as Baby June; and the entire MSP 2019 professional company. Also appearing are five young actors from southern Illinois, playing young Louise and boy backup dancers in the act "Baby June and her Newsboys."
In addition to Kidd, the artistic team includes choreography by Darryl Clark, music direction by Kevin A. Smith and Jenna Mee Dosch, scenic design by Ronald Naversen, costume design by Jennifer Gillette, lighting design by Mark K. Varns, and sound design by Jerome Veit.
* Performances will take place in SIU Carbondale’s McLeod Theater at 7:30 p.m. July 12, 13, 19 and 20, and at 2 p.m. July 14 and 21. General admission prices are $30 for adults, $10 for children and $14 for students. Tickets are available online at events.siu.edu.

America is better than 'just OK' [Corrected 07/13/2019]

Texto completo: Maybe President Donald Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America -- except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life. As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care outcomes than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
Put aside for a moment all the misleading data the video uses to show America is not so great. The fact is, all the freedom and progress those other countries enjoy today would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs. Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea -- the idea of human liberty.
For most of our history, American democracy was a global outlier. In 1938, on the eve of World War II, there were just 17 democracies. It was not until 1998 -- just two decades ago -- that there were more democracies than autocracies.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, 4 out of 5 live in China.)
The unprecedented expansion of liberty has produced unprecedented prosperity. Last September, the Brookings Institution reported that "for the first time since agriculture-based civilization began 10,000 years ago, the majority of humankind ... some 3.8 billion people, live in households with enough discretionary expenditure to be considered 'middle class' or 'rich.' "
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by the U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. And today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the lightbulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity. There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity.
The men and women who flew those fighters and bombers over the National Mall last week make it all possible. They provide the critical foundation of peace and security upon which our freedom, and the freedom of all the world's democracies, is built. Maybe Luxembourg scores better on some measures, but no one is counting on Luxembourg to secure the peace of the world. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty.
That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – California Rep. Eric Swalwell went after former Vice President Joe Biden – the current frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary – for his age during the Democratic primary debate in Miami on Thursday, saying it was time for Biden to "pass the torch to a new generation of Americans," and claiming that Biden had made that same argument in 1987 during his first run for the White House.
"I was six-years-old when a presidential candidate came to the California Democratic Convention and said, 'It's time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans. ' That candidate was then-Sen. Joe Biden," Swalwell said. "Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans 32 years ago. He's still right today.
"If we're going to solve the issues of automation, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch. "
Biden responded that he is "still holding onto that torch. "
Analysis: Biden's image as the inevitable nominee, the one to beat Trump, was dinged Thursday
More: Bernie Sanders claims 'ageism' after Eric Swalwell attacked him and Joe Biden in Democratic debate
But Swalwell's take of what Biden said when he was 6 was not entirely accurate.
As a clip of Biden's remarks shared by Swalwell on Twitter shows, Biden was actually quoting from President John Kennedy's inaugural address on Jan. 20, 1961. And it appears he was citing the president's words more for nostalgia and the feeling they gave him as a young man, rather than using them to call for his older contemporaries to make way.
Biden's exact words were, "It sounds corny, but remember how you used to feel? Remember how you felt when you heard, 'Let the word go forth from this time and place' that 'the torch has been passed,' passed 'to a new generation of Americans'?" Biden asked the crowd at the California Democratic Convention in a speech delivered on Feb. 3, 1987, according to C-SPAN.
He went on to quote Martin Luther King Jr. , asking, "Remember how you felt when you heard the man say, 'I have a dream' that one day the son of the slave and the son of the slaveholder will sit down 'at the table of brotherhood'?"
Swalwell also claimed that Biden delivered the remarks as a presidential candidate, but Biden did not enter the 1988 Democratic primary race until June 1987, more than four months after the speech Swalwell cited.
Swalwell spokesman Josh Richman referred USA TODAY to a New York Times article that said Biden had long considered a presidential run and was testing out his presidential message by February 1987. But the same article said Biden continued to wrestle with the decision about whether or not to run right up until the eve of his announcement.
Though Biden concluded his speech aimed at his fellow Baby Boomers by saying "our time has come," the context of the speech was not about calling for older Democrats to stand aside, but rather for his generation to overcome political apathy and reclaim the spirit that drove their activism in the 1960s and '70s.
"Just because our heroes were murdered, does not mean that the dream does not still live very deep in the broken hearts of tens of thousands of Americans. For I can still hear those dreamers, and so can you, speaking to us from across the divide of those wilderness years," Biden said in the speech.
"Rep. Swalwell is aware that Biden was quoting another in that moment," Richman said. "But it seemed clear that he was trying to 'evoke nostalgia about 1960s idealism' because he shared that idealism and believed it still applied. "
Biden was addressing what was a common theme in the 1980s, reflected in popular culture by films like "The Big Chill," that the hippies and yippies of the 1960s had "sold out" and exchanged idealism for materialism in 1980s America.
"The cynics believe that my generation has forgotten. They believe that the idealism and compassion and conviction that changed the world, that marked our youth, is now nothing but a long, faded whisp of adolescence. They believe that having reached the conservative age of mortgage payments, pediatricians' bills and concern for our children's education, that we have forgotten," he said.
"But I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that they have misjudged us. "

U.S. is exceptional regardless of what Democrats say

Texto completo: Two foreign observers deserve credit for coining the notion of American exceptionalism. It was Alexis de Tocqueville, in his book "Democracy in America," which remains the greatest examination of American government ever written, who first connected the idea.
"The position of the Americans," he wrote, "is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one."
It is easy to think that this was always the standard, but in 1831 when the first volume of the book was released, the American model remained quite abnormal. It would be another 100 years before the growth of democracy really began on a global scale.
What for him was a defining American characteristic was for Karl Marx, decades later, a source of confusion. America was an industrial nation with the supposed prerequisites for communism, yet it never developed a class system or seriously entertained a proletariat uprising. This, he reasoned, could only be temporary. The United States might be an exception now, he reasoned, but as the population grew, land became less abundant and more time passed, it too would bend toward communism.
Tocqueville was right, and Marx was wrong. America's conditions never led to a communist revolution, yet Europe and the rest of the world did grow more democratic. Thinking more in line with Tocqueville's view, that America is not merely an exception but that it is exceptional, took root and has long been central to the national identity.
There is an evident effort by the postmodern left to change that today though; to not just to reduce the notion of American exceptionalism but American history as a whole to nothing more than a vile unsalvageable blip.
A combination of this influence and the omnipresent fear of angering the "woke left," ready at their keyboards to unleash social media rage, has encouraged many Democratic politicians to refrain from patriotic gestures, or worse, to seek a pathway by undermining America's achievements.
Recently, New York Times columnist Bari Weiss raised frustration with the reservation of Democratic presidential candidates to appear patriotic. They are "scared to touch" patriotism, she said. "They are scared to touch anything that will give them the whiff of xenophobia and bigotry and all the rest of the things that they are terrified of being accused of. And they need to come up with sensible answers to those things."
This is most plainly understood as a rejection of American exceptionalism and one that has infected parts of the Democratic base. A Gallup poll this year, conducted annually near Independence Day, found that only 22% of Democrats are "extremely proud" to be American, a 10-point decrease since last year and a 34-point decline since just 2013.
There is any number of statistics that could demonstrate the contrast, displaying that America remains an exceptional nation, from donations to charity, to work ethic, to religiosity, to the nations that still look to us for inspiration. But, it is even more so what the most liberal of critics willfully ignore. America is not exceptional because it is perfect, it is exceptional because it measures itself against, and strives for, perfection. We retain the greatest structure of self-government ever created and a people who strive constantly toward a more perfect union.

In politics, Trump is a lucky man

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past." He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court. The debates in Miami showed that’s exactly where the party is headed. On a range of issues from immigration and health care to tax rates and climate change, the loudest voices espoused policies far outside the American mainstream. Rick Tyler, a conservative Republican strategist, accurately summed up the main lesson coming out of the Democratic debates for The Washington Post: "They are not talking to the blue-collar workers that I understand that vote in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Are they seriously capable of choosing a nominee who is going to beat Donald Trump? Right now I have my doubts." The Wall Street Journal editorial page was even pithier when its editors wrote: "President Donald Trump is a lucky man."
Only 26% of Americans call themselves liberals. And their voting power is even less than that, because they tend to cluster in urban areas and coastal states. Trump’s base remains fervently loyal, but stuck at about 35% to 37%. His apparent strategy, maximizing the votes of his loyal followers while not reaching beyond his core support, makes little sense. But the Democrats seem determined to make the same mistake, rushing to extremes and abandoning the moderate middle. And their liberal base, about 1 in 4 voters, is even smaller than Trump’s tribe of true believers. As James Carville, a key architect of Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory, told The New York Times, "This is an election that Trump can’t win but Democrats can lose."
Democratic voters understand this. By 2 to 1, they told CNN that they prefer a candidate who can defeat Trump, as opposed to someone who shares their views on issues. And 43% still see Biden as their best hope for a victory — 30 points ahead of anybody else. But after Miami, the party faces many questions. Can Biden pull it together and reinvigorate his campaign? Is there another moderate who can effectively take up that banner? If the answer to both questions is no, the party is in deep trouble. And Trump is indeed a lucky man.

Texto completo: Ross Perot, who died Tuesday at age 89, shook up American politics in the 1990s as a third-party candidate in two presidential elections. In Massachusetts, Perot (Obituary, C9) spoke at rallies and other events many times, displaying his wit and pointed speaking style. Here are some highlights:
Boston Common, June 20, 1992: Perot, campaigning for the first time in Boston, appealed to supporters to “stay in the ring, shoulder to shoulder, with me" in his fight against established political powers in Washington. A crowd of several thousand, including a few hecklers, attended the Perot rally after hundreds of his followers trooped past the graves of Revolutionary War patriots on Tremont Street in an afternoon parade. Responding to criticism that he is trying to “buy the election," the wealthy Dallas entrepreneur said, “That's right! I'm trying to do it for the people; they can't afford it." He called for the creation of “more jobs than workers" and a greater sense of unity, and he invoked the motto of Alexandre Dumas's Three Musketeers — “One for all and all for one" — while advocating a spirit of volunteerism. With that approach, he said, “Nobody will beat us anywhere."
UMass Amherst, June 12, 1993 : In a rally to drum up support for his citizens' group United We Stand, Perot denounced the pending trade agreement known as NAFTA, which he said would send thousands of jobs to Mexico. He drew loud cheers when he proposed what he called “a job stimulus package for Congress and foreign lobbyists," saying “we're going to buy each one of them a bus ticket to Mexico and let them go to work for 58 cents an hour." Perot said his supporters were having a major impact in Washington. “Nobody ever talked about the debt and the deficit until you came along," he said. “Boy, did they get the message in Washington. They are like ants on a hot skillet when they think of you."
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, May 16, 1994 : Perot lashed out at President Clinton's health care plan, saying it contained the “ultimate hidden tax on the American consumer in the form of its mandate that employers provide benefits. “We have people in Washington who honestly think money falls out of the sky," Perot spoke to about 700 students, faculty and supporters. “If you increase the price of the product, who buys the product? Ordinary Americans. So who pays the tax? . . . Washington loves to offer us free candy." he said. “But watch my lips: There is no free candy. You will pay for it with interest."
Commencement at Boston University, May 22, 1994 : “We are coming out of the Me Generation and I hope into the We Generation. Our generation has dug a deep hole for you to fill. . . . Be a giver, not a taker. Create opportunities for other people — that's the story of my career."

HOW CAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BE SO SILLY? MANY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRANTS LACK AN APTITUDE FOR TALKING LIKE, AND TO, NORMAL AMERICANS

Texto completo: If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now, she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance.
Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost - if they ever had - an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Ms. Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times - not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign - says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as [Bernie] Sanders," The Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Ms. Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Ms. Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Ms. Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans - 80 million more than voted in 2016 - something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Ms. Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Mr. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions - forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole" and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering - modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Ms. Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Being ‘pear-shaped’ may protect even normal-weight women from heart disease, study suggests

Texto completo: Older women who carry more body fat around their waist than on their legs may be at an increased risk of a heart attack and stroke — even if they are not overweight, according to new research published in the European Heart Journal.
This is not the first study to find that that “apple-shaped” women (those who store fat predominantly around their abdomen) tend to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than “pear-shaped” women (those who store fat predominantly on their hips and thighs).
But those earlier studies mostly focused on women who were overweight or obese. In the current study, all the women had what most experts consider a healthy body mass index (BMI) of between 18.5 and 25.9.
“Our findings suggest that postmenopausal women, despite having normal weight, could have varying risk of cardiovascular disease because of different fat distributions around either their middle or their legs,” said Qibin Qi, the study’s lead author and an associate professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in a released statement.
”In addition to overall body weight control, people may also need to pay attention to their regional body fat, even those who have a healthy body weight and normal BMI,” he added.
Gathering the data
For the study, Qi and his colleagues used data collected from 2,683 American women who had been recruited into a larger, ongoing research project known as the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) in the 1990s, when they were between the ages of 50 and 79. The researchers selected that subset of women from the WHI because they all had a “normal” BMI and no signs of cardiovascular disease when the study began. Each had also undergone DEXA scans to measure the body fat on their abdomen and legs measured.
The women were followed for an average of 18 years, through February 2017. During that period, 291 of them were diagnosed with — or died from — some form of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack.
Qi and his colleagues divided the women into four quartiles based on the percentage of body fat they carried around their abdomens and on their legs. They then calculated how the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared between women in the highest and lowest quartiles for each area of body fat.
Those calculations were done after the researchers adjusted the data for other factors that can influence the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as age, racial and ethnic background, smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity level, family history of heart attack and stroke, and use of statins, aspirin, hormone therapy (for menopause) and other drugs.
Key findings
After crunching all that data, the researchers found the following:
* Women with the highest percentage of fat stored around their abdomen were twice (91 percent) more likely to have developed cardiovascular disease than women with the lowest percentage of abdominal fat.
* Women with the highest percentage of fat stored on their legs were 38 percent less likely to have developed cardiovascular disease than women with the lowest percentage of fat stored on their legs.
* The cardiovascular-disease risk was greatest, however, for women with the lowest percentage of leg fat and the highest percentage of abdominal fat. Their risk of developing cardiovascular disease was more than three times higher than that of women with the highest leg fat and the lowest abdominal fat.
Based on their findings, Qi and his colleagues estimate that if 1,000 women in the study had reduced their abdominal fat from 37 percent to 27 percent but kept their leg fat the same, six fewer cases of cardiovascular disease would have occurred during each year of the study.
They also estimate that if 1,000 women in the study had kept their abdominal fat the same but increased their leg fat from less than 42 percent to more than 49 percent, three fewer cases of cardiovascular disease would have been avoided each year.
Some caveats
The study is observational, so it can’t prove that the location of body fat on the women was responsible for the differences in their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Other factors — ones not adjusted for in the analysis — might also explain the results.
For example, the women in the study with more abdominal fat and less leg fat had higher rates of type 2 diabetes, a medical condition linked with cardiovascular disease. That condition was not adjusted for in the study.
In addition, the study included only women aged 50 or older, and most of them were white. The findings may not be applicable, therefore, to younger women or to women of other racial groups. Nor is it known if the findings are applicable to men.
Lowering the risk
Although this study reveals an interesting link between where body fat is stored and the risk of cardiovascular disease, it doesn’t explain why that link occurs.
Other research may offer some possible explanations, however, as Qi and his co-authors point out in their paper. Scientists have found that when fat is stored in large amounts around the organs in the abdomen, various metabolic problems, including inflammation of the blood vessels, can develop, raising the risk of cardiovascular disease. Researchers have also found that leg fat appears to be linked to a decreased risk of those metabolic problems, although the reason for that association is unclear.
Nor is it clear how women can apply the current study’s findings to their lives.
“Unfortunately, we don’t know how to relocate fat from the belly to the legs. This is influenced by genetics,” Qi told New York Times reporter Nicholas Bakalar.
“Exercise will help with weight loss,” he added, “but we don’t know what kind of exercise would relocate body fat.”
The best protection against cardiovascular disease for women (and men), therefore, continues to be a healthy lifestyle: eat a healthful diet, get plenty of regular exercise, limit (or eliminate) your alcohol consumption, don’t smoke, manage stress and get enough sleep.
And maintain an overall healthy weight.

Prosecutors should stop the scare tactics. Reforming felony murder rule improves our justice system

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Texto completo: I think NBC News did a good job covering the first Democratic debate before the 2020 presidential election.
Not perfect. But certainly worth an A-minus.
The debate — really a forum — was a daunting news assignment. Rounds at 9 p.m. Wednesday, June 26, and Thursday, June 27, each for two hours with 10 attention-craving candidates in front of a live audience in Miami. There were three moderators on stage the first hour and two the second hour.
You could see the debate on NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo, NBC Universal's Spanish-language service. It also was streamed online,
The high point came in the second half of the Thursday session when Sen. Kamala Harris of California challenged the civil-rights record of former Vice President Joe Biden, who was leading all Democratic candidates in the polls.
The low point came in the second half of the Wednesday session when chatter from open microphones backstage interrupted the proceedings out front.
On Thursday, Harris turned to Biden and expressed disappointment that he talked about working cordially with segregationist senators and for opposing federally mandated busing to integrate schools.
Harris' father is from Jamaica, and her mother is from India. In an interview this year with Politico, she said, "I am black, and I am proud of it."
Harris told Biden: "There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me."
NBC News was ready for a moment like this. Moderators Chuck Todd of "Meet the Press," and Rachel Maddow, host of a liberal commentary program on MSNBC, had given Harris 30 seconds to speak. But they let the confrontation continue for about five minutes.
The producers put Harris and Biden on a split screen. Biden listened to her with his head bowed, then offered a stumbling defense.
"Anyway, my time is up," concluded the usually loquacious Biden, who at 76 is considered too old by rivals much younger.
On Wednesday, NBC's technical glitch occurred after the hand-off to moderators Todd and Maddow from Lester Holt of "NBC Nightly News," Savannah Guthrie of "Today" and Jose Diaz-Balart of Telemundo.
Todd was asking Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about gun control when strange voices seemed to come from nowhere. After a period of confusion, Todd abruptly switched to a long commercial break, during which the problem was cleared up.
I remembered the loss of sound during the first presidential debate in 1976 between Republican incumbent Gerald Ford and Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. For almost half an hour, the two stood at their lecterns and sipped water while they were still on camera with no audio.
The ratings for the Miami debate were sensational. Almost 18.1 million viewers watched it live on television Thursday — the biggest audience ever for a Democratic presidential matchup.
About 15.3 million viewers watched Wednesday when fewer familiar candidates were on stage.
"For a large segment of the American public, this was their campaign kickoff," Mark Lukasiewicz, a former producer of presidential debates at NBC and now dean of the School of Communication at Hofstra University, told The New York Times.
The next Democratic debate is scheduled for July 30 and 31 in Detroit. CNN will bring it to us. I hope CNN does as good a job with the second debate as NBC did with the first.

Texto completo: It's not just ordinary citizens who are trying to donate soap and toothbrushes to detainees at federal migrant detention centers.
Following reports of overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, Clean the World, an Orlando, Florida, organization that recycles soap and distributes it to those in need, is maneuvering to make a sizable donation.
CEO Shawn Seipler said he has 500,000 bars of soap waiting to be delivered from Clean the World facilities in Orlando and Las Vegas.
Seipler faces the same obstacle as well-meaning private citizens: the federal Antideficiency Act, which prohibits donations to the U.S. government. But the act allows for exceptions in cases of "emergencies involving the safety of human life," and Seipler believes the current situation meets that standard.
"We can clearly tell you if they don't get these hygiene products there, absolutely there's an emergency involving human life," he said.
Seipler spoke to the Tribune on Tuesday about the surprising powers of a humble household product, the health threats faced by detainees, and his plans for delivering a half-million bars of soap.
"We want to do it thoughtfully; we want to do it properly," he said of the soap donation. "We are literally contacting every member of Congress" for help.
Soap doesn't actually kill germs, unless it's antibacterial, Seipler said. Instead, it uses fats and oils to make the offending microbes slide off your hands.
Hand-washing can reduce the risk of respiratory infections such as flu and pneumonia by 16% percent, and can reduce the death rate by more than 50%, he said.
Clean the World has distributed 50 million bars of soap to 127 countries in the last 10 years, Seipler said. The organization also provides soap to U.S. homeless shelters, relief organizations and women's shelters.
Lawyers who visited a migrant children's detention facility in Clint, Texas, last month reported that toddlers weren't being diapered, and children were going without showers, clean clothes, toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, according to The New York Times.
Government lawyers added to public outrage when they argued that soap and toothbrushes weren't required under the terms of a legal settlement that requires that detention facilities for migrant children must be safe and sanitary.
Last week, a congressional delegation reported on the conditions at a detention facility in El Paso, Texas, according to The Washington Post.
Members of the delegation said they met with more than a dozen women living in a single cell without running water, and that the women reported going weeks without showers.
Seipler said that his organization feels "very compelled" to act.
"From the reporting I am reading, (detainees) are soiling themselves, they are unable to go to the bathroom outside their own clothes.
"If you have a cell that has 100 people in it and any percentage of them have soiled themselves and are unable to clean it, you absolutely have a life-threatening emergency situation."
If flu or pneumonia spread under those conditions and there isn't an immediate medical response, multiple deaths can result, Seipler said.
If he gets the OK from the government, he can start delivering soap within days, he said.
"What a great moment for our country to show humanity and support to those who need it."

Texto completo: I Love You, Now Die:
The Commonwealth
V. Michelle Carter
On HBO July 9 and 10 at 8 p.m.
It was a case that captivated the nation, first with its disquieting details, then with the legal implications of its outcome.
Seventeen-year-old Michelle Carter bombarded her suicidal boyfriend with dozens of texts encouraging him to carry out a plan to take his own life — until he did, flooding his truck with carbon monoxide fumes in a Fairhaven, Mass., parking lot.
Throughout the highly publicized trial that followed, prosecutors successfully cast Carter as a cold-blooded manipulator, who goaded Conrad Roy III into suicide so she could bask in peers' sympathies at school.
But did Carter's part in Roy's death constitute criminal action — as first ruled in 2017 with her involuntary manslaughter conviction, and upheld five months ago in Massachusetts' highest court — or immoral behavior by a troubled young woman?
“Michelle Carter is seen as almost this indefensible character," says director Erin Lee Carr, speaking by phone. “I'm doing the exact inverse of that; I'm creating a defense but also allowing you to see the prosecution."
In her two-part HBO documentary “I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth V. Michelle Carter," airing Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Carr sketches a complex picture of Carter and her toxic, mostly text-based relationship with Roy, imploring audiences to make up their own minds on whether she belongs behind bars. The film's first half focuses on the prosecution's case against Carter, while its second shades in her personal struggles more sympathetically.
In opting for a bench trial, Carter left her fate in the hands of a judge; viewers of Carr's film, the director hopes, can serve as the jury she never had. And with Carter's lawyers expected to appeal her case to the US Supreme Court this month, the film arrives at a critical juncture.
“I love that documentary filmmaking is an additional venue to discuss fraught criminal cases," says Carr, 31. “Sometimes, the court system has an inability to see nuance. This is a possible route to recontextualize and reimagine cases."
All Carr's films dig deep into dark, complicated subjects. Her first, “Thought Crimes," covered the infamous case of the cannibal cop, who fantasized about raping and eating women, while “Mommy Dead and Dearest" probed Gypsy Rose Blanchard's murder of her abusive mother Dee Dee. Her latest HBO doc, “At the Heart of Gold," shone a light on the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, letting victims of now-imprisoned ex-sports doctor Larry Nassar share their stories.
Producer Andrew Rossi, Carr's frequent collaborator, says “I Love You, Now Die" looks intently at whether one person can truly be responsible for another's suicide.
“It was always a question of what kind of legal precedent is being set," he explains by phone. “How comfortable are we as a society with this determination, ultimately, that she was guilty?"
Asked whether she feels justice was served in the case, Carr avoids taking a personal stance. “It's even-handed," she says of the documentary. “For me to answer that shows you my hand." That said, the filmmaker has issues with how media outlets covered Carter and prosecutors framed their case.
“I do feel safe in saying that I believe Michelle Carter was demonized," says Carr. “Here's this pretty girl with eyebrows, who knew what she was doing and killed him to become popular is a good story," she adds. “But is it the actual story? No."
Before investigating, like many others, Carr had been morbidly transfixed by those text messages. “It's now or never." “You just need to do it, Conrad." “No more waiting." And most chillingly, after Roy is alleged to have gotten out of the car in which he was dying: “Get back in."
“It was unlike anything I'd ever seen," says Carr, recalling her “vitriolic" reaction to first reading Carter's texts. “I've seen bullying, and people have said mean things to me, but to see this — a strategic, intense pushing of someone toward an act that will irrevocably change their life and their families' lives — a lot of people would look at that and say, 'She's sick.' "
But Carr suspected there was more to the story and felt compelled to take a closer look. The daughter of David Carr, the late New York Times columnist, she grew up around storytelling, grasping early on the importance of treating interview subjects with compassion. Carr learned harder lessons from her father, too. A complicating force in their relationship was his addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine. In the journalist's 2008 memoir “The Night of the Gun," he interviewed people from his past to confront shaky memories of his life on the street, including the time he put Erin and her twin sister into foster care.
“My dad, through his own admission, did terrible things and grew into somebody respectful, empathic and with humility," explains Carr. “As I approach people seen as indefensible, there's a part of me that really wants to prove otherwise."
Researching the case, Carr soon came to understand it as a tragedy of not one but two young people in free fall, both with severe mental issues, both rapidly uncoupling from reality.
Carter and her family members declined all requests to be interviewed (Roy's family is heavily featured). But Carr and Rossi nonetheless felt they could effectively include Carter's voice by drawing upon tens of thousands of her texts.
“It's a trove as a filmmaker," says Carr.
Staring such darkness and despair in the face has taken a personal toll, Carr admits. “It's hard to think about suicide for four years," she says. “It's not great to melt your brain in."
Carr has projects in the works at HBO and Netflix, though she'll take a breather once her next one wraps in August. “I listen to my therapist," says Carr. She plans to get a dog.
Still, she remains drawn to true crime, in all its stomach-churning detail. “I'm in this little pocket of telling stories about people who did terrible things, but [for whom] maybe there's something else there," she says. “It's something I feel I was put on this Earth to do."

Residents protest migrant detention conditions

Texto completo: "I'm hoping this is the worst it will get. I hope it'll get better. Inmates on death row are getting treated better than this."
Shannon Skally
Staunton resident
Shannon Skally jumped onto the steps leading up to the Augusta County Courthouse walkway on Tuesday afternoon, sign in hand.
"Seeking asylum is not a crime," the sign read. The word "not" was underlined three times, and two American flag stars adorned the piece of poster board.
Skally, 12, held her sign high and waved to cars that drove past the courthouse on Johnson Street. To each person that walked by, she earnestly asked: "Do you want to join us? We've got markers and signs."
"I have an opinion of my own," she said, acknowledging that some people might think she just subscribes to her parents' views. "I know what I'm protesting for."
Skally was one of about 25 people who protested Tuesday outside the courthouse against migrant detention facilities run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The border facilities have been criticized for months for poor living conditions. The New York Times reported that lawyers who visited migrants in late June at a Clint, Texas, Border Patrol facility found children went unclothed and unwashed, crammed into a facility that was over capacity.
Lawmakers who visited that same detention facility on Monday reported equally appalling conditions. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, said migrants were forced to drink water out of a toilet. That assertion was backed up by Reps. Judy Chu and Joaquin Castro, two other Democratic lawmakers who also visited the facility.
Also on Monday, ProPublica published an investigation detailing a secret Facebook group of 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents, who posted derogatory comments and images directed toward migrants and Latina lawmakers. In response, CBP officials said they would launch an investigation into the group.
Tuesday's protest at the Augusta County Courthouse was part of a national day of protests sponsored by Moveon.org to coincide with lawmakers returning back to their districts for the Fourth of July recess.
"I think we need to have as many events as we can," said Stephanie Ward, who organized Staunton's rally.
Ward said she wants 6th District Republican Rep. Ben Cline to visit a border facility and to ensure migrants receive humanitarian aid.
"He represents his constituents," Ward said. "He doesn't represent the president or special interests."
Ward said she encourages people to contact their lawmakers and share their concerns. She had a table set up at the rally for people to write postcards to Cline and Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.
"I understand ICE officers feel overwhelmed and underfunded, but it's not about the money," Ward said. "I'm not buying that they're doing the best they can."
Rally attendees held signs with phrases such as "Child cruelty is not the American way," "End family separation," "Close the camps" and "Children aren't criminals." They also chanted "close the camps now" and "close the camps, reunite families" throughout the afternoon.
Their efforts garnered honks from some drivers who passed by on Johnson Street. Others booed the group. One man yelled "Build the wall!" as he drove past. Some drivers or passersby told the group to go home.
Jennifer Lewis, a Democrat running for the 20th House District Seat against John Avoli, attended the rally with a sign that read, "Keep families together." Lewis previously ran against and lost to Cline in November 2018.
"I think it's just appalling — not just the recent news, but the past two years with the Trump Administration," she said.
Lewis is a mental health worker, and she said that it's damaging to a child's development to be separated from their caregiver.
"Even if they get into the best treatment, that will not repair the damage that's been done," she said.
She wants family separations to stop immediately.
"I encourage everyone to reach out to their elected officials," she said. "Demand that something changes."
Staunton resident Dave Copper said he thinks the "saddest thing" is that children being held in the detention facilities can't go outside and play whenever they want.
"Kids need play," he said.
Skally said she wants migrants to know that there are Americans who support them.
"I'm hoping this is the worst it will get," she said. "I hope it'll get better. Inmates on death row are getting treated better than this."
In a speech at the start of the rally, Ward read the names of six children who have died in Border Patrol's custody.
"Our government's attacks on innocent children in refugee families are causing incalculable damage, and are at odds of our shared values of family and freedom," Ward said. "Children will not be safe until these camps are closed."

Texto completo: Lake County will be able to explore the life of a Midwestern, nature-loving scientist this fall through book discussions, hikes and other events sponsored by the College of Lake County thanks to a $15,000 Big Read Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts.
The grant covers a monthlong series of events from mid-September to mid-October. Activities are centered around "Lab Girl," the award-winning autobiography of Hope Jahren, a Minnesota native who overcame gender stereotypes in science and became one of the world’s leading geobiologists.
Jahren was interested in trees, flowers, plants and soil as a child. "Lab Girl" tells the story of a young woman who finds friendship in odd places, battles bipolar disorder, perseveres through setbacks and becomes a respected scientist and passionate observer of the natural world. Jahren earned a Ph.D. in soil science from the University of California at Berkeley in 1996 and now lives in Oslo, Norway.
In 2016, "Lab Girl" was named a New York Times Notable Book and an Amazon Top 20 Best Book.
"CLC is proud to be one of the recipients of this annual grant for The Big Read from the National Endowment for the Arts, and we hope it will bring our whole community together as the college celebrates its 50th anniversary," CLC President Dr. Lori Suddick said.
"‘Lab Girl’ will appeal to diverse audiences and age groups across Lake County, and its themes represent many of CLC’s priorities, including sustainability and diversity. With our college’s growing STEM program, we seek women as positive examples for our students."
Studies indicate that reading for pleasure reduces stress, heightens empathy, improves students’ test scores, slows the onset of dementia and results in more active and aware citizens. To view a video of Dr. Suddick’s additional comments regarding the Big Read, visit youtu.be/5M9dI8cU1Ro.
The event series will kick off Sept. 18 with a keynote address by Dr. Nancy Tuchman, dean of the School of Environmental Sustainability at Loyola University. Other events include 10 book discussions at CLC and area libraries, a memoir-writing workshop and panel discussions on sustainability, nature therapy and mental health issues.
The Lake County Forest Preserve District, a partner in the project, will offer hikes and workshops on plant identification. Times, dates and locations of these events will be announced later this summer. Lake County is one of 78 participating communities.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — One by one came the flyovers — the Coast Guard helicopters, the brand new F-22 Raptors, the Blue Angels — at President Trump's Fourth of July celebration of the military, an event he orchestrated with tanks on the National Mall, military leaders in attendance, and himself center stage.
“Our nation is stronger today than it was ever before," Trump declared, speaking behind a pane of bulletproof glass that was streaked with rain. “It is its strongest now."
Trump's “Salute to America" was the culmination of his long-held dream of showing off the nation's military hardware — a dream that drew deep concern from his critics about the politicization of the armed forces and some reticence from the defense community.
As the president spoke Thursday in front of the Lincoln Memorial, he stayed uncharacteristically on-script, swapping the partisan barbs and embittered asides that characterize his MAGA rallies for a focused tribute to the branches of the military.
“Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America," Trump said. “It is the epic tale of a great nation, whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true."
He paid tribute to figures in the crowd, such as an astronaut, a nun, and a civil rights activist, and referred to the famous speech that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered right where Trump was standing.
"Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us," Trump said. "For Americans, nothing is impossible.
"In 1963, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood here on these very steps and called on our nation to live out the true meaning of its creed and let freedom ring for every citizen all across our land," he said.
Even if Trump managed to avoid talk of politics, and himself, the spectacle of a president inserting himself so centrally into the nation's Independence Day celebration vaulted a day generally reserved for grilling, flag T-shirts, and feel-good displays of patriotism into America's partisan fracas. The nation's deep political divides were on tense display as spectators descended on the National Mall, with many taking sides for or against Trump.
“I saw how Trump's opponents came out saying all sorts of nonsense: 'Oh, this is what dictators do,' " said David Shoup, 66, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who said the criticism motivated him to drive 660 miles from Dublin, Ga., to park himself on the National Mall. “I thought, I'm going up to support the president."
Around Shoup, hundreds of spectators clad in “Make America Great Again" hats or swathed in clear ponchos over Trump T-shirts lined up near chain-link fencing close to the Lincoln Memorial, where Trump was to speak in front of an area cordoned off for people with special tickets. Some of the VIP tickets were reportedly distributed by the Republican National Committee, much to the consternation of Democrats.
“I think this is Caeser throwing a party for his supporters," said Ed Schudel, 51, a conservative Democrat from Virginia who said the event felt more partisan, more angry than previous celebrations he has attended on the Mall.
The event also highlighted the president's complex relationship with Washington's defense establishment and military leaders. Trump, who never served in uniform, loves the trappings of the military even though he has frustrated his defense advisers with hasty decision-making and wariness of foreign entanglements. Last month, The New York Times reported, Trump ordered a strike on Iran and then called it off at the last minute. He also became the first president to step into North Korea after a meeting with Kim Jong Un arranged almost by tweet.
At one point during his speech on Thursday, Trump bragged the US military had helped to “obliterate the ISIS Caliphate just recently in Syria — 100 percent gone."
Syria has been a particularly controversial issue for the president. Last year, Trump's defense secretary, retired general Jim Mattis, resigned after the president abruptly announced he planned to pull US troops out of Syria.
“He views part of America's strength as coming from rhetoric and coming from showing — perhaps even exaggerating — the size of the stick we're carrying," said Fernando Cutz, who was the senior adviser to Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, Trump's former national security adviser.
“This is a president that actually doesn't want to go to war."
Trump had wanted a military parade since Bastille Day of 2017, when he watched the French President Emanuel Macron glide down the Champs Elysees in a military command car, surrounded by mounted guards.
“We're going to have to try and top it," Trump said at the time. “It was really so well done."
The United States has held numerous military parades over the course of its history, including in 1991 after the end of the Gulf War, and holidays like Veterans Day and Memorial Day frequently use military weaponry and vehicles to honor the troops.
But previous presidents — including Dwight D. Eisenhower — had deep reservations about gratuitous displays of military might.
“He said many times that military force and military power was a tragedy, it was a symbol of failure, it was a waste, and it robbed people of all of the benefits of civilization," said William Hitchcock, a professor of history at the University of Virginia.
After considered pushback from local government all the way up to the Department of Defense, Trump's parade idea was scrapped — but the “Salute to America" was eventually born. With tanks sitting under steady rain in Washington by Thursday evening, it was a far cry from Trump's initial vision.
“The victim is the US military which is in the middle of it, trying desperately to be apolitical and frankly would rather be home grilling burgers with their family than getting used as wallpaper and garden gnomes on a stage," said Peter Feaver, an adviser on the National Security Council's staff during the administration of George W. Bush.
Trump administration officials have refused to say how much taxpayers will pay for the celebration. The Washington Post reported that the National Park Service is diverting almost $2.5 million in fees to cover some of the costs.
On the Mall, even some supporters of Trump, like Victoria Camp, a retired schoolteacher who lives in the Washington area, said disapprovingly that the president had imbued “America's birthday" with politics.
As if to prove her point, she began complaining about Democrats. “If we think we're going to give away free this, free that, cancel your debt, reparations, where is the incentive to do or become anything?" she asked.
Further down the Mall, Meg Haugh lamented the fact that she had had to deflate a balloon depicting Trump as a baby in a diaper in order to get past security for the event — but brightened up when a passing spectator, Carrie Fuhrer, saw her Pete Buttigieg T-shirt and gave her a high-five.
“It's so very scary that someone would be able to do this," Fuhrer said, looking at the people clad in Trump gear around her, and said she was leaving: “We're going back to a real town, with real people."
But Jim Zinni, a Marine veteran and government contractor in a Make America Great Again hat who traveled to the event with his wife from New Bern, N.C., said he deeply appreciated the tribute to his service.
“That's what makes your heart pump, that's what Fourth of July is about," Zinni said. “The military has always kept our country free."

Texto completo: In diplomacy, small steps can lead to big change.

President Trump's few steps onto North Korean territory last week should be appreciated for what they represent, which would be America's improving relationship with one of the world's most insular states, and what they portend, the further reductions in tension on the Korean Peninsula and even a better life for the North Korean people.

Critics have complained that Mr. Trump's various meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un have been little more than showboating. That they've produced no progress in dismantling Mr. Kim's nuclear program yet given Mr. Kim a legitimacy his brutally repressive regime does not deserve.

But dialing back the engagement, or going on the offensive, is hardly a viable alternative. Saber-rattling hasn't improved America's relations with Iran. The tariff chess game hasn't helped U.S. ties to China. Decades of trying to isolate Cuba have produced ... nothing.

Relationships, such as the one Ronald Reagan had with Mikhail Gorbachev and the one that Jimmy Carter had with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, are the key to change.

Mr. Trump has gotten closer to North Korean officials than any other president in history - remarkable considering Mr. Trump's and Mr. Kim's mutual penchant for bellicosity - and he's the first U.S. President to step foot on North Korean soil. Mr. Trump and Kim noted the significance of the moment, which occurred during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone officially separating North Korea and South Korea.

The dictator invited the leader of the free world to step across the border, and the latter obliged. It's the kind of development that pays dividends down the road - maybe not with Kim renouncing his nuclear ambitions, but with wins other kinds.

Clearly, Kim, whose family has been shunned by so many for so long, appreciates the attention paid him by Mr. Trump. The British, Germans, and French certainly aren't courting him, and China, North Korea's one true ally, treats Kim like a wayward brother. Kim will want to keep the good times with Mr. Trump rolling.

Critics have suggested that Mr. Trump's friendliness toward Kim is disrespectful to the family of Otto Warmbier, the Ohio college student arrested during a visit to North Korea in 2016 and returned to the United States just days before his death from unexplained head injuries he suffered in captivity.

At the time of Mr. Warmbier's detention and death, Mr. Trump had no relationship with Kim. Now, the President can use their rapport to defuse future crises. There are signs that the relationship is bearing fruit. As The New York Times noted, Kim has freed some American prisoners, returned the remains of some servicemen missing since the Korean War, put a halt to nuclear tests, paid more attention to his economy, and permitted a black market to operate among his impoverished people.

Overnight change in North Korea is extremely unlikely. But engagement has the potential to alter North Korea incrementally, and that is better.

Book a look at a family tragedy

Texto completo: When my good friend Steve Vogel announced the publication of a new book, I had mixed feelings.
I was confident the book would be compelling and expertly written, just as Steves earlier work, New York Times' bestseller Reasonable Doubt, was. Rather, it was the sorrowful topic that gave me pause.
The Unforgiven is co-authored by Steve and Edith Brady-Lunny, an award-winning journalist who recently retired from The Pantagraph. It is the true story of three children, ages 6, 3 and 23 months, who drowned in a car at Clinton Lake in 2003, a horrifying tragedy which resulted in murder charges against the childrens mother and her then-boyfriend. To this day, both adults say it was a terrible accident.
On a recent Saturday, I picked up the paperback intending to read a few chapters, but instead read the entire book, cover to cover. I couldnt put it down.
As expected, there are elements of this story which are utterly heartbreaking to read. And, I doubt I will soon forget the police descriptions of the drowning scene. But in addition to the telling of the tragedy itself, the book provides intriguing insights beyond the headlines many of us remember.
The Unforgiven: The Untold Story of One Womans Search for Love and Justice reveals the challenges and mindset of Amanda Hamm, the deceased childrens mother. It continues her story with a painful second drama when she gives birth to three more children and in 2014 enters a custody battle against the state of Illinois to keep them.
Released in April, the book has been on Amazon's list of new true crime best-sellers. The narrative is rich in detail and perspective, which is not surprising as Edith is one of a handful of reporters covering this story from the very beginning to today. When she approached Steve about collaborating on a book, he couldnt say no.
At the time, I had research for a different book underway, said Steve. I respected Edith for the quality reporting she provided The Pantagraph as well as her first-hand knowledge of the case, so I wasn't about to pass up this opportunity to work with her.
Pouring over documents, interviewing key people and writing the book was a four-year project. I recently posed a few questions to the two local authors about the experience, reactions to their work and thoughts on forgiveness.
People hearing the story for the first time are numbed by the level of tragedy, said Edith. Then, they become intrigued by how authorities put together the murder cases and, finally, they question whether justice was served for all involved.
Interviews with Amanda and her former boyfriend, Maurice LaGrone, with police, medical workers and others, supplemented details Edith witnessed first-hand.
The interview Steve and I conducted with Amandas defense lawyer Steve Skelton stands out in my mind because of his ability to recall how he made his decisions during her case, said Edith. He has handled multiple trials since 2006, and still remembers how and why he called, or did not call, certain people to testify.
The act of forgiveness in this case can be challenging. Do the two adults, who watched their car sink into Clinton Lake with three panicked children still inside, deserve forgiveness?
I like to refer to the quote by Henry Ward Beecher at the front of the book, said Steve. I can forgive, but I cannot forget is only another way of saying I cannot forgive. We don't tell people what to think in this book. We lay out the facts, the totality of which has never been presented in a single place before. We do write about accountability and forgiveness, a complicated conflict.
Said Edith, From conversations with Amanda and Maurice, I know they are unwavering in their claim that what happened at Clinton Lake was an accident, and they will blame themselves for their failures that fateful night for the rest of their lives.
As for the families, they will always love and cherish the memories of three sweet children.
Edith added, Amanda and Maurice understand they may never be forgiven.

It’s great to be straight, so we don't need Straight Pride

Texto completo: My gaydar started to flash “warning!” when I first heard that a band of straight guys, known as Super Happy Fun America, are planning what they call a “straight pride” parade in Boston this summer. The group’s slogan — "It’s great to be straight” — is certainly catchy, in the same kind of way “Make America Great Again” is.
Indeed, it’s great to be straight — some of my best friends, even my brother — are. And if LGBTQ people can celebrate June as Pride Month with a parade (and parties!) in their honor, why shouldn’t straight people have pride, too?
Organizers are touting the new parade as a celebration of "the diverse history, culture, and contributions of the straight community. ” Amen, my brothers! You wrote the history books, the laws and the religious canons, and you are lionized month in and month out — that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a parade as well.
Super, Happy Fun
Straight pride initially seemed like a bad idea going nowhere fast, but it is now on surer footing. Last month, Boston tentatively approved both a parade route and the permit, although the police department and city licensing board must still give their OK.
Despite promises to be “super happy fun,” I’m remembering the roots of straight pride, a movement launched about 30 years ago by conservative social groups to mock and ridicule gay pride — and people. Its goal has been laser-targeted: to denigrate the entire LGBTQ civil rights movement, which has always focused on equal rights and protections, like being able to keep your job, get married or be allowed into the hospital room when your beloved is dying. How fun is all that?
Even more “fun,” in the weeks since straight pride was first announced, The Guardian has reported on the ties between its organizers and the far-right group Resist Marxism, leading to worries that straight pride might descend into violence. One of the organizers of straight pride, Mark Sahady, participated in an event last year in Portland, Oregon, that was declared a “riot” (and not in the funny, laugh-riot way) by city police. Sahady has also organized similar events for Resist Marxism in Boston. Suddenly, that super fun parade is starting to sound super dangerous, which is probably why Boston’s mayor will wisely be a no show.
John Hugo, who is president of Super Happy Fun America and a Republican who lost a congressional race last year (not that this is a political event) has argued that straight people are an oppressed minority. Reasonable people might disagree on two counts — the oppressed part and the minority part — but that won’t cut into Hugo’s propaganda, oops, I mean fun, catchy slogans.
Comedian Eva Victor nailed all this on Twitter with a satirical video to her boyfriend that details why she’s so excited to go to straight pride. “We have 364 days a year where we have unbelievable, unspoken privilege and then we have one day here — one day — where we get to celebrate having that privilege all year long,” she quips. “What’s not to understand?” she explains to the boyfriend, adding that they can wear swimsuits, ride atop a float and kiss in public. “Kiss me!” she demands, “that’s what (straight pride) is all about. ”
Victor’s message is scalpel-sharp to those of us who have lived with the fear of any public displays of affection, sometimes being arrested for holding hands or kissing in public, sometimes being assaulted or killed. Yes, kissing as a metaphor is central to LGBTQ pride, and when you see jubilant gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender kisses on a Pride float, know that those were hard-earned indeed.
Perhaps the most super happy part of the parade is its grand marshal, Milo Yiannopoulos. The disgraced right-wing pundit lost his job at Breitbart News in 2017 after making light of pedophilia, and was permanently banned from Twitter a year earlier after instigating racist abuse campaigns against an African-American comedian. In May, he was also barred from Facebook for “dangerous” speech. Sure, Yiannopoulos is on top of my invite list for a good time — and a grand marshal.
We’re Here, Not Queer
"I’ve spent my entire career advocating for the rights of America’s most brutally repressed identity — straight people,” Yiannopoulos, who identifies as gay, said in a statement. The parade, he continued, will “celebrate the wonder and the majesty of God’s own heterosexuality. " Although it’s not clear who the “we” are in his statement, he concluded that “it’s great to be straight, and we’re not apologizing for it anymore. We’re Here, Not Queer. ”
A backlash movement that claims to promote or defend the rights of majorities when oppressed minorities rise up is nothing new. Take Black History Month, created to counter the systematic elimination of African Americans from American history. In recent years, efforts have been made to create a White History Month (which a recent survey showed is supported by a small plurality of Trump partisans), ignoring the fact that American history pretty much is white history. History books are filled with tales of our (white) Founding Fathers, and 44 of 45 U. S. presidents have been white men. This does not look like persecution to me; rather it’s animus cloaked in a false argument of equality.
None of this is to say that Super Fun Happy America should be denied its parade in the sun next month. Our dearest freedoms are of free speech and association, so we cannot tamp down expression we find egregious. At the same time, let’s not get distracted by faux festivities that mask an agenda of exclusion, if not hate. I may have turned off my gaydar alarm for now, but I’m not going back to sleep. We all need to be wide awake for this.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, the only Republican in Congress to support impeaching President Trump, said he's leaving the party after attacks from Trump and fellow Republicans.
In a Washington Post op-ed that did not mention Trump by name, Amash wrote: “I've become disenchanted with party politics and frightened by what I see from it. The two-party system­ has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions."
Trump responded with a personal attack, calling Amash him “one of the dumbest and most disloyal men in Congress."
Amash, 39, a libertarian with a contrarian streak, has been one of Trump's staunchest critics on the right; he considered a run against him in the 2020 election. Amash's move makes him the only independent member of the House, which now has 235 Democrats and 197 Republicans.
In May, Amash became the first — and so far the only — Republican in Congress to join Democrats in saying the president had committed offenses that were impeachable, based on his reading of the redacted report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Amash argued it provided multiple examples of conduct that could be labeled obstruction of justice.
The president struck back, calling Amash a “loser."

Biden shows frustration with Harris's criticism
INDEPENDENCE, Iowa — Joe Biden expressed frustration Thursday at Senator Kamala Harris's pointed criticism about his 1970s-era opposition to busing, arguing that Democrats should “be talking about the future." But he resisted the opportunity to return fire at Harris for voicing a position similar to his on school integration.
One day after she said that local school districts should determine whether to bus students, effectively the argument Biden had made in the face of Harris' attack at last week's debate, the former vice president simply said that she was “absolutely right."
As he addressed reporters after jogging through a July 4 parade on a steamy morning in Independence, Iowa, Biden called Harris, who has jumped in the polls since her debate performance, “a good person, smart as she can be."
He also repeatedly made clear that he was irritated at being targeted for positions he had held more than four decades ago.
Biden bridled at the suggestion that he should show contrition for opposing federally mandated busing — he once called the approach “asinine" — during his tenure as a senator from Delaware. “I don't have to atone," he said. “Look, my record stands for itself."
After Harris found success confronting the former vice president on busing, she has appeared uncertain about how to characterize her own views on the matter.
Harris was asked to explain what she meant when she said Wednesday that busing should be part of “the toolbox" to address desegregating schools, which would be distinct from a federal mandate. She suggested that the environment around civil rights is different today from when she was a student, though she said she supported school districts and municipalities doing “whatever they need to do" on integration measures.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THOROUGHBREDS (2018) 8:25 p.m. on HBO. "You ever think about just killing him?" That question is tossed out by Amanda (Olivia Cooke), an emotionally stunted high school student, in reference to her friend Lily's stepfather in this debut from the writer-director Cory Finley. "How ... would you?" Lily (Anya Taylor-Joy) replies, in a muted manner. Amanda and Lily are a pair of erstwhile friends brought back together by circumstance: The studious Lily is enlisted to tutor Amanda, whose troubled nature is bared at the beginning of the movie, when she kills her injured horse with a knife. This film is about their friendship, and their increasingly inability to reign in their darker sides. Though direct summation is difficult: "For all the chatter and intrigue," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, Finley "never settles on a point or theme." But, she wrote, the director "gives the movie a professional sheen and gets fine performances from his actors."
STAR WARS: EPISODE V -- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) 5:15 p.m. on TNT. When this "Star Wars" sequel first hit theaters, Vincent Canby referred to it, in a review for The Times, as "the second film in a projected series that may last longer than the civilization that produced it." Time has yet to quell that possibility -- though this may be the finest installment in the series, routinely topping lists that rank the "Star Wars" movies. It is the entry that introduced Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to Yoda. It froze Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in carbonite and had the famous "I love you"/"I know" exchange between him and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). It also strikes a darker tone than its predecessor, STAR WARS: EPISODE IV -- A NEW HOPE (1977), which airs on TNT directly before, at 2:30 p.m. STAR WARS: EPISODE VI -- RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983) comes after, at 8 p.m.
What's Streaming
WOMAN AT WAR (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A one-woman Monkey Wrench Gang, Halla (Halldora Geirharosdottir) is a middle-aged Icelander who, when not engaged in her profession as a choir director, likes to spend her time sabotaging environmentally-unfriendly construction projects outside Reykjavik. She is the anchor of this drama from the Icelandic filmmaker Benedikt Erlingsson. The movie follows her during a crucial period in her life as an activist and person, when she is after many years approved to adopt a child.
HER SMELL (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The Times's chief movie critics named this latest feature from the writer-director Alex Ross Perry as one of the best films of 2019 so far. Elisabeth Moss personifies 1990s grunge as Becky Something, the front woman of a punk band. The result, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, is "a train wreck in five acts" that explores the question of whether one can separate an artist from their art.

Texto completo: The heavyweight boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Jess Willard on July 4, 1919, drew more than 200 media members from across the United States to Toledo.

Here is a sample of how they chronicled the historic bout that day.

* Blood covered [Dempsey's] body and his arms hung so helplessly over the ropes that it seemed as if a child might give him further abuse without arousing his interest. Dempsey was breathing hard when the fight ended, but it was from exertion and not from punishment. He escaped almost unhurt, but as he had been using his arms like trip hammers on the anatomy of his opponent for nine crowded minutes in a sun that sent the thermometer to 110 degrees, his heart was still pumping at high pressure and he appreciated the breathing spell. - Associated Press

* When the towels flashed through the air Willard's face was a mass of blood, while Dempsey was spattered on his breast and his back with the blood of his opponent. Jess's right eye was completely closed, there was a freely bleeding cut beneath his eye, his mouth was bleeding profusely, six teeth were out, and the whole right side of his face was swollen to almost twice its normal size. Dempsey had not one mark. - The New York Times

* Willard never landed a solid blow on Dempsey throughout the three rounds whereas Dempsey whipped Willard so badly that his face resembled a pounded beefsteak. - Frank G. Genke, Staten Island (N.Y.) Advance

* In autumn, when the green fields and trees discard their summer raiment and assume their golden yellow hues before facing a hard winter, it is a beautiful sight. But in the autumn of life, when a big, strong, able-bodied athlete, in perfect physical condition, put on the yellow shroud, the sight is not impressive. Willard was yellow, despite the punishment he absorbed in the first three rounds. Perhaps he was dazed and didn't know it. - Robert W. Maxwell, Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger

* Fighting with the furry of a bulldog tearing down a mastiff, Jack Dempsey knocked out Jess Willard here in one round. The second round never should have been fought. -… It was the most one-sided fight for a title ever seen in any ring. - Robert Edgren, Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald

* Jack Dempsey proved to be the greatest fighting tornado, in a boxing way, the game has ever known, when in nine minutes of actual combat today, he crushed Jess Willard into a shapeless man of gore and battered flesh. -… If you could imagine a thick hamburger steak, painted blue and purple and crimson, plastered to the side of a man's face, you might get some idea of how Willard looked in the middle of that third round. If a six-inch shell had exploded against his right jaw it could hardly have changed his features more. - Grantland Rice, New York Tribune

* Willard, who towered above his antagonist like a light house over a tug, acted like a sick man. He was beaten and knew it. He swung wildly and feebly while his relentless antagonist pounded home blows like a great riveting machine. There were cries of 'stop it, stop it; it's murder.' - Southeast Missourian

Divulga video violando a adolescente; pero lo exculpan porque es de “buena familia”

Texto completo: Un adolescente de 16 años se filmó mientras agredía sexualmente desde atrás a una joven de su misma edad en el transcurso de una fiesta en Nueva Jersey, Estados Unidos. El abuso con penetración se concretó, además, cuando la víctima se encontraba intoxicada, casi inconsciente en un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la celebración, según las fuentes judiciales.
Luego del aberrante hecho, como si el abuso no fuera suficiente, y según señalaron los investigadores del caso, el joven envió a sus amigos el video junto con la leyenda: “Cuando la primera vez que tuviste relaciones sexuales fue una violación”.
Sin embargo, un juez de la Corte de familia del condado de Monmouth, de Nueva Jersey , llamado James Troiano, solicitó indulgencia para el joven porque “provenía de una buena familia” y que, por las características de su formación, “claramente es un candidato no solo para la universidad, sino para una buena universidad. Sus puntuaciones para ingresar a la universidad fueron muy altas”, aseguró.
La causa y los dichos de Troiano fueron difundidos por el New York Times. El medio estadounidense consigna también que el juez en cuestión, en una audiencia de septiembre de 2017, negó que el acto cometido por el adolescente haya sido una violación, ya que para él solo se considera “violación tradicional” cuando dos o más hombres atacan sexualmente a una mujer a punta de pistola.
Agregó que los fiscales de la causa debieron haber advertido a la víctima de que presentar cargos contra su abusador podría destruir la vida del adolescente. Troiano también cuestionó si el nivel de intoxicación de Mary era tan excesivo como para que no entendiera lo que estaba ocurriendo y no le dio demasiada importancia a los mensajes de texto del acusado porque “los jóvenes dicen muchas estupideces a sus amigos”.
Troinano utilizó todos estos argumentos para negar la moción presentada por los fiscales para que se juzgue al adolescente, como un adulto en un juzgado superior, ya que la ley de Nueva Jersey permite que los menores, a partir de los 15 años, sean juzgados como adultos cuando son acusados de delitos graves.
Pero los argumentos de este juez de 70 años no alcanzaron para evitar que G.M.C. -como fue identificado el imputado- sea tratado como adulto. Troiano fue reprendido severamente por una corte de apelaciones que despejó el camino para que el caso pase de la corte familiar a un tribunal penal de adultos, donde se espera que finalmente se haga justicia.
El caso
El hecho, que llegó esta semana al conocimiento de la opinión púlbica de los Estados Unidos gracias a la decisión de la corte de apelaciones, se remonta a 2017. Siempre según el testimonio de los fiscales del caso, el abuso ocurrió en el contexto de una fiesta en la que había unos 30 adolescentes.
La víctima, identificada como Mary para proteger su identidad, fue llevada, en medio de tropiezos, a un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la fiesta por un grupo de adolescentes. Allí la sentaron en un sofá, le rociaron la cola con un desodorante de ambientes y la golpearon con tanta fuerza que al otro día tenía marcas en sus nalgas, según rezan los documentos judiciales reproducidos por el New York Times.
Entonces fue cuando se produjo el episodio que grabó G.M.C. donde se lo veía a él penetrando a la menor. Luego de esto, el adolescente salió del sótano y Mary fue encontrada en el piso con vómitos. La llevó hasta su casa la madre de un amigo.
A la mañana siguiente, Mary estaba confundida por su ropa desgarrada y los moretones que tenía en su cuerpo, y le dijo a su mamá que tenía miedo de que “hubieran ocurrido episodios sexuales en la fiesta” sin su consentimiento.

Texto completo: FAIRMONT - As Joylette Hylick stood in front of the NASA facility in Fairmont, she said she never would have believed the building would be named after her mother. However, when your mother is Katherine Johnson, anything is possible.
On Tuesday, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials had a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the newly redesignated Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in front of NASA employees, government officials, Johnson's family and members of the public.
Johnson, who was born in White Sulphur Springs, was part of the team that sent men to the moon a half-century ago. She also is one of the three women featured in The New York Times best-selling book, "Hidden Figures, and its accompanying Academy Award-nominated film.
Working as what was known as a "colored computer at the time, Johnson was part of a team of black women who calculated the trajectory of America's first space flight with Alan Shepard's mission in 1961. That team then went on to calculate the trajectory of the first moon landing, on July 20, 1969.
The Fairmont facility was officially renamed on Dec. 11, 2018, after President Donald Trump signed a measure introduced by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., that sought to redesignate the building in her honor. The program ensures that all of NASA's critical safety mission software is safe.
For her daughters, who were in attendance in her honor, this was something special.
"We're channeling her right now because, if she could, she would've been here, said Katherine Moore. "It's just an awesome feeling to know that women like Mom, and there are lots of them, have been recognized for the work - and the quality of the work - [they did], and NASA is the benefitter.
This was not the first time Johnson, 100, had been honored for her work - although the recognition has come only recently.
Last year, Johnson was inducted into the Paul E. Garber First Flight Society Shrine at the Wright Brothers National Memorial. In 2017, the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility was dedicated as part of NASA's Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, where she worked. West Virginia State University, where Johnson attended school as a teen and graduated in 1937, established a scholarship in her name and erected a statue of the mathematician on campus last year.
In 2015, then-President Barack Obama presented Johnson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Moore, the youngest of Johnson's daughters, said she was glad to be able to share the moment with Johnson's grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all those in attendance. Her sister, Hylick, said seeing the building for the first time shocked her.
"When I first came up, it just took my breath away because we just never believed that this could happen [or] would happen, she said, choking back tears. "We're just glad she's here to know about it. And she does, because she's still very alert but not very mobile.
Johnson will be 101 years old on Aug. 26 and, according to Hylick, wants to come back to her home state. Hylick said she hopes that, if her mother is able to come back, she will be able to visit the new building.
Johnson was at an extreme disadvantage in the 1950s and '60s, being both black and a woman, which led her to not earning as much respect as her white counterparts. However, Johnson's daughters said, she loved what she did and that it wasn't even a job for her.
She now is inspiring others to have the same mindset.
"Mom says, Follow your passion, work hard and be prepared whenever the opportunity presents itself,' Hylick said. "It was just doing what she loved to do, and when you do that, she said she never worked a day in her life. That's how much she enjoyed it.
Moore said Johnson would be shocked by the amount of support that was shown to her mother during the ribbon-cutting ceremony. She said she and her sister frequently inform her of all the people who know of her and her legacy at NASA.
"She would be amazed at the level of love that flows to us, and we take it right back, and we tell her, Mom, we did this and this,' and she says, You did? All those people?' and I say, And, they know who you are,' She's just overwhelmed.
Capito, who championed the renaming, said she is pleased that the redesignating is finally official.
"When I learned about Katherine, and I saw the movie and [read] the book and started hearing [about her], I just thought, This is an exceptionally rare gem from our state,' she said. "I thought, How appropriate she spent her whole life working in NASA, and we've got a great NASA facility.' I thought this would be a great thing to name after Katherine, and it worked.
Capito introduced the bill in the Senate nearly a year ago. She said she feels that having Johnson as their inspiration is going to inspire young West Virginians to get involved in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) field.
"Katherine was a pioneer, so I think it always helps to inspire the next generation to know that maybe there's somebody there in front of you that worked the ground, that made the breakthroughs, and that opens it up, the senator said. "We've got Girl Scouts here, we've got robotics teams from all over the state, we've got young people here so excited about the NASA future, and, with Katherine's name at the top, she's not hidden any longer.
Gregory Blaney, Independent Verification and Validation Program director, said this renaming is a life-changing event for the facility and its employees.
"I think it's an indication of the excellent work that our team does that they would even consider naming it after Katherine Johnson, knowing her legacy and what she did. And it's actually based on what she accomplished and how she accomplished it, he said. "Obviously, God gave her a brilliant mind. But she had a great attitude, great work ethic, loved to go to work, never complained, never worried about her barriers, and she just did a great job.
Blaney said Johnson is an example to live by and that her legacy will inspire the program forever.
"Our folks, our engineers, do a fantastic job, he said. "I hope this will inspire them to do even more.
Other speakers at the event included: Fred Gregory, a former astronaut and NASA executive; Jim Bridenstine, NASA administrator; and Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va. All spoke of the significance of Johnson's career.
In correspondence with the event, Johnson's autobiography, Reaching for the Moon, was released in bookstores around the country. The story goes into detail about Johnson's life and career from her own perspective, and her daughters said she wrote it to inspire others.
"When she wrote the book, she said, Don't write it for me, write for them, because I want them to learn something every day,' Moore said. " That's how you grow. And to get up there, you have to grow, you have to dream and you have to do.'

Texto completo: In the rough-and-tumble New York City taxi industry, Anthony J. Medina was an enforcer.
For years, Mr. Medina was the go-to debt collector for banks that lent money to drivers seeking to buy a permit to own a cab. If a driver fell behind on payments, it was Mr. Medina's job to ensure the driver paid up. Sometimes, he temporarily seized the car. Other times, he confronted people on the street. Occasionally, drivers said, he flashed a gun.
On Tuesday, the New York City sheriff's office arrested Mr. Medina outside his home on Staten Island and charged him with impersonating a city marshal, a misdemeanor. He is expected to make separate appearances in courts in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island in September.
"This individual's actions as alleged are nothing short of brutal," said Bill Heinzen, the acting head of the city Taxi and Limousine Commission, which oversees the yellow cab industry. "The city will not tolerate these kinds of illegal and callous actions."
In an interview, Mr. Medina, 50, dismissed any complaints against him as bitterness from delinquent borrowers. He denied ever using a gun.
He said that the drivers' anger was misdirected and that city officials arrested him to deflect attention from their own role in a crisis in the taxi industry that was the subject of an investigation by The New York Times.
"The industry is not messed up because of me," Mr. Medina said. "I'm the scapegoat."
The arrest marked the first criminal charges brought against an industry leader in response to the Times's investigation into the taxi trade. One article published in May described Mr. Medina's methods and reported that when he took a vehicle, he often left a note that said the seizures were "authorized by vehicle apprehension unit."
The notes said the seizures were "for Police Dept./Sheriff/Marshall's Office." Mr. Medina is a private contractor who does not work for a law enforcement agency.
Asked to explain those references to law enforcement, Mr. Medina told The Times in an interview earlier this year that they were not what they appeared.
"That's not saying that the person taking the medallion is an officer," he said at the time. "That paper states that I could bring that into a police station, a sheriff station or whatever."
The Times investigation found that taxi industry leaders spent more than a decade artificially inflating the price of the permit, called a taxi medallion, that allows a driver to own a cab. The price of a medallion rose to $ 1 million in 2014 from $ 200,000 in 2002. During that period, lenders made hundreds of millions of dollars by channeling immigrant drivers into loans they could not afford.
The investigation also found that the city Taxi and Limousine Commission ignored warning signs and exacerbated the problems by choosing to sell medallions and run advertisements claiming the permits were "better than the stock market."
After the financial bubble burst and medallion prices crashed starting in late 2014, more than 950 medallion owners filed for bankruptcy. Thousands more are struggling to survive.
Taxi industry leaders have denied wrongdoing, saying regulators approved their practices. They have blamed the crisis on unforeseen competition from ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft.
The day after the investigation was published, city officials started a 45-day review of the taxi industry. In a statement on Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the arrest was the first step in a series of actions arising out of that review. More will be announced this month, he said.
"This arrest provides some long-awaited justice for medallion owners who were made victim of predatory practices for far too long," he said.
Attorney General Letitia James of New York is also probing the lending practices, while lawmakers at the city and state levels are pursuing legislation.
Mr. Medina was an unusual figure in the taxi industry because he worked for most, if not all, of the lenders. He was well-known in the industry; drivers often spoke of their fear of "Tony."
In interviews with The Times, drivers said Mr. Medina usually seized medallions in the night, either by prying them off cars or by taking the entire vehicle. He often left notes that told borrowers they had to give lenders "relief" to get their medallions back.
In addition to catching up on payments to the lender, drivers said they often had to make an additional down payment -- and also pay Mr. Medina $ 550 for his services. Mr. Medina would accept only cash, and he made borrowers meet him at a park to deliver the money, they said.
On occasion, the drivers said, Mr. Medina confronted borrowers in person. In one incident described to The Times and cited in the city's announcement about the charges, he and another associate allegedly approached a driver in a parked taxi and shouted at him until he got out.
In the interview earlier this year, Mr. Medina insisted he was simply a messenger for the banks.
He said he requested cash because drivers who had defaulted could not be trusted to write good checks, and he said he met at parks because he wanted to hide his identity out of fear he could be targeted by borrowers.
"If I was doing things shady and doing things they're claiming that I'm doing, and pulling guns and doing this and doing that, you think I'd be the go-to guy for 20-plus years?" Mr. Medina said in the interview. "Think about it. My reputation speaks for itself."

Study suggests playing tennis has extra life benefits

Texto completo: With the Wimbledon Championships starting this week, this is the time of year when even casual observers pay attention to tennis.
And for us aficionados who both play and follow the sport, we do more than just follow the goings-on — we revel in them.
But whether you’re a beginner, a serious adult league competitor or a social weekend player (like me), you might not be aware of tennis’ potential life-extending benefits.
In a recent long-term epidemiological study of more than 25,000 people conducted in Denmark and published in September in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, researchers attempted “to evaluate the differential improvements in life expectancy associated with participation in various sports.”
The researchers found, unsurprisingly, that participants who did not exercise at all were far more likely to have died before participants who did engage in regularly physical activity.
The researchers, who made allowances for factors such as participants’ age, family/marital status, education and socioeconomic status, found that solitary endeavors such as cycling added 3.7 years to life expectancy, swimming added 3.4 years and running added 3.2 years.
However, sports in which there was more participant interaction — such as badminton and soccer — added 6.2 years and 4.7 years, respectively.
And the recreational sport that added by far the most life expectancy? Tennis at 9.7 years.
This finding is similar to a 2017 study of 80,000 British men and women that found those who were avid tennis players tended to outlive those who were runners.
While the Denmark study’s researchers noted that “because this is an observational study, it remains uncertain whether this relationship is causal,” they suspect there’s probably a connection.
As one of the study’s co-authors told The New York Times, “We know from other research that social support provides stress mitigation. So being with other people, playing and interacting with them, as you do when you play games that require a partner or a team, probably has unique psychological and physiological effects.”
Considering that social isolation can be as big a morbidity risk factor as obesity or diabetes, it would stand to reason that the benefits of physical activity are likely enhanced when there’s social component attached.
And as a lifelong tennis player, I can attest to the life-affirming, emotionally beneficial aspects of playing the sport socially — especially in middle age.
First, there’s the cultural etiquette that’s ingrained in virtually all tennis players. We reflexively compliment our opponents’ winning shots and encourage our doubles’ partners when their shots go errant.
Likewise, sportsmanship and honesty on line calls are a given (or at least they are with my friends). In fact, we err on the side of giving the benefit of the doubt to our opponent. To behave otherwise would be simply unthinkable.
Playing tennis also requires a level of concentration and engagement that’s not found in other “social” sports such as golf or bowling.
Tracking the flight of the ball, moving into proper position, preparing to hit your next shot, determining your tactics as the point unfolds — these skills all require a player to make innumerable cognitive and neurological decisions every instant.
In other words, your brain gets as much of a workout playing tennis as your body does.
But perhaps what I find most beneficial about playing tennis is that I’m never more “present” than I am when on the court.
I’m not thinking about deadlines.
I’m not thinking about politics.
I’m not thinking errands or bills.
No — I’m simply thinking about making clean, solid contact with that fuzzy yellow Penn.
And on a weekend morning, there’s nothing else I’d rather be doing.

NBA; LAKERS REPORT; Daniels agrees to one-year deal for veteran's minimum

Texto completo: The Lakers reached an agreement with shooting guard Troy Daniels on a one-year deal worth $2.1 million.
Daniels is entering his seventh NBA season as a reserve player and spent the last two seasons with the Phoenix Suns. He averaged 18.3 minutes, 7.9 points and 1.5 rebounds in 130 games with Phoenix.
Because Daniels' deal will be for the veteran's minimum salary, it won't affect the Lakers' salary cap. They currently have about $32 million available in salary-cap space and hope to use that to sign Kawhi Leonard. Should Leonard choose the Lakers, they will have a salary-cap exception to give a player and will have to fill their roster with minimum-salary players.

Currently the Lakers have only two players from last season's roster under contract for next season -- LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma. The rest either will be traded for Anthony Davis on Saturday, when deals can become official, or were on one-year contracts.
While the Lakers reached out to several other free agents, especially guards, this past weekend, they are not able to offer anything other than minimum deals until they have Leonard's answer. Patrick Beverley will return to the Clippers on a three-year deal worth $40 million. Seth Curry is reportedly poised to sign with Dallas. Terrence Ross plans to re-sign with Orlando.
One player the Lakers have contacted is Danny Green, according to a person familiar with their communications. Green, who was traded with Leonard from San Antonio to Toronto last summer, is waiting on Leonard's decision before deciding whether to return to Toronto, according to the New York Times.
Summer league
Miami first-round pick Tyler Herro scored 18 points and Duncan Robinson added 17 as the Heat's summer league team beat the Lakers' 106-79 in the first game of the California Classic in Sacramento.
Trey Mourning, the son of Heat legend Alonzo Mourning, was four for five from the field and scored nine points in his pro debut for the Heat.
Rosco Allen scored 13 for the Lakers.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE HUNGRY 8 p.m. on ESPN. A warning to viewers: think twice before using this documentary as inspiration for your July 4 cookouts. The latest entry in ESPN's "30 for 30" series focuses on the rivalry between the competitive eaters Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut, who was a 23-year-old engineering student from California when he defeated Kobayashi at the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2007. To do that, Chestnut ate 66 hot dogs in 12 minutes. "Like a particularly bloody boxing match, it was disturbing to watch," Ken Belson wrote in The New York Times. Not all will have the stomach for the repeated footage of franks and buns disappearing into the men's gullets like water down a drain, but those who do should enjoy the semi-serious, high-stakes tone this documentary strikes.
METROPOLIS (1927) 8:30 p.m. on TCM. Though Fritz Lang's pioneering dystopian sci-fi movie went on to inspire generations of filmmakers, the reception upon its release was mixed. "It gives in one eddying concentration almost every possible foolishness, cliché, platitude and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general, served up with a sauce of sentimentality that is all its own" H.G. Wells wrote in a ringing non-endorsement for The Times in 1927. Ninety-two years later, it's considered one of the most influential films of the silent era, and its themes of social stratification still sear. TCM is showing it alongside a clear precursor: Georges Méliès's A TRIP TO THE MOON (1902), airing at 8 p.m. on TCM.
TALES 9 p.m. on BET. While this anthology series from the record producer Irv Gotti typically spins tales from well-known rap songs, the second season kicks off by flipping the equation. Its first installment will be built around a new Kanye West song, which will debut as part of the episode.
What's Streaming
PHOENIX (2015) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes or YouTube. Several critics drew comparisons to Hitchcock's "Vertigo" after seeing this drama from the German filmmaker Christian Petzold. Nina Hoss plays a Holocaust survivor who has facial reconstruction surgery after the war because of a wound she sustained at a concentration camp. When she returns to Berlin, she reunites with but is not recognized by her former husband, whom she is told may have been the person who betrayed her to the Nazis. She rekindles their romance under an assumed name. He insists that she impersonate his wife so he can collect her inheritance.
VERTIGO (1958) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The less said, the better when it comes to addressing audiences who have the opportunity to decipher Hitchcock's great San Francisco mystery for the first time. James Stewart stars as a detective opposite Kim Novak, whose precise role is a spoiler. "'Vertigo' is not Hitchcock's best, but rather, with its lush morbidity, somnolent pace, poor box office and relative scarcity of jokes, the Hitchcock film for those who most wish he were French," Tom Shone wrote in The Times in 2016.

Texto completo: Pompeo and envoy given 2 to 3 weeks to start new negotiations
As the TV spectacle of President Trump's first visit to North Korea fades, his top diplomats are left with the same daunting challenge that bedeviled them before: a hostile dictatorship that views its expanding nuclear arsenal as critical to its survival.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his special envoy, Steve Biegun, have been given two to three weeks to start new talks with their North Korean counterparts aimed at making a breakthrough in stalled denuclearization negotiations.
While the disputes remain the same, the administration hopes that the chemistry on display between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Sunday will unlock a spirit of cooperation that has been absent from engagements between North Korean negotiators and U.S. officials below the rank of president.
"The president, by getting together with Chairman Kim today, broke through and was able to get us the opportunity to get back to the negotiating table, which I'm excited about," Pompeo told reporters before flying back to Washington.
But absent a change in the U.S. negotiating position, it is unclear if the connection Trump made with Kim during a brief walk on North Korean soil and a 50-minute meeting Sunday will bridge the wide chasm between Washington and Pyongyang.
Pompeo told reporters Sunday that economic sanctions will stay in place, setting aside a key demand by North Korean officials that the United States provide at least partial relief in parallel with their steps to denuclearize.
Biegun also pushed back against the idea that the United States has altered its previous demands, saying in a statement, "We are not preparing any new proposals currently."
Experts say U.S. officials should focus on reaching a shared understanding with North Korea of what denuclearization would look like and getting a better assessment of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons inventory.
"This starts to look real when they get a veritable declaration of all weapons and facilities from the North. That declaration could come in pieces, but it has to happen," said Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Critics of the Trump administration's negotiations say the president is misreading Kim, who has shown no desire to abandon his nuclear and missile arsenal.
"Despite two U.S.-North Korean summits and repeated efforts at engagement, there is still not even an agreed-upon definition of 'denuclearization,' " said Bruce Klingner, a North Korea expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
But others offered cautious praise for Trump's approach.
"I'm not opposed to this," Mintaro Oba, a former State Department official, said in a statement. "Offering a purely optical meeting to Kim Jong Un, without raising expectations for specific deliverables, helps reinforce a narrative of the United States acting in good faith to advance diplomacy. And it may expand Kim's domestic space to engage."
One variable that is expected to change in the Trump administration's favor is the leader of North Korea's negotiating team. Pompeo said Sunday that the North Korean Foreign Ministry would be leading the talks for the country. "I don't know exactly who from the Foreign Ministry, but it's likely to be one of a couple people," he said.
One potential counterpart for Biegun is North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, a seasoned diplomat with years of experience working with American officials on denuclearization issues. Previously, when the Foreign Ministry was sidelined from the talks, Kim entrusted the negotiations to his former spy chief, Kim Yong Chol, a longtime hawk who came off as inscrutable and arrogant during meetings with Pompeo and his aides, U.S. officials said.
While fresh blood could help the negotiations, the United States and North Korea have thus far proved unable to advance the talks outside of meetings between Trump and Kim.
"This is the first time there have been real working-level negotiations that weren't part of a summit," said Joel Wit, a nonproliferation expert at the Stimson Center.
The Trump administration has adamantly denied that it is loosening its demands on North Korea, in particular its stance that economic sanctions will stay in place until the country fully denuclearizes, raising questions about how it will move discussions forward.
On Monday, Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, decried a report in the New York Times suggesting that the administration is pursuing an interim deal that would accept the North as a nuclear power and exchange a freeze on nuclear development for partial sanctions relief.
"Neither the [National Security Council] staff nor I have discussed or heard of any desire to 'settle for a nuclear freeze by NK,' " he tweeted. "This was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the President. There should be consequences."
Bolton was noticeably absent from the historic meeting between Trump and Kim on Sunday as he flew that day to Mongolia. During the Hanoi summit in February, Trump prevented Bolton from attending a high-level dinner over concerns he could hurt the mood of the talks. Bolton has tangled with Biegun in the past over negotiating strategy.
Biegun has appeared to be more amenable to providing concessions to North Korea in exchange for significant steps toward denuclearization, an approach some have called "action for action."
On Friday, Biegun told his South Korean counterpart, Lee Do-hoon, that the Trump administration was seeking "simultaneous, parallel" progress with North Korea in implementing an agreement that Trump and Kim reached in their summit last year in Singapore. In contrast, Bolton has pushed Trump to pursue an all-or-nothing approach that would require North Korea to give up its entire arsenal in one agreement in exchange for full sanctions relief, a proposal Pyongyang has long rejected.
In the absence of a new negotiating strategy, it's unclear if even a modest breakthrough will occur. But with the next talks set to take place before August, the two sides will be put to the test soon.
"The only thing new on this iteration of diplomacy is the bromance," Cha said. "We have lifted sanctions before to no effect. But Trump is trying to gain Kim's trust."

Texto completo: One week after the New York Times showed an uglier side of Minnesota via some racist hot takes on the resettlement of Somali refugees in St. Cloud (“These people aren’t coming from Norway”), which the St. Cloud Times’ editorial board righteously refuted, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz stood on a stage on West Lake Street in south Minneapolis and, in front of a thousand or so Somalis and Somali-Americans, proclaimed, “Minnesota is now the home of the largest Somali population outside of Somalia.”
Cheers erupted and hundreds of Somali flags cut through the humid Minnesota night, waving wildly as Walz read from his proclamation celebrating Somalia Independence Day and Week. Observed annually in Somalia on July 1, the date celebrates the unification of the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somalia) and the State of Somalia (the former British Somaliland) on July 1, 1960, which formed the Somali Republic.
“They emigrated from Somalia to Minnesota, bringing culture, bringing a work ethic, bringing music, bringing a [vision] to America that is something that we value here in Minnesota,” said Walz. “Minnesota is proud to [be part of] the larger Somali community, which has contributed greatly to the cultural proper and demographic landscape of our state through art, through business, through education, through social services and academic excellence.”
Presented by the Somali youth organization Ka Joog, Saturday’s Somali Independence Day Festival is the largest of its kind in North America, and kicked off a week’s worth of events. MinnPost took in the festival, in interviews and photos:
“I’m here because I love Somalia and because I love America,” said Kadar Muse, waving the Somali flag as Gov. Tim Walz spoke at the Somali Independence Day festival on West Lake Street in Minneapolis Saturday evening.
Khalil Mohamud: “I’m celebrating Somalia Independence Day [by] selling Somali flags from my store… It feels good to walk around with the flag; Somali Independence Day celebrates when the Somalis took their freedom from Italy. They used to be colonized by Italy, but when Italy go out from the country, we put out this flag and removed the other flag.”
Zamzam Ali: “I am community outreach worker for Hennepin Health Insurance, helping people to learn, and to connect, and to know about Somali culture and organizations. It is very important to us to celebrate Somali Independence Day, because we are here in America, but the younger kids need to know about Somali history.”
Mohamed Farah, executive director of the Somali Independence Day celebration: “The event has been going on for ten years. The theme is education and building community ties, so it’s building connections and trust within the community, but also between the Somali community and the general public. This is the largest Somalia gathering that happens every year, and the largest in the United States. It’s a really multicultural event to build that connection and trust. There’s enough fear in the world.
“Somali Independence Day is part of Somali week. [Sunday] we’re going to Fargo-Moorhead and doing an event there, and on Tuesday we’re going to have a young professionals network in St. Paul. In Moorhead, we’re showing a documentary called ‘Somalia: A Nation of Poets,’ which shows how art has been used in Somalia and how it is used today. The event is called ‘Xasuuso 1960,’ or ‘Remember 1960.’ 1960 is when Somalia took its independence, so not only are we talking about Somalia’s independence, but also about the relationship between Somalia and the United States dating back to 1960 to 2019, because one of the biggest supporters of Somalia on the global stage has been the United States.”
Governor Tim Walz read from his Somali Independence Day proclamation Saturday in south Minneapolis.
Somalis and Somali-Americans celebrated in south Minneapolis Saturday.
Ubah Keynan with (seated) her husband Ahmed and children Ilyas and Yasmin: “We’re with the Minneapolis Public Schools booth. Somali Independence Day teaches our kids our heritage and even though we’re not in Somalia, we just feel like it’s important to celebrate the music, the culture, the food, and have that proud moment of Independence Day. Every year we wear the flag, and we do anything to show we’re celebrating.”
Somali flags were the décor of choice for many Somali Independence Day festival attendees.
D.H. Ulusow and Hamsa Hussen. “I’m Somali, and I’m American, so this week we get to celebrate both,” said Ulusow. “I’m so happy to celebrate both America independence on July 4 and Somalia independence on July 1.”
Suwlis Siyad: “I love the flag, it makes me happy, it makes me speak for my country today. Today, Somalia is speaking to the world. Somalia is beautiful. It’s coming back. We need to tell the kids about Somalia, because in Somalia they don’t celebrate that much. But every July 1st is a day to remember and a day to hold tight about back home.”
Minneapolis Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs director Michelle Rivero (seated) helmed the OIRA booth.
Abdul Mohmead: “I am one of the planning directors of the event. It’s a great opportunity to break barriers, promote diversity and inclusion, and really get the community out to experience culture and tradition and celebrate each other. Somalis have been here for decades now. This is a place they call home, but also it’s good to remember where you came from. It makes where you are currently more valuable, in a sense.”
Osman Ali Mohamed: “This is a nomad hut from the Somali Museum of Minnesota.
“The dancers perform a traditional dance around and in it, and we have poets and songs from the traditional Somali farmer side. I’m the founder and executive director of the Somali Museum, which has many artifacts to see, and is the only Somali museum outside of Somalia. Nowhere else in the world is there a museum of our size, and we do events, and teach weaving, and dances, and traveling exhibits that go all around Minnesota and outside Minnesota.”

Paid paternity leave offered by more companies

Texto completo: When Nashville data engineer Taylor Murphy and his wife welcomed their now 1-year-old son, Owen, last year, Murphy was offered 12 weeks of paid leave from his Silicon Valley employer GitLab. He took less than two.
Among his reasons: He was six months into his job, he had recently received a promotion, he had just hired two new employees, and he wanted to be available as they started.
When he told his new hires about taking a short leave, he advised them to do it differently — if or when they become parents.
"I said, 'Look, I know I am setting a bad example. I would encourage you to take more time,' " Murphy said. "If we have another child, I do plan on taking more time."
Paid parental leave for fathers is increasing nationally, with 29% of employers offering paid paternity leave in 2018, up from 12% in 2014. But many new fathers are reticent to take advantage of their employers' more generous policies, according to 2017 and 2018 SHRM Employee Benefits reports. Just more than one-third of male employees took all of their paid leave, half the rate of female employees; 40% of male employees used less than half of their available paid leave.
"There is pressure for men not to take paternity leave, even if a company has it written down in policy," said Elizabeth Gedmark of A Better Balance advocacy organization in Nashville. "If it's not something that upper management is encouraging, or if a man perceives that he is going to have any kind of career sacrifices, then often he won't take advantage of it."
For some men, they feel there is a stigma attached to taking a leave, evidenced by a stray comment made by a manager, Gedmark said. Or, if they don't see other men or secondary caregivers, especially managers, taking time off, they may be more reticent to take time away. Sometimes, it is a matter of timing — if they are in the middle of a big project, they might feel like taking time off is not feasible.
"Parental leave is taken after a very senior, high-profile male has taken it and it's been perceived they took it without consequence," said Jaime Klein, founder of Inspire Human Resources in New York. "The first male who is senior that either adopts or has a child has to take the leave. Once they do, the junior males will feel it is not as scary."
'We want you to have this time with your child and your spouse' Access to help from fathers after a child's birth boosted mothers' postpartum health, according to a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, reported on by The New York Times. An Institute for Women's Policy Research 2014 report found leave for fathers can lead to greater involvement with raising children beyond the leave period. It can also lead to greater gender equity at work by alleviating any penalties for women taking time off after a child's birth.
"When men start taking the leave, too, the stigma of taking that leave is removed for everyone, including women," said Christy Tosh Crider, who leads Baker Donelson's health care litigation group in the law firm's Nashville office.
Crider pushed to expand the law firm's parental leave policy in 2015 by adding three weeks of paid leave for secondary caregivers and by expanding paid leave to 16 weeks from 12 weeks for primary caregivers. The firm also added flexibility on when parents can choose to take their leave, allowing them to break it up instead of taking it all at once. Baker Donelson attorneys, primary and non-primary caregivers, are taking advantage, she said.
To make the new policy successful, the firm trained parental leave advisers — men and women — in each of the firm's offices to encourage use of and explain the policy to expectant parents. Crider also offered several sessions on the policy to practice group chairs and managing shareholders, educating them on the importance of encouraging the policy and showing them how client services would not be interrupted.
"Our leaders became big proponents of the policy," Crider said. "Some of them would pick up the phone for a non-primary caregiver who they knew had a spouse expecting and say, 'I expect you to take this leave. We offer it because we want you to have this time with your child and your spouse.'"
The policy change was business driven, as Crider explained to partners wondering how it would affect the firm financially and impact clients. Better policies would lead to greater loyalty and retention, which would improve client services. Lower turnover reduces costs. Offering and encouraging paid leave for secondary caregivers would also help achieve Baker Donelson's goal of making the firm a place where everyone who is motivated can succeed.
Crider said the flexibility aspect has been key to participation. If secondary caregivers choose to work some during the first three weeks of their child's life, they can use that time later — to take a child to a doctor's visit or stay home as their spouse transitions back to work.
Long-term benefits Similarly, Eventbrite offers flexibility on when new parents, both primary and secondary caregivers, access its 18-week paid leave policy. Company-wide, secondary caregivers have used between two and 18 weeks of leave. In Nashville, they have been more likely to use most of the time, but they tend to break it up — either into monthlong stretches or they have chosen to take off one day a week, said Erin Tomlinson, general manager of Eventbrite's Nashville office. Those who have adopted have used the time to travel to go get their children.
"People are very open to the benefit," Tomlinson said. "In the end, when you support your employees and they feel like they truly can have a work-life balance, they will be more productive and more happy and you will have less attrition. The immediate cost might seem high, but you have to look out across the long term."
Jerel Robinson, an Eventbrite senior manager of international sales in Nashville, said he was at first skeptical he would need so much time off, but he decided to embrace the opportunity after speaking with company leaders. He took a month off work when his son, Kyler, was born in October. He woke with him in the night, changed diapers, prepped bottles and picked out dad-themed onesies. He took another month off when he and his wife began training their son to sleep through the night and touring day cares, and he expects to take the remaining weeks in the next few months.
"My dad has been very involved with my life every step of the way. I want to be the same type of dad for my son," Robinson said.
"If I wasn't there to take the time off and be there with my family and my wife, I would have missed so much."
A critical time for bonding Jacob Brown, a human resources business partner at Mars Petcare in Franklin, described his six weeks of paid leave as critical to bonding with his now 2-year-old son. He had been apprehensive about becoming a father and described his early efforts as "robotic" or "clinical," more following the correct steps of care.
It wasn't until the fourth or fifth week that he felt like he experienced the joys of fatherhood and appreciated the closeness he felt with this new presence in his life.
"There was this weird shift, intrinsically, where I was able to connect with him, find some joy and happiness," he said. "In week six, it was a full 180 from where I was before the birth. Without that time at home to support each other and get to know the child and connect differently, I don't know how long it would have taken me to get there."
Brown said he felt only encouragement from the top down, from women and men, to take the whole leave, and seeing others take full advantage influenced his own decision, he said.
For Mars, the benefits outweigh any business costs associated with six weeks of leave.
"We believe strongly that engaged associates, associates who have the opportunity to have a balance and flexibility within work and life, tend to be associates who are happier," said Dave Bradey, Mars' vice president of people and organizations. "They give more."

Men offering to buy kids to enter U.S., officials say; Tijuana shelters warn of migrants wanting to pose as families to make crossing easier.

Texto completo: Some migrants are trying to purchase children from vulnerable single mothers in shelters so they can more easily cross into the United States, according to shelter directors, migrants and law enforcement authorities.
Migrants in Tijuana shelters said they are alarmed by reports of single mothers being approached by groups of men who have offered to buy children to improve their chances of safely crossing into the United States.
A decades-old legal document, known as the Flores agreement, says migrant children should only be held briefly in U.S. border custody, which often means they are released, along with the parent or guardian with whom they crossed while they wait for their asylum cases to make their way through clogged immigration courts.

Typically when migrants are apprehended at the border with their children they are held in custody for a few days before they are released. Single adults who cross the border can face months in detention.
U.S. border authorities have been warning since June 2018 about people fraudulently using children who aren't theirs to pose as family units and gain entry into the United States, a claim that critics said was overblown.
But now, authorities in Tijuana are warning migrant mothers to keep their children close by and supervised.
"I can't go to work because I can't take my eyes off my boys," said Antonia Portillo Cruz, a 44-year-old migrant from Honduras, who said the men have been targeting the shelter where she stays.
She said she witnessed some of the men asking women in the shelter about purchasing their children, but none of them made the offer directly to her.
Portillo said the groups of men have been approaching the Iglesia Embajadores de Jesus shelter and offering about 7,000 pesos, or $350, to purchase a child to cross into the United States.
She said she fears the requests and the offers of money will turn into demands or kidnappings. Portillo said she never lets her two boys, aged 10 and 8, out of her sight.
"They want to rob our kids so they can cross into the United States," she said angrily.
A spokesman for the Tijuana municipal police confirmed the reports and said federal authorities are investigating. The case was first reported by Tijuana journalists Yolanda Morales and Yuriria Sierra for Imagen TV.
Pastor Gustavo Banda, a Tijuana shelter director, said families are terrified and feel forced to keep all their children locked inside at all times.
"These are cases of desperation," said Banda, a pastor who runs the Embajadores shelter. "Of course, the women have not accepted any of these offers, but clearly this is a huge concern because of the danger to the children."
Banda now keeps a chain lock around the fence to his shelter and said staff does not let the children outdoors unsupervised.
He said some men, whom he believes are from Haiti or Central America, are also offering money to single mothers to pair up as a fake family unit and cross together.
It is unclear whether the men approaching the shelter are trying to use the children for their own passage or for others who wish to cross.
"Right now, the entire border of Tijuana is practically closed for the migrants, even those from Haiti," he said.
A 15-year-old from Haiti said she was afraid to give her name because she witnessed the men approaching the shelter asking for children to buy.
"It's horrific," she said. "I could not even imagine the horror before I came here. I just wonder what happens to the kids once they make it across. It's not like their mom or dad who will care for them no matter what."
Banda emphasized that none of the mothers sheltered at his church have sold their babies. He said that as soon as he heard of the threat several weeks ago he called the police, who have been monitoring the shelter every day, sometimes visiting three times a day, to try to identify suspects.
In June 2018, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen faced criticism for justifying family separations at the border by warning about adults falsely identifying themselves as parents of children they were traveling with across the border.
"I'm sad to say that from October 2017 to this February, we have seen a staggering 315% increase in illegal aliens fraudulently using children to pose as family units to gain entry into this country," said Nielsen to the National Sheriffs' Assn. in June 2018.
Though the figure she gave was correct, the New York Times noted that instances of family fraud were only a small percentage of the overall number of families apprehended at the southwest U.S. border.
There were 46 cases of family fraud in fiscal year 2017 compared with 600 cases in fiscal year 2018, which ended in September 2018, Department of Homeland Security data show.
Those cases make up less than 1% of the total families apprehended at the border.
Banda said the trend was born out of unimaginable suffering and stems from recent changes in immigration policy that he called "inhumane U.S. border policies."
"Whether they are bad people or not, I don't know, but they are looking for ways to cross the border and end their suffering," he said.
Banda said the shelter is taking security precautions such as keeping all the children in the back of the shelter or keeping them with their fathers as much as possible.
"The mothers are very scared for their safety and for the safety of their children," he said.
At the Agape Mission shelter in south Tijuana, Pastor Albert Rivera said he has been alerting authorities to criminal groups looking for unaccompanied minors.
He said the criminals offer money to the immigrant minors to pair up with an adult so both can cross into the United States as a family unit.
"One of the problems is the state government of Baja California has no system to monitor these unaccompanied kids, so they have no idea how many are here and would have no idea if some were missing," Rivera said.
Mexico Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said last month the federal government is working with the United Nations Children's Fund to develop protocols for caring for unaccompanied migrant children and adolescents in migrant shelters.
"This is heartbreaking, but the situation we are living is causing some to use unaccompanied minors to get to the United States and then they either leave them there or return them," Ebrard said June 12. "It's all a very complex thing that we are reviewing."
In May, Homeland Security officials announced they would start a pilot program to test the DNA of adults and children arriving together at the U.S. border to weed out those posing as families and "rescue children from dangerous situations."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - Apple will manufacture a new version of its Mac Pro computer in China, shifting production of the only major product the company has assembled in the United States outside the country, a person familiar with the plans said Friday.
The move, reported Friday by The Wall Street Journal, will most likely draw the ire of President Donald Trump, who has pressed Apple to shift more of its manufacturing to the United States amid a continuing trade war with China. The person familiar with Apple's plans was not authorized to discuss them publicly.
Trump, who was scheduled to meet with President Xi Jinping of China on Saturday at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, said during the 2016 campaign, "We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries."
The Mac Pro, a high-end desktop computer that sells for $6,000, accounts for a small portion of Apple's overall sales, but it is a rare example of a U.S. technology company trying to do more manufacturing in the United States.
Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, announced on prime-time television in 2012 that the company would make a Mac computer in the United States, the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers. The top-of-the-line Mac Pro, built in Austin, Texas, would come with the inscription "Assembled in USA," Cook said.
The production of high-tech products is a key element of the trade tensions between the United States and China. The fight has put Apple, in particular, in an awkward position because China is also one of the biggest markets for products like its iPhone.
Apple said in a statement that assembly was just one step in a broad production process that creates jobs in a number of countries. The company said it had worked with manufacturing facilities in 30 states and had spent $60 billion with over 9,000 suppliers across the United States last year.
"Like all of our products, the new Mac Pro is designed and engineered in California and includes components from several countries, including the United States," the statement said. "Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process."
The Mac Pro has been a slow seller, and Apple had not updated it since introducing it in 2013.
In December, Apple announced that it would add up to 15,000 workers in Austin, just miles from the Mac Pro plant. None of the new jobs are expected to be in manufacturing.

At Ore Nell, prayers are answered: Brisket is its claim to fame But for the most part, dishes with a twist outshine Texan classics at the Kittery barbecue spot.

Texto completo: Poll a hundred barbecue enthusiasts - everyone from veteran pitmasters to weekend hobbyists just learning to harness the power of their Big Green Eggs - and you'll hear dozens of strategies for smoking meats. We may never resolve debates over wet vs. dry rubs or wood chips vs. chunks, but there is one (almost) universally acknowledged truth about the art and science of BBQ: Brisket is the most difficult meat to smoke.
Will Myska, chef and owner of Ore Nell's, understands how finicky a brisket can be. Open the smoker too soon, and your meat will never hit the right temperature. Leave it in too long without tenting, and it transforms from prime cut to hockey puck.
To stay on the right path, he and his team hedge their bets whenever they load a heavy slab of beef into the indoor smoker at his Badger's Island restaurant in Kittery. The crew oversees the sluggish process with the assistance of spray bottles filled with apple cider vinegar, miles of porous "peach paper" used to retain the meat's moisture and a rather offbeat gambit - a bespoke Brisket Prayer painted on the wall of the dining room:
"May our bark be crispy, our juices be flowing, and may our smoke ring runneth deep. -Ore Nell 3:22."
"It was just something our chef de cuisine Zac Cardona came up with on our opening night (March 22, 2018), because we were all so nervous, and we want brisket to be our claim to fame," Myska said.
Whether it's the power of prayer, the simple salt-and-pepper rub or the seven hours spent on smoldering local white oak, the brisket ($7 for ¼ lb.) I tasted on a recent visit was precisely as entreated: crisp outside and tender throughout, with a rosy racing stripe of myoglobin to indicate that the smoke had indeed penetrated nearly a half-inch inside the beef.
The patron saint credited in the snippet of pseudo-gospel is Myska's 94-year-old grandmother, Ore Nell. Not only is she the source of inspiration for the restaurant itself, but her Houstonian and Central Texan recipes act as a foundation for much of the menu.
"Most of the sides are hers, and our house BBQ sauce is pretty much her recipe, too. It's from that old style when it was considered sacrilegious to put sauce on your BBQ. Most Texans don't. So the old establishment used to make it thin and bitter to turn you off. We don't do that, but we do use a lot of vinegar and molasses, but we make sure it's never super sweet."
It may not taste like a traditionalist's rebuke, but the house sauce is a bit anemic on everything save for a fantastic, ultra-smoky barbecued tofu sandwich, served simply with house-made pickles and sharp raw onions ($7).
The other table sauce, a fiercely spicy ketchup-based arbol chile concoction, is a much better option, especially on meats that need a jump-start, like the juicy pulled pork ($5.50 for ¼ lb.) and the tangy, yet unforgivably dry, pickle-juice-brined half-chicken ($11.50).
And it is certainly true that some of the restaurant's meats require no sauce at all. Take the all-beef Texas hot links from nearby Maine Meat butchery ($6 each), flavored simply with cayenne and jalapeÃ±os and suffused with oak smoke. Or the double-rubbed pork spare ribs ($7.50 for ¼ rack), trimmed in the blocky St. Louis style - a mixed bag of a dish with superb cumin-and-garlic flavor and a bittersweet bark, but meat as tough as jerky.
Perhaps grandmother Ore Nell's best recipe is her banana pudding ($7), served as a parfait with layers of cool vanilla pudding, crumbled Nilla Wafers and sweetened whipped cream. Myska adds playful touches to the Southern classic with crunchy homemade toffee and planks of torch-caramelized banana that allude to molecular gastronomy techniques he picked up during an apprenticeship long ago at Portsmouth, New Hampshire's The Dunaway.
"For sure, grandma never did that," he said with a laugh. "She definitely never brÃ»lÃ©ed a banana."
Dessert is not the only place where Myska relies on techniques and flavors he acquired working in non-barbecue restaurants. Among the specials, he nods to his time at Massimo's in Portsmouth through his panzanella ($9) - really more of an herby salad with enormous, fried white-bread croutons and an efflorescent layer of snapdragons, pansies and nasturtiums. On this menu, he also includes a half-Southern, half-Mexican jalapeÃ±o cornbread drizzled with arbol chile honey that pays homage to his recent three-year stint as chef de cuisine at Portsmouth's Vida Cantina. Both are among the best items I tasted at Ore Nell's.
So too are Cardona's contribution to the special menu: collard greens ($4/$6) braised with whole grain mustard and tart, savory sauerkraut. "That's a recipe that comes from the time he spent in Duval, Florida," Myska said. "Not everything here is traditional, but that's OK."
Almost to a dish, everything I tasted that had been adapted or borrowed was better than Ore Nell's classic Texan barbecue dishes - with one lone (star) exception: the brisket. One of my guests couldn't get enough of it, and when I asked her opinion, without an ounce of sarcasm, she wiped sauce from her lips, glanced at her plate and declared it "divine."

Whicker: Here’s how Santa Anita and horse racing can be turned around

Texto completo: Where are you, American Pharoah? Zenyatta? California Chrome?
Without a folkloric champion on the premises in November, the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita will undergo the most ominous death watch since the days of Gary Gilmore.
Santa Anita did at least retain the world championship of horse racing Thursday, primarily because there wasn’t a palatable alternative for the Breeders’ except Churchill Downs, which is a killing field of its own.
For the Great Race Place, this is a reprieve. No one can collate the factors behind 30 racing deaths this year, and no one thinks we’ll have a similarly drenching winter anytime soon.
But regulars at Santa Anita don’t feel the magic anymore, for various reasons. Some of the problems are traced to a declining sport, some are Santa Anita-specific.
A few areas:
Government regulation
It would eliminate the state-to-state discrepancies. When the NFL saw there was a problem with the gridiron in Mexico City last year, it quickly moved the Rams-Chiefs game to the Coliseum, at great hassle. There is no such national controlling authority in horse racing.
Instead of relying on one track superintendent, an agency could form a track team that would examine conditions nationally.
Gary Stevens and D. Wayne Lukas come to mind as natural thoroughbred “czars.”
The track
When the rains came, Santa Anita sealed its track. Thus it wound up with a deep track and a hard base. Even the exercise riders found it tiring.
The depth may explain why the shoulder injuries, near the end of the meet, caused fatalities. Again, this was virgin territory in a place where it sometimes doesn’t rain during the entire meet.
Rainy days should bring postponements, painful as that is.
The closing of Hollywood Park puts heavy traffic on Santa Anita. Nothing is more polarizing than the argument over synthetic tracks, which Del Mar and Santa Anita both tried and abandoned.
Belinda Stronach, CEO of the Stronach Group, told the New York Times that Santa Anita will at least consider bringing it back.
“You get pelvises and hind end injuries on synthetic tracks,” trainer Bob Baffert said. “I’ve had as many as 30 horses turned out on synthetics.”
But he agrees with trainer Richard Mandella’s more popular idea, a synthetic training track. That would relieve the pressure on the dirt and mollify concerns about training injuries.
Preparations
After Santa Anita closed the track to reassess the death toll and adjusted its drug and whip protocols, Jim Cassidy, the president of California Thoroughbred Trainers, said he was impressed with its precautions. A trainer should have to prove his horse is ready to race and train.
“I tell the jockeys, the exercise riders, don’t be afraid to tell me there’s a problem,” Baffert said. “I won’t be mad if we have to scratch. More likely I’ll go back and ask myself, ‘What did I miss?’’’
Atmosphere
Trainers generally won’t say it publicly, but they’ve been pressured into running their horses regardless of their condition. The bullying seemed to dwindle after the track dismissed executive P.J. Campo. But the buck must stop with president Tim Ritvo at some point.
The excommunication of trainer Jerry Hollendorfer was a good example. He was suspended on the next-to-last day of the meet. If they bring him back in September, it means Hollendorfer suffered a totally cosmetic, yet damaging, 48-hour slap. If they don’t, they need to explain that, particularly when Hollendorfer will be involved in the Breeders’ Cup at the same track.
The future
Belinda Stronach has been likened to Rachel Phelps of “Major League,” the nefarious owner who tried to sabotage the Indians so she could sell them.
That’s a bit unfair because she did push for reforms, like them or not. She is a friend of PETA but obviously feels horse racing and PETA can co-exist.
Of more concern is the legal demolition derby that envelops the Stronachs in Canada. Frank Stronach, the patriarch, is demanding $500 billion from Belinda and wants to remove her and Stronach Group CEO Alon Ossip from the family trust. She has sued Frank. Her brother and niece have sued her.
She has shown no inclination toward selling Santa Anita, which Frank bought in 1998 for $128 million and is worth, what, four times that today?
“We’ve got the same barns that Seabiscuit had,” Baffert said. “We’ve had the same water trucks for decades.”
One would think an Eli Broad or a Patrick Soon-Shiong or any number of Hollywood types would be interested in buying it and restoring the luster, particularly if it seems likely to become an auto mall.
Nice days at Santa Anita have no equal in this sports market. A deathly Breeders’ Cup might stop those days in their tracks.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — NBA free agent negotiations officially opened up Sunday at 4 p.m. MT with fireworks already exploding in the professional basketball world well before Independence Day.
While the Brooklyn Nets stole the show early on with the signing of superstars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, the Utah Jazz also made another splash as they look to get over the hump by signing Indiana’s Bojan Bogdanovic to a four-year, $73 million deal, per ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Bogdanovic averaged a career-best 18.0 points and 4.1 rebounds last year for the Indiana Pacers while shooting 49.7% from the field and 42.5% from 3 in his sixth season.
The 30-year-old Croatian forward reportedly met with the Jazz on Sunday, according to The Athletic, on the first day of free agency.
A Deseret News source also confirmed that former Jazz floor general Ricky Rubio has agreed to a three-year, $51 million deal in Phoenix. The Athletic’s Shams Charania was the first to break that deal.
Utah now has to decline the team option on veteran big man Derrick Favors, making him an unrestricted free agent. Favors’ $16.9 million salary was set to guarantee on July 6 had the Jazz decided to exercise their team option.
Favors is drawing interest from several other teams in the league at just 27 years old after averaging 11.8 points and 7.4 rebounds on 58.6% shooting, while playing mostly out of position at power forward next to two-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert. He also posted a career-best effective field goal percentage (60.0) this season and ranks fourth in all-time rebounds in franchise history with 4,250 boards.
Utah was also reportedly interested in Nikola Mirotic, who was set to be offered a three-year, nearly $45 million deal in Utah, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times, before leaving the NBA for Euroleague club Barcelona in Spain. Washington Wizards restricted free agent Bobby Portis was another rumored target in Jazz land before talks fell through following the interest in Bogdanovic.
New Jazz general manager Justin Zanik vowed to be “aggressive” in the free agent market on draft night, just one day after agreeing to trade Kyle Korver, Jae Crowder, Grayson Allen and two first-round picks to Memphis for veteran floor general Mike Conley on Wednesday, June 19.
The Conley deal won’t become official until July 6, but the Jazz will likely have to waive another player such as Raul Neto or Georges Niang from the roster to incorporate Conley’s $32,511,623 salary into their cap space. The salary cap has been set at $109,140,000 for the 2019-20 season while the tax level for the 2019-20 season is $132,627,000. In order to make the current deal work, Utah needed the cap to jump to roughly $109.28 million, per Jeff Siegel of Early Bird Rights.
“We all know that anything can happen and I’m in that situation, too, so I try just to focus on my body, focus on my offseason and getting better and be ready for whatever comes next, whatever will be, and I think I’ll be ready so that’s what I’m focused on,” Neto told the Deseret News during a recent training session in California. “I’m not even thinking about all those trades, and still there’s some things that will happen for sure before the free agency, so I just try to focus on what I can control.”
Utah is coming off its third consecutive postseason appearance, finishing 50-32 this past season before being bounced in the first round by the Houston Rockets. The Jazz have also owned a top-five defensive rating in the past three years, with the second-best defensive rating (105.2) in 2018-19, but the 14th-ranked offense (110.3) is looking to improve with the recent additions of Conley and Bogdanovic.
This is just the start of the ultimate goal.
“I can feel it. It’s always been on my mind,” Gobert said of Utah’s title pursuit. “I play every year to try to win. We feel like the planets are aligned and we will be there very soon.”

Texto completo: Not bad, if you can get it: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch reported an advance of $225,000 for his book due in September, "A Republic, If You Can Keep It." Justice Sonia Sotomayor received $33,000 in royalties for her children's books "Turning Pages: My Life Story" and "The Beloved World of Sonia Sotomayor"; Justice Stephen G. Breyer, $4,415 in royalties. The ABA Journal said the financial disclosure forms for 2018 were released June 13.
Even in his own era, the early 20th century, Melvil Dewey - who created the Dewey Decimal System - was condemned as grossly racist and anti-Semitic, and as a sexual harasser. Now the American Library Association's council has voted unanimously to strike his name from its top honor for librarians. Dewey co-founded the ALA in 1876 and was ostracized from it in 1906. Last year, the name of Laura Ingalls Wilder was removed from an ALA children's lit award, a more difficult decision because her legacy is more complex. (Publishers Weekly)
You Saw It Coming Dept.: The top prosecutor on the team of special counsel Robert Mueller is writing a book. Andrew Weissmann led the prosecution of Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman. A source said Random House is the winning bidder. (CNN)
Ta-Nehisi Coates, who in 2014 wrote "The Case for Reparations" for The Atlantic, also made the argument June 19 before a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee. Among his books: "Between the World and Me," a National Book Award winner that explores, as a letter to his son, what it's like to live in a black body.
Amazon takes a lax approach to counterfeit books, plagiarized works and book summaries, a New York Times report said. Amazon responded that it "strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products" and takes "proactive steps to drive counterfeits in our stores to zero." (Publishers Weekly)
Jojo Moyes' novel "The Giver of Stars" is due in October, and Universal plans to make it a film. The novel is based on true events in Depression-era Kentucky: A group of young women "defy the odds to bring knowledge - and power - to a remote mountain community," Variety reported.
In Case You Missed It: Joy Harjo, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, is the first Native American named U.S. poet laureate, the nation's top advocate for poetry.
Sherrilyn Kenyon's divorce claims against her husband, including that he poisoned her, are explored in Vulture magazine. Kenyon is the bestselling author of paranormal romance novels.
In the pipeline: From Elaine Aron, "The Highly Sensitive Parent: Be Brilliant in Your Role, Even When the World Overwhelms You," due in April. She's written a couple other influential books along those lines. (Publishers Lunch)
Obituaries: Judith Krantz, author of "Scruples" and many other steamy novels of romance and shopping, was 91.
"The Poet X," by Elizabeth Acevedo, won the U.K.'s top children's book award, the Carnegie Medal; the Dominican-American poet is the first writer of color to win in its 83 years.

New and recent
"Alone at Dawn: Medal of Honor Recipient John Chapman and the Untold Story of the World's Deadliest Special Operations Force" by Dan Schilling and Lori Longfritz (Grand Central, 352 pp.). In March 2002, Sgt. Chapman - an Air Force special forces combat controller, and Longfritz's brother - died fighting in Operation Anaconda to save 23 other Americans in Afghanistan's Battle of Takur Ghar mountain.
"The Apology" by Eve Ensler (Bloomsbury, 128 pp.). What if an abuser made amends to his victim? Here Ensler ("The Vagina Monologues") writes a letter in the voice of her father, who physically and sexually abused her when she was a child. "My father is long dead," she explains. "He will not make the apology. So it must be imagined." (Newsday)

Photographs that illustrate "Weir Farm National Historic Site," a new book in the Images of Modern America series published by Arcadia, are on exhibit through July 31 at the Mark Twain Library, 439 Redding Road, Redding.
The farm, located in Wilton and Ridgefield, was owned by Julian Alden Weir (1852-1919), an innovator of American Impressionist painting. The book chronicles his farm's rescue from residential development and establishment as Connecticut's first national park and the only one in the nation dedicated to painting. Its foreword was written by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman who introduced legislation in 1990 to establish the park, whose landscape inspired works by Weir and other painters, including contemporary artists. In 2020, the park will be depicted in the US Mint's America the Beautiful series.
The more than 100 photographs are by the book's author, Xiomaro, who is the Visiting Artist at Weir Farm and an alumnus of its Artist-in-Residence program. His work has been exhibited at Harvard University, museums, galleries and public spaces.
The Library was founded in 1908 by Twain, who lived in Redding at that time. xiomaro.com.

Democrats Prioritize Politics Over People

Texto completo: Nearly six months into the new Congress led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, I offer some observations:
The year began with Democrat leadership fully denying the existence of an illegal immigration crisis at our southern border. Democrat leadership allowed a 35-day government shutdown over a refusal to protect our borders.
On 17 separate occasions in just over one month, House Republicans have attempted to pass legislation that would provide $4.5 billion in humanitarian assistance, which includes
$3.3 billion to fund shelter capacity for unaccompanied children and provide for transportation to safe and efficient border processing centers. This funding is not intended to increase physical border security, which Democrats have long objected to, but rather humanitarian aid. Still, their leadership continues to block this critical funding.
Recent figures are staggering. U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced officers have apprehended or turned back nearly 700,000 migrants in the past eight months. Further, apprehensions in May marked the highest monthly total in 13 years near the southern border, with U.S. authorities detaining or turning away more than 140,000 people - including about 84,000 families and 11,000 minors. Alarmingly, the number of illegal immigrants that have crossed the U.S. border is unknown.
These undeniable facts even led the New York Times editorial board to recently publish a piece encouraging Democrat leadership to finally take action. Instead, they have chosen to prioritize politics over the people. Their goals are crystal clear: they value political messaging that aims to disrupt and resist while choosing to ignore the needs and security of American families.
In fact, this year’s Democrat agenda has focused on policy proposals that incentivize illegal immigration. When debating H.R. 1, sweeping legislation that alters long-standing national election standards, Democrats refused to support a Republican amendment expressing that illegal immigrants should not be allowed to vote in federal elections. Further, Democrats passed H.R. 6, which includes various blanket amnesty provisions. These actions are all part of the Congressional record.
On health care, their policy proposals are unsustainable. Their “Medicare for All” bill promises government-run single payer health care for every person, citizen or not, in the United States.
This would be facilitated through the elimination of hardworking Americans’ employer sponsored healthcare and massive tax increases, at a cost estimate of $32 trillion taxpayer dollars. Additionally, Democrat leadership took a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering prescription drug costs and filled it with partisan poison-pill amendments, such as the banning of Association Health Plans and directing hundreds of millions of dollars into Obamacare’s failed Navigator program.
This Congress should be able to work on issues of real importance, like the proposed United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Democrat leadership has failed to consider and ratify USMCA, a trade deal that is crucial to the booming American economy and the manufacturers, fabricators, distributors, retailers, farmers, and other businesses in Pennsylvania’s Ninth District and our country.
House Republicans, and the President, are continuing to focus on the need for a growing economy, a strong national defense including border security, reduced healthcare costs, free and fair trade agreements, revitalizing our stressed communities, regulatory reform, and pro-growth policies which improve the quality of life of American families. Democrats’ political proposals are focused only on the 2020 election. Instead, we need 20/20 vision - a vision with policy and actions that put Americans first.
U.S. REP. DAN MEUSER, R-Dallas, represents the Ninth Congressional District.

Fact-checking the first Democratic debate

Texto completo: Ten of the Democrats who want to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency took the stage for the first debate of the presidential primary of the 2020 election cycle on Wednesday. Ten more met on Thursday.
Here are some of the candidates’ comments from the first debate night, with fact-checking or additional context.
Beto O’Rourke: “Despite what Purdue Pharma has done — their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we’re seeing throughout this country — they have been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences. Not a single night in jail.”
O’Rourke’s claim about the OxyContin manufacturer is misleading. It’s true that no executives with the pharmaceutical giant have served jail time in connection to the opioid crisis, but it’s a stretch to suggest the firm has acted with “complete impunity” and without consequences.
In March, Purdue Pharma agreed to a $270 million settlement to the state of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, after the state’s attorney general accused the manufacturer of overstating the efficacy of its pain medication while “falsely downplaying the risk of addition to those medications.”
The company has paid other hefty fines in the past. In 2007, the holding company affiliated with Purdue Pharma and three executives at the firm pleaded guilty to charges of misbranding OxyContin and agreed to collectively pay more than $634.5 million in fines — one of the “largest amounts ever paid by a drug company in such a case” at the time, according to the New York Times.
— Madlin Mekelburg
Jay Inslee: “The people who brought us the weekend (were) unions.”
This is largely correct.
After decades of skirmishing over capping regular workdays at eight hours, “demands for the five-day week began to proliferate in 1919, a year in which 4 million American workers went out on strike,” Priscilla Murolo, a professor of history at Sarah Lawrence College, told PolitiFact in 2015. “That was about 20 percent of the industrial labor force.”
It took President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s signing of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 for all workers to see limits on working hours — initially 44 hours a week, then phased to 42 and eventually 40 by 1940. When the law was passed in 1938, Saturday working hours were still common, another labor relations expert told us.
Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., said that while Ford — the founder of the Ford Motor Co. — was an early proponent of the five-day week, “the American Federation of Labor fought for it to be adopted more widely via contract negotiations,” Anderson said. “Unions absolutely deserve much credit for the reform.”
— Louis Jacobson
Amy Klobuchar: “2,500 drug prices have gone up in double digits since Trump took office.”
This is accurate, per a report from Pharmacy Benefits Consultants, an industry group, which listed a number of pharmaceutical products experiencing price increases as high as 1,467.73%.
And the numbers are even less flattering than Klobuchar would suggest.
An analysis by the Associated Press found that, between January and July 2018, more than 4,400 branded prescription drugs experienced price increases. Meanwhile, data compiled by Rx Savings Solutions found that the list price of more than 3,000 drugs went up this year.
— Shefali Luthra, Kaiser Health News
Cory Booker: “We have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.”
Booker certainly has a point that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, but in his effort to make this eye-catching comparison in the debate, he muffed it.
He didn’t specify African American men, so his statement is not accurate. Looking just at men in an earlier fact-check, we found that there were 872,924 male African American slaves over age 15, compared with about 1.68 million African American men under state and federal criminal justice supervision in 2013.
But if you ignore gender, as Booker did in the debate, the number of men, women and children in slavery in 1850 was 3.2 million. And since men (of any race) make up the lion’s share of individuals in prison or under criminal justice supervision, adding women to the total doesn’t increase the number of criminally supervised near as much.

Texto completo: Like many people, I spent the weekend enjoying the beautiful weather - in my case, with my 4-year-old toddler and 8-week-old newborn. During late night feedings and naps, though, I also spent hours on social media. I shared happy pictures of my babies, but also, in a heartbreaking juxtaposition, pored over the latest news from the border.
For those who haven't read about it, multiple news outlets, from the New York Times to Fox News, reported that hundreds of children as young as 2 are being held in inhumane conditions. They are in overcrowded cells, without soap or toothbrushes, without diapers or clean clothes, sleeping on cold floors with the lights on all night. Older children are doing their best to comfort other children they have only just met.
Attorneys from the Justice Department argued that none of this violated their legal duty to provide "safe and sanitary" conditions for children.
Beyond the latest reports, we also know that thousands of children have been separated from their parents and that there have been thousands of reports of sexual assault and abuse in these detention facilities. In the past year alone, at least seven children have died in detention - after a decade of no deaths.
We have all heard the grotesque stories of children in the U.S. being held captive in basements, sexually abused and tortured by strangers and family members alike. I know we recoil at these stories, usually recounted in tearful interviews with People magazine or special reports on television. Who among us, if we knew this was happening, would decline to help one of these children?
And yet, this kind of horrific treatment is happening on a mass scale, perpetrated by our very own government. And maddeningly, we have known about it for at least a year.
As I read report after report, I felt increasingly saddened, enraged and frustrated at the overwhelming scope of the problem and my own humble ability to do anything meaningful to affect change. My frustration grew worse as I searched phrases like "how to help migrant children" and "protests for migrant children" only to see articles from exactly a year ago, when there was a public outcry that resulted in Families Belong Together marches across the country.
There were only a handful of search results from this year. How, in a whole year, has this continued?
This crisis should be front page news and front-of-mind daily. We cannot forget that this is not normal, not something to be turned away from because the images and stories are too sad to bear and seemingly beyond our control. We must continue seeking information about how to address this crisis in any and every way possible. For me, that means making humble donations to organizations that are providing legal representation nationally, like the ACLU and RAICES and humanitarian aid, like Kino Border Initiative.
As someone who has worked in the nonprofit sector my entire career, I know that even the smallest of gifts (and believe me, with two children, mine are small!), are welcomed gratefully.
For me, addressing this crisis means desperately Googling protests like Lights for Liberty, which will hold candlelight vigils at border facilities and the U.S. Capitol Building on the evening of July 12. It means building relationships with other concerned citizens to ensure that we're thinking of every possible way to help. It means writing daily letters to our elected representatives, who have been far too quiet on this issue. It means posting regularly on social media to keep the conversation alive. And, it means writing an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun.
Whether you agree with current asylum laws (and it is federal law that immigrants have a legal right to seek asylum), surely we must all agree that no fellow human - much less a child - deserves this kind of treatment. We cannot turn away.

Texto completo: Movie Review
★★★
TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM
Directed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. At Kendall Square and Coolidge Corner. 120 minutes. PG-13 (some disturbing images/thematic material).
If you're thinking of spending two hours watching a documentary about Toni Morrison, there are a few things you likely already know.
You probably know that she's the Nobel- and Pulitzer-winning author of “Beloved" (1987) and “The Bluest Eye" (1970). You probably know that she writes about slavery and its white-knuckled grip on the present, that she chronicles black life in America as an entanglement of history and myth. Depending on which teacher introduced you to her books, you might know that her ascent inflamed the eternal debate about the place of marginalized writers in the literary establishment, that she simultaneously blew that argument open and rendered it irrelevant. In other words: If you're even thinking about taking two hours of your day to watch “Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am," you probably don't need to be convinced that Toni Morrison is a big deal.
So Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, the director and a friend of the subject, has a few hurdles in front of him. How do you turn a literary career into something compelling for the screen? How do you make a fresh argument about the greatness of Morrison to an audience that doesn't need to be persuaded? And why should anyone bother watching a movie about the brilliance of Toni Morrison when they could pick up one of her books and experience it for themselves?
“Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" roughly traces her life from the arrival of her family in the small industrial city of Lorain, Ohio, to her eminent present. It documents Morrison's early career as an editor at Random House and her transition to writing fiction full time. It emphasizes just a few of her novels, namely “The Bluest Eye," “Sula," (1973) “Song of Solomon," (1977) and “Beloved." The film successfully charts Morrison's journey to the literary firmament without accepting a simple definition of greatness. It's clear that her genius is independent of the honors she's received. The white-dominated literary world and its initial hostility to Morrison make up a big part of the story, but by the time she receives her Nobel, in 1993, it's seems as if these things are beside the point.
The movie isn't flashy or stylish. It's composed of talking-head interviews with professors, critics, colleagues, friends, and the famously reticent Morrison. The conversations are livened up with relevant archival materials and still images by artists such as Kerry James Marshall, Jacob Lawrence, Kara Walker, and Gordon Parks. But the most captivating footage is, of course, the interview with Morrison. She sits at the center of the screen, speaking directly to the camera. The effect is intimate, but not cozy. It's like attending office hours for the professor you love and fear. Morrison speaks candidly and extemporaneously but delivers her answers like a stage actor. You feel lucky to bask in her gaze.
Morrison's majestic presence reverberates in all the other interviews. The impressive roster of interviewees includes superstar collaborators such as Oprah Winfrey and black radical activist Angela Davis, critics and scholars, like Hilton Als and Columbia University's Farah Griffin, and figures from Morrison's career as an editor, like Robert Gottlieb, the publishing colleague who would go on to edit most of her books. Some of the most delicious details are shared by the blazer-clad, nicotine-voiced writer Fran Lebowitz, who was once scolded for distracting Morrison from her editorial work at Random House. Predictably, all of these speakers praise their friend and colleague.
The litany of praise can feel monotonous, but it's tempered with humor. It's fun to hear about America's most famous talk-show host's farcical attempt to track down Morrison's contact information (Oprah ended up calling the fire department in Morrison's town to get connected). It's enjoyable to watch the indomitable Angela Davis admit, smiling, that Morrison “persuaded me that the book she wanted to publish was the book I wanted to write, only I was not aware of it at that time." The person who seems most tickled by Morrison's power and influence is Morrison herself. She has a letter hanging in her bathroom, she says, from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which banned her novel “Paradise" (1997) in fear of enabling a prison riot.
“How powerful is that?" Morrison says with a laugh. “I could tear up the whole place."
The effusive interviews with colleagues and admirers work to illustrate the conflict between Morrison and an establishment that was foolish enough to doubt her. The film does a bit of delightful score-settling as it revisits a New York Times review that called “Sula" “provincial" and a Washington Post article that quoted male writers who were embittered by her success. “'Beloved' was a fraud," an anonymous voice-over reads mockingly.
It's a solemn story, too. As an editor, Morrison fought for the writing of black luminaries such as Davis and Gayl Jones. She recounts being pitted against Jones and novelist Ishmael Reed, in a contest of depicting black life “accurately." She recalls that she couldn't call herself a writer until after she had published her third book.
The film deftly balances the politics of the literary establishment with the real consequences of being shut out of it. Greenfield-Sanders smartly filters the concluding Nobel Prize sequence through the funny, fast-talking Lebowitz, who was invited to the festivities in Sweden as one of Morrison's guests. It keeps us from taking the ceremony too seriously. “I highly recommend that you have a friend who wins the Nobel Prize," Lebowitz says.

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
'CHULAS FRONTERAS' AND 'DEL MERO CORAZÓN' at the Metrograph (June 28-July 4). "Zacatecas to Minnesota/From Tijuana to New York/Two countries are my home/I'll defend them both with honor," a group of musicians sings at the end of "Chulas Fronteras," a 1976 documentary by Les Blank that captures the music scene near the Texas-Mexico border, particularly on the Texas side, where Tejano performers' traditions thrive in the American melting pot. (Their songs have touches of German polka, for instance.) Showing with a related short, "Del Mero Corazón," the film addresses issues of identity, labor and protest in ways that seem as timely as ever.

'DO THE RIGHT THING' at various theaters (June 28-July 4). Thirty years have passed since Spike Lee's revelatory look at racial tensions on a sweltering block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, became a flash point for conversations across the United States, but the vitality of Lee's filmmaking, his characters and the Public Enemy backbeat remain as strong as ever. The movie is being rereleased in North American theaters; some will show it all week (at BAM Rose Cinemas and IFC Center, select screenings will be on 35 millimeter), others just on Sunday, the anniversary of the film's original release.

NEW YORK ASIAN FILM FESTIVAL at Film at Lincoln Center and the SVA Theater (June 28-July 14). This year's festival of (mainly) contemporary Asian cinema kicks off with a marathon -- specifically "Samurai Marathon" (on Friday), a historical drama directed by Bernard Rose ("Candyman"). In the 1850s, as foreign ships converge on Japan, a feudal lord contrives a race to strengthen the minds and bodies of his men for a potential invasion, and his daughter joins in. The festival will present a lifetime-achievement award to Yuen Woo-ping, the martial arts choreographer whose wizardry with action has been seen in "The Grandmaster," the "Kill Bill" films, "The Matrix" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Three of his features as a director will be shown, with Yuen in attendance: "Master Z: Ip Man Legacy" (on Monday), "The Miracle Fighters" (on Tuesday) and "Iron Monkey" (on Wednesday).

'ONE SINGS, THE OTHER DOESN'T' at Syndicated (June 29-30). This 1977 feature from Agnès Varda (1928-2019) follows two friends -- Pauline (Valérie Mairesse), a choir singer who, as the film begins, has not yet left her parents' home, and the slightly older Suzanne (Thérèse Liotard), who was perhaps too young when she settled for a life of domesticity -- from the early 1960s through the '70s, a time of passionate politics and feminism in France. "Arguing for abortion rights while celebrating motherhood, 'One Sings' is an anthology of Ms. Varda's other interests, including photography, documenting rural France and unconventional domestic arrangements," J. Hoberman wrote in The New York Times when the film played in a restoration last year.
718-386-3399, syndicatedbk.com
SUMMER OF MICHEL LEGRAND at French Institute Alliance Française (July 2-30). The great French composer, who worked on films by Jacques Demy, Agnès Varda, Jean-Luc Godard and Orson Welles (including on last year's "The Other Side of the Wind"), died in January. This retrospective pays tribute to Legrand with screenings of some of his most celebrated films, a lineup bookended by two Demy classics: the all-sung "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" (on Tuesday) and its larger-canvas, meta-musical follow-up, "The Young Girls of Rochefort" (on July 30). That screening that will be followed by Legrand karaoke. The French Institute doesn't say anything about performing songs dressed as Catherine Deneuve and Françoise Dorléac's "twins born in the sign of Gemini" or as Gene Kelly. But nothing's stopping you, either.

Texto completo: Re "Uproar over tragedy on Rio Grande," June 26
Reading the article and seeing that terrible picture of the young father with his toddler daughter lying dead on the riverbank brought back to mind the iconic photo of the "Napalm Girl" in Vietnam, taken some 47 years ago.
That photo had some impact on bringing this country to its senses about the atrocities that were being committed as a result of the United States' involvement in Vietnam and helped bring an end to that war. If there is any possible good to come from this current photo, perhaps it will bring an end to the policies that resulted in this horrific tragedy.

Dave Wilson
Murrieta
::
I am writing through tears of shame and disgust that this father and daughter died while escaping from El Salvador to find a better life. Where is our humanity?
This photo deserves to be on the front page so that everyone can see the risks people take to find safety and security in another country.
We call ourselves the "land of the free and home of the brave." Perhaps it is time to change our national anthem if the powers that be continue to politicize this humanitarian issue.
Varini de Silva
Huntington Beach
::
Very tragic and sad photo in my newspaper today. I say "my" newspaper because I've read the L.A. Times every day since I was 15 years old, so for the past 45 years.
What exactly is the paper's policy on death photos? Migrants die in the deserts trying to get into the United States every day. But the daily deaths in Los Angeles are not even reported in this paper, let alone pictured.
There is so much needed reporting that can be done just focusing on California and L.A.'s problems; this paper needs to relish in and exploit that niche. Trying to be the New York Times or Washington Post is not what is needed.

Democrats, take responsibility
Re "The bodies at the border," editorial, June 27
It is most unfortunate that the infrastructure at our southern border has reached a breaking point amid reports of worsening conditions of detained immigrants, as well as the deaths of several children.
And while President Trump and the Republicans share some complicity in the lack of enacting real solutions to the problem, it is the Democrats who are most guilty of exploiting the deaths and deplorable conditions for their own political expediency.
It is the Democrats who equate "comprehensive" immigration reform with a total amnesty for anyone who is able to successfully transition across our southern border illegally, without an emphasis on defining and enforcing stricter conditions of border security, asylum requirements, and deportation.
It is also the Democrats, with their establishment of sanctuary cities and states, as well as policies that restrict local law enforcement from communicating with federal immigration authorities about inmates' citizenship, immigration status, and release dates, who create the perverse incentives for migrants risking the treacherous trek to reach our southern border.
Jim Redhead
San Diego
::
The Times' editorial starts by referencing "the enormity of the migration crisis."
A million undocumented immigrants are expected to enter the country this year. For months, major figures in the Democratic party have denied that there is any crisis at all, using adjectives such as "fake" crisis and "non-existent" crisis.
If people continue to deny there is a crisis at the border and argue for further opening up of mass immigration, it will no longer be a crisis at the border, but a crisis in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Natchez, Mississippi, and everywhere else.

Re "Wayfair migrant facility contract targeted," June 26
Wayfair, Bank of America, and other businesses that have provided or may provide relief for migrants captured after illegally crossing the border into the U.S. are punished for providing beds, other furniture, supplies for these detainees. Soon, grocers will be forced to stop providing food.
How does this help those people? We complain there are no beds, but hassle those providing them. It's not just Congress that has its collective head on sideways.
Suzanne Brugman
La Habra Heights
::
So many of us are sickened by reports of the emotional and phys-ical tolls that these camps are perpetuating, so I wrote to the head of Wayfair.
He can speak for all of us by making a strong statement in support of the kids' minimal comfort while condemning the actions of our government. He can send the profits from these sales to groups like RAICES that are fighting to stop this horror.

The debates are a snooze
Re "Don't call it a Democratic debate in Miami," opinion, June 26
After a long and puffy speech by Stephen Douglas during one of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln asked the audience, "How many legs would a horse have if you called his tail a leg?" "Five," called out some of the onlookers. "Four," replied Lincoln. "Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it true." Similarly calling the gathering of the Democratic presidential candidates this week a "debate" doesn't make it true.
President Eisenhower had serious doubts about the value of debates in a presidential election as he opined they tended to be a test of reaction time rather than a genuine exposition of the participants' philosophies and programs.
To prevent these joint appearances from being boring, they might adopt a format similar to the 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates. No more questions from reporters or the audience. Just have the candidates state their respective positions and then question each other.
Norman G. Axe
Santa Monica
::
In 2015-2016, there was a herd of 17 Republican candidates for president who negated each other by sharing campaign funding, diluted votes in the primary, and elected and established the least qualified candidate for President.
We have a mirror image of the 2015-2016 Republican situation with the herd of Democrats running for president in the 2020 election. These candidates want to feed their egos and gain name recognition for future local elections.
Most of these Democratic candidates are unqualified to be president, and one of them could end up running against the current unqualified Republican incumbent in 2020.
As an Independent, I vote for the candidate who is most qualified for the position. If the Republican and Democratic candidates for president are not qualified, then I will vote for myself.

Re "FTC is cracking down on robocalls," June 26
I've nearly cracked the robocall problem, in just a couple of months. I bought a new mobile phone with a "call block" key. I put it on one of my extensions, and I used the key regularly for about two weeks. (When I pick up one of the other extensions, without the key, I vow to get them next time.) My phone is now mercifully silent for long periods. It's working!
Some of the robocallers' voices had become familiar, and I must admit I was no longer polite or courteous when they still pestered. I trust they found other customers to harass.

Re "For a more peaceful vision of the future, look to the Olympics," opinion, June 27
The irony, the irony. Henry Kissinger, the ultimate, unabashed, pathetic war hawk widely decried as helping sacrifice millions of lives, blathering on (turgidly) about world peace.
What's next: Vladimir Putin on freedom of the press, Xi Jinping on street demonstrations, Kim Jong Un on religion?

Texto completo: If you're thinking of spending two hours watching a documentary about Toni Morrison, there are a few things you likely already know.
You probably know that she's the Nobel- and Pulitzer-winning author of “Beloved" (1987) and “The Bluest Eye" (1970). You probably know that she writes about slavery and its white-knuckled grip on the present, that she chronicles black life in America as an entanglement of history and myth. Depending on which teacher introduced you to her books, you might know that her ascent inflamed the eternal debate about the place of marginalized writers in the literary establishment, that she simultaneously blew that argument open and rendered it irrelevant. In other words: If you're even thinking about taking two hours of your day to watch “Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am," you probably don't need to be convinced that Toni Morrison is a big deal.
So Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, the director and a friend of the subject, has a few hurdles in front of him. How do you turn a literary career into something compelling for the screen? How do you make a fresh argument about the greatness of Morrison to an audience that doesn't need to be persuaded? And why should anyone bother watching a movie about the brilliance of Toni Morrison when they could pick up one of her books and experience it for themselves?
“Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" roughly traces her life from the arrival of her family in the small industrial city of Lorain, Ohio, to her eminent present. It documents Morrison's early career as an editor at Random House and her transition to writing fiction full time. It emphasizes just a few of her novels, namely “The Bluest Eye," “Sula," (1973) “Song of Solomon," (1977) and “Beloved." The film successfully charts Morrison's journey to the literary firmament without accepting a simple definition of greatness. It's clear that her genius is independent of the honors she's received. The white-dominated literary world and its initial hostility to Morrison make up a big part of the story, but by the time she receives her Nobel, in 1993, it's seems as if these things are beside the point.
The movie isn't flashy or stylish. It's composed of talking-head interviews with professors, critics, colleagues, friends, and the famously reticent Morrison. The conversations are livened up with relevant archival materials and still images by artists such as Kerry James Marshall, Jacob Lawrence, Kara Walker, and Gordon Parks. But the most captivating footage is, of course, the interview with Morrison. She sits at the center of the screen, speaking directly to the camera. The effect is intimate, but not cozy. It's like attending office hours for the professor you love and fear. Morrison speaks candidly and extemporaneously but delivers her answers like a stage actor. You feel lucky to bask in her gaze.
Morrison's majestic presence reverberates in all the other interviews. The impressive roster of interviewees includes superstar collaborators such as Oprah Winfrey and black radical activist Angela Davis, critics and scholars, like Hilton Als and Columbia University's Farah Griffin, and figures from Morrison's career as an editor, like Robert Gottlieb, the publishing colleague who would go on to edit most of her books. Some of the most delicious details are shared by the blazer-clad, nicotine-voiced writer Fran Lebowitz, who was once scolded for distracting Morrison from her editorial work at Random House. Predictably, all of these speakers praise their friend and colleague.
The litany of praise can feel monotonous, but it's tempered with humor. It's fun to hear about America's most famous talk-show host's farcical attempt to track down Morrison's contact information (Oprah ended up calling the fire department in Morrison's town to get connected). It's enjoyable to watch the indomitable Angela Davis admit, smiling, that Morrison “persuaded me that the book she wanted to publish was the book I wanted to write, only I was not aware of it at that time." The person who seems most tickled by Morrison's power and influence is Morrison herself. She has a letter hanging in her bathroom, she says, from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which banned her novel “Paradise" (1997) in fear of enabling a prison riot.
“How powerful is that?" Morrison says with a laugh. “I could tear up the whole place."
The effusive interviews with colleagues and admirers work to illustrate the conflict between Morrison and an establishment that was foolish enough to doubt her. The film does a bit of delightful score-settling as it revisits a New York Times review that called “Sula" “provincial" and a Washington Post article that quoted male writers who were embittered by her success. “'Beloved' was a fraud," an anonymous voice-over reads mockingly.
It's a solemn story, too. As an editor, Morrison fought for the writing of black luminaries such as Davis and Gayl Jones. She recounts being pitted against Jones and novelist Ishmael Reed, in a contest of depicting black life “accurately." She recalls that she couldn't call herself a writer until after she had published her third book.
The film deftly balances the politics of the literary establishment with the real consequences of being shut out of it. Greenfield-Sanders smartly filters the concluding Nobel Prize sequence through the funny, fast-talking Lebowitz, who was invited to the festivities in Sweden as one of Morrison's guests. It keeps us from taking the ceremony too seriously. “I highly recommend that you have a friend who wins the Nobel Prize," Lebowitz says.
★★★ TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM
Directed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders. At Kendall Square and Coolidge Corner. 120 minutes. PG-13 (some disturbing images/thematic material).

Donald Trump: fire starter

Texto completo: The word "brinkmanship" is probably not in the vocabulary of the self-proclaimed genius who is president of the United States. But Donald Trump certainly seems to get his jollies from creating crises, setting deadlines and then, just before time to make good on his threats, swooping in with a postponement that, in his mind, makes him the great humanitarian.
The scenario is as predictable as his choice of Twitter to announce major presidential decisions. But it is also alarming. Will we soon be at war with Iran? What about his tweet that in two weeks "big Deportation begins"?
Consider the Iran situation. The president vowed to get even with Iran for shooting down a surveillance drone last Thursday morning. Iranian officials say it was in their airspace; the U.S. denies that. By Thursday night planes "were in the air and ships were in position," the New York Times reported. In the president's words, they were "cocked and loaded" to strike Iranian targets when, "10 minutes before the strike I stopped it," he tweeted. Why? Because he had just learned that at least 150 Iranian people might be casualties. The Washington Post soon debunked that timeline, raising questions about his "decision-making process" and "concerns about the Trump administration's credibility at a time of military crisis" that should alarm even his most ardent Make America Great Again acolytes. After all, they and their loved ones would be called to fight this battle for angry old men in suits in Washington and robes in Tehran.
Was he truthful about when he learned about potential casualties? "I talked to a former top national security official in an earlier Republican administration who says this just doesn't add up," Chris Wallace said on Fox News - yes, Mr. Trump's favorite network. Like journalists at newspapers the president despises, Mr. Wallace cast doubt on whether a mission could have advanced so far before the president learned of the potential loss of life.
There's no need for sugar coating: Mr. Trump's benevolence is, to borrow one of his favorite words, "fake."
So is the statesmanship for which he credits himself. On June 17, he tweeted: "Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens... They will be removed as fast as they come in." Church leaders and politicians in Baltimore and other cities scrambled to protect vulnerable immigrants. But four days later, at "the request of Democrats," the president swooped in to save people from his own Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents by postponing the raids.
In his mind, he's a bipartisan humanitarian. From where I sit, he's more like the pyromaniac who deliberately sets fires and then becomes a hero as a first responder.
He still promises Iran "obliteration like you've never seen before" and mass deportation that would tear apart undocumented immigrant families in cities across the nation. Oh, by the way, more than two years into his own presidency, he blames his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the Trump administration's inhumane treatment of migrant families with children. He conveniently glosses over the images of detained children being held in cages on his watch and the chaotic record-keeping of his immigration officials that has led to the misplacement of children who may never again see their parents.
This president has a short supply of what is needed in times of crisis: credibility. Apparently, he and truth are not well acquainted, as various fact-checking services have attested. How can we believe him if he says that war is unavoidable? How can we follow a commander-in-chief who, when it was his time to serve, claimed his privileged rich boy's bad feet excused him from marching off to war in Southeast Asia? How can we believe him when he says that immigrants at the Mexican border pose more of a threat than those at the Canadian border? How can we not wonder whether his saber rattling is a campaign gambit? Or is meant to divert our attention from escalating investigations into his conduct as a businessman and as president?
Deciphering the president is a tedious necessity that makes these questions paramount: When will diehard MAGAs see that, like the fabled emperor, their leader has no clothes and, moreover, has no respect for the values that they, as conservatives, should be conserving? Will the self-satisfied resistance movement of 2017 rally around candidates who can bring an end to the madness of King Trump in 2020?

Susannah Hunnewell, 52, deft interviewer, editor at The Paris Review

Texto completo: The Paris Review “writers at work" interviews are an iconic feature in the legendary literary journal, though the essential, less-heralded participants in those conversations aren't the writers. They are interviewers such as Susannah Hunnewell, whose artful questions over the years elicited illuminating — and sometimes surprising — responses from novelists and translators.
In the introductions she wrote for interviews she conducted, Ms. Hunnewell showed she was as keen an observer and listener as she was a questioner. The writer Harry Mathews, she noted for an interview published in 2007, “speaks with the nearly extinct mid-Atlantic accent that can carry off rather and alas ."
Emmanuel Carrère, she wrote to introduce a 2013 interview, had the slight tan and look of “a French journalist, which means he can carry off a scarf and a vaguely fatigue-like jacket with panache."
In 2010, the controversial French writer Michel Houellebecq smoked heavily and drew from Ms. Hunnewell a particularly evocative description about their two-day conversation: “Each of my questions met with a funereal silence, during which he blew smoke and closed his eyes. More than once I began to wonder whether he had fallen asleep. Eventually the answer would emerge, in an exhausted monotone which grew only slightly less weary the second day."
Ms. Hunnewell, who was the publisher of The Paris Review after previously serving as its Paris editor, was 52 when she died June 15 in New York City of cancer. She had spent part of her youth in Wellesley and was descended from a family whose estates gave the town its name.
“The long interviews with writers published in The Paris Review are renowned both for their seriousness and their liberty, but it wasn't until I met Susannah Hunnewell that I was able to determine what this seriousness and liberty could be," Carrère told the journal, which quoted him in its online tribute. “We spent two days together; I would have liked for us to have spent three, four, five …"
In its online “In Memoriam," the journal said that “her three decades with the magazine, a span made better by her intelligence, kindness, and great spirit, have left an indelible imprint on The Paris Review."
During interviews she conducted with writers, Ms. Hunnewell was a stand-in for curious readers — someone who knew just what to ask of someone such as Kazuo Ishiguro, author of “The Remains of the Day." At times her questions were a single word, or a comment designed to inspire an expansive response.
Some inquiries were gentle. Others, with someone like Houellebecq, were bracingly direct — in more than one instance drawing short answers that cast in sharp relief the author and his writing.
“You have a special talent for insult. Do you take pleasure in insulting?" Ms. Hunnewell asked.
“Yes," Houellebecq conceded. “It is, I have to say, satisfying."
The quick, incisive intellect she displayed in those interviews was only part of what made Ms. Hunnewell memorable, friends recalled for another tribute on The Paris Review's website. She was, friends said, expressively enthusiastic about places to visit, people to meet, culture to absorb.
“She knew how to let loose," the painter Duncan Hannah wrote. “Susannah was smitten with punk rock and all manners of bohemia. She danced with abandon, and I remember a hair-raising drive uptown as she accidentally ran red lights and swerved through traffic, pumping her fist to the ear-splitting sounds of The Ramones. She wasn't what I might have expected from an Ivy League, blue-blooded mother of three. When she liked something, she really liked something."
Born in Boston in 1966, Susannah Gordon Hunnewell was a daughter of Elizabeth Milton Hunnewell and Francis Oakes Hunnewell, an entrepreneur whose ancestor Horatio Hollis Hunnewell named the family estate Wellesley — a word Horatio fashioned from Welles, his wife's maiden name.
Ms. Hunnewell's mother, a writer, recalled in a 2011 piece for the Globe Sunday Magazine that Susannah could also be enthusiastic about matters such as Elizabeth's decision to let her hair go fully gray.
“My daughter, Susannah, who lives in Manhattan but swears she can get almost anything she wants in Wellesley, sprinted into the house with the news," Elizabeth wrote. “ 'Mom, there's a big sign in the window of a beauty parlor on Central Street.' She threw her packages on the sofa. 'It says “Best in Boston for Turning Hair Gray." Here.' She thrust a card at me. 'I've made an appointment for you with Helena.' "
Ms. Hunnewell's father, who died in 2010, was as passionate about his enthusiasms as his daughter was about hers, and he cut an unforgettable figure.
During a casual evening at home, he might light fires in every fireplace of the family's Victorian in Wellesley, and “then he would suddenly emerge wearing black velvet pants and those sort of old-fashioned tuxedo slippers and a beautiful shirt with a wild, silk Chinese tie and this gold disco jacket that I had given to him" — a look which, on him, was “rather chic," she told the Globe for his obituary.
The Hunnewells lived in Paris during Ms. Hunnewell's childhood and early teen years, before returning to Wellesley when she was high school age. She graduated from the Winsor School and from Harvard University, receiving a bachelor's degree in English.
Near the end of the 1980s, Ms. Hunnewell joined The Paris Review as an editorial intern. Her duties grew to include reading writers' submissions and editing, and she also was a translator. George Plimpton, the journal's former editor, credited her with helping put together “The Paris Review Anthology," published in 1990.
While working there, she met Antonio Weiss, an editor who was then Plimpton's assistant. They married in 1993.
Weiss, now a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, served as counselor to the US treasury secretary at the end of President Obama's second term and was a partner at the investment company Lazard — work that brought him and Ms. Hunnewell to Europe.
They have three sons, Niccolò, Ottocaro, and Cosimo. Along with her husband and mother, Ms. Hunnewell leaves a brother, Oakes, and a sister, Lee.
Though she remained affiliated with The Paris Review, Ms. Hunnewell also formerly worked as a news clerk at The New York Times, as an editor at the American edition of Marie Claire magazine, and as associate editor at John F. Kennedy Jr.'s political magazine George.
In spring last year, while Ms. Hunnewell was publisher, The Paris Review appointed Emily Nemens to be the journal's top editor. At the time, Ms. Hunnewell praised Nemens' “proven track record for finding diverse new voices outside of established networks."
The review's previous editor, Lorin Stein, had resigned after being accused of sexual misconduct toward female employees and writers.
In November, Ms. Hunnewell was named a chevalier in the French order of arts and letters.
“Your way with words isn't merely scholarly and lettered; it seems to permeate every aspect of your life and character," Bénédicte de Montlaur, cultural counselor of the French Embassy in the United States, said at the New York City ceremony. “Your wit, repartee, and tongue-in-cheek humor are praised by all, and all ascribe these to your impeccable literary taste."

“The long interviews with writers published in The Paris Review are renowned both for their seriousness and their liberty, but it wasn't until I met Susannah Hunnewell that I was able to determine what this seriousness and liberty could be," Carrère told the journal, which quoted him in its online tribute. “We spent two days together; I would have liked for us to have spent three, four, five …"
In its online “In Memoriam," the journal said that “her three decades with the magazine, a span made better by her intelligence, kindness, and great spirit, have left an indelible imprint on The Paris Review."
During interviews she conducted with writers, Ms. Hunnewell was a stand-in for curious readers — someone who knew just what to ask of someone such as Kazuo Ishiguro, author of “The Remains of the Day." At times her questions were a single word, or a comment designed to inspire an expansive response.
Some inquiries were gentle. Others, with someone like Houellebecq, were bracingly direct — in more than one instance drawing short answers that cast in sharp relief the author and his writing.
“You have a special talent for insult. Do you take pleasure in insulting?" Ms. Hunnewell asked.
“Yes," Houellebecq conceded. “It is, I have to say, satisfying."
The quick, incisive intellect she displayed in those interviews was only part of what made Ms. Hunnewell memorable, friends recalled for another tribute on The Paris Review's website. She was, friends said, expressively enthusiastic about places to visit, people to meet, culture to absorb.
“She knew how to let loose," the painter Duncan Hannah wrote. “Susannah was smitten with punk rock and all manners of bohemia. She danced with abandon, and I remember a hair-raising drive uptown as she accidentally ran red lights and swerved through traffic, pumping her fist to the ear-splitting sounds of The Ramones. She wasn't what I might have expected from an Ivy League, blue-blooded mother of three. When she liked something, she really liked something."
Born in Boston in 1966, Susannah Gordon Hunnewell was a daughter of Elizabeth Milton Hunnewell and Francis Oakes Hunnewell, an entrepreneur whose ancestor Horatio Hollis Hunnewell named the family estate Wellesley — a word Horatio fashioned from Welles, his wife's maiden name.
Ms. Hunnewell's mother, a writer, recalled in a 2011 piece for the Globe Sunday Magazine that Susannah could also be enthusiastic about matters such as Elizabeth's decision to let her hair go fully gray.
“My daughter, Susannah, who lives in Manhattan but swears she can get almost anything she wants in Wellesley, sprinted into the house with the news," Elizabeth wrote. “ 'Mom, there's a big sign in the window of a beauty parlor on Central Street.' She threw her packages on the sofa. 'It says “Best in Boston for Turning Hair Gray." Here.' She thrust a card at me. 'I've made an appointment for you with Helena.' "
Ms. Hunnewell's father, who died in 2010, was as passionate about his enthusiasms as his daughter was about hers, and he cut an unforgettable figure.
During a casual evening at home, he might light fires in every fireplace of the family's Victorian in Wellesley, and “then he would suddenly emerge wearing black velvet pants and those sort of old-fashioned tuxedo slippers and a beautiful shirt with a wild, silk Chinese tie and this gold disco jacket that I had given to him" — a look which, on him, was “rather chic," she told the Globe for his obituary.
The Hunnewells lived in Paris during Ms. Hunnewell's childhood and early teen years, before returning to Wellesley when she was high school age. She graduated from the Winsor School and from Harvard University, receiving a bachelor's degree in English.
Near the end of the 1980s, Ms. Hunnewell joined The Paris Review as an editorial intern. Her duties grew to include reading writers' submissions and editing, and she also was a translator. George Plimpton, the journal's former editor, credited her with helping put together “The Paris Review Anthology," published in 1990.
While working there, she met Antonio Weiss, an editor who was then Plimpton's assistant. They married in 1993.
Weiss, now a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, served as counselor to the US treasury secretary at the end of President Obama's second term and was a partner at the investment company Lazard — work that brought him and Ms. Hunnewell to Europe.
They have three sons, Niccolò, Ottocaro, and Cosimo. Along with her husband and mother, Ms. Hunnewell leaves a brother, Oakes, and a sister, Lee.
Though she remained affiliated with The Paris Review, Ms. Hunnewell also formerly worked as a news clerk at The New York Times, as an editor at the American edition of Marie Claire magazine, and as associate editor at John F. Kennedy Jr.'s political magazine George.
In spring last year, while Ms. Hunnewell was publisher, The Paris Review appointed Emily Nemens to be the journal's top editor. At the time, Ms. Hunnewell praised Nemens' “proven track record for finding diverse new voices outside of established networks."
The review's previous editor, Lorin Stein, had resigned after being accused of sexual misconduct toward female employees and writers.
In November, Ms. Hunnewell was named a chevalier in the French order of arts and letters.
“Your way with words isn't merely scholarly and lettered; it seems to permeate every aspect of your life and character," Bénédicte de Montlaur, cultural counselor of the French Embassy in the United States, said at the New York City ceremony. “Your wit, repartee, and tongue-in-cheek humor are praised by all, and all ascribe these to your impeccable literary taste."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department's internal watchdog has agreed to look into why designs of a new $ 20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman will not be unveiled next year.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, last week asked the Treasury Department's inspector general to open an investigation following Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's announcement at a May Congressional hearing that designs of the new $ 20 would be unveiled in 2026 instead of 2020 -- the 100th anniversary of women gaining the right to vote.
Mr. Mnuchin, at the hearing, would not commit to Tubman being featured on the note, diverging from the plan and timeline set by the Obama administration and leaving the decision to a future Treasury secretary.
Treasury's inspector general, in a letter to Mr. Schumer dated June 21, said that the review of the $ 20 would be included in an already-planned audit of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's process for designing new notes and security features. That audit will include interviews with senior officials from Treasury, the B.E.P., the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors and the Secret Service. A formal investigation will be opened if any indication of misconduct surrounding the delay emerge during the inquiry.
"I believe this approach will efficiently address the concerns expressed in your request," Rich Delmar, the acting inspector general at Treasury, wrote in a letter to Mr. Schumer.
Mr. Delmar said that the review would specifically include the process with respect to the $ 20 bill.
"If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously," Mr. Delmar added.
The audit is expected to take 10 months. Mr. Delmar said that work would begin before the end of June.
Mr. Mnuchin has said that it was his responsibility to focus on anti-counterfeiting measures with the note and that the $ 20 bill would still come into circulation by 2030. Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that extensive work on a note featuring Tubman began before President Trump took office and continued until at least 2018.
As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump said that replacing the $ 20 bill's current occupant, Andrew Jackson, with Tubman, a former slave and abolitionist, was "pure political correctness."
A Treasury spokesman said that the timeline for issuing the new $ 20 note is not a political process and that security and preventing counterfeiting is the department's priority.
Mr. Schumer said in a statement that he was happy that the matter is being reviewed.
"I'm pleased the inspector general will review this matter and hope it is conducted in an expeditious fashion," Mr. Schumer said. "There are no women, there are no people of color on our paper currency today, even though they make up a significant majority of our population, and the previous administration's plan to put New Yorker Harriet Tubman on the $ 20 note was a long overdue way to recognize that disparity, and rectify it."
He added, "The motivation for the Trump administration's decision to delay the release of the new note has not been credibly explained, and the inspector general's review must get to the bottom of this."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The Desert Sun is welcoming four new journalists to the newsroom.
Gabrielle Paluch is taking up a new beat at The Desert Sun, focusing on wildfires and the environment. With more intense, destructive and deadly fires becoming what former Gov. Jerry Brown called "the new normal," Paluch will be on the front lines when a wildfire breaks out in the Coachella Valley and elsewhere around the state, collaborating with our fellow USA Today Network reporters in Los Angeles, Ventura, Visalia, Salinas, San Francisco, Redding and Reno.
Already this year, we have witnessed multiple fires in the Thermal area and in Palm Springs. When things are not literally on fire, Paluch will delve into all the associated environmental and policy issues, from forest management to insurance regulation and utility liability.
Paluch earned her bachelor's degree in Chinese Studies from Washington University in St. Louis, and her master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. She has worked overseas as a staff reporter for the Myanmar Times in Yangon, Myanmar, and Voice of America in Bangkok, Thailand, and as a freelance correspondent for media organizations including the Los Angeles Times, the Guardian and the South China Morning Post.
In 2016, she was an Overseas Press Club Fellow with Associated Press in Thailand. Her work has also appeared in the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Paluch was one of the lead reporters on a McClatchy series about a Kazakh money laundering scandal with ties to President Trump. The stories won a Best in Business Award from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers in 2017. She starts in Palm Springs on Monday.
Also joining the newsroom Monday is summer intern Kaylee Beam. Beam, who hails from Rancho Cucamonga, graduated this month from Stanford University with a bachelor of science degree in Atmosphere/Energy Studies. In the fall, she will return to Palo Alto to pursue her master's degree in in Earth Systems and Environmental Communication.
Beam joins intern Bryana Quintana, who started at The Desert Sun last week. Quintana is a student at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. She's written for the school magazine North by Northwestern and last summer was an intern at KESQ. She is a native of the Coachella Valley and played tennis at Xavier Prep. She will be working with our arts and culture team.
And as previously announced, Brian Blueskye has joined The Desert Sun as an arts and culture reporter and begins work Monday as well. A 15-year resident of the valley, he has written for the CV Independent for the last six years.
Stay tuned for more new faces in the coming months, as we bring on a reporter in Sacramento and a new business writer.

Online Survey
Dear Readers,
In an effort to better know and understand our readers, The Desert Sun and our sister paper the Ventura County Star have partnered with a team of researchers at Louisiana State, Colorado State and Texas A&M universities to survey our audiences about their attitudes and interest in local news and opinion content.
We invite both subscribers and non-subscribers to participate in this online survey, which will take about 10 minutes to complete and was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Louisiana State, which oversees academic studies to ensure that they are ethically designed and administered. The researchers are seeking 500 respondents in each market. Go online to take the survey: https://tinyurl.com/DesertSunReaderSurvey
The survey results will be compiled by the researchers: Dr. Joshua Darr, assistant professor of Political Communication at LSU (jdarr@lsu.edu), Dr. Johanna Dunaway, associate professor of communication at Texas A&M (jdunaway@tamu.edu), and Dr. Matthew Hitt, an assistant professor of political science at Colorado State (matthew.hitt@colostate.edu). The survey is anonymous, and no individual responses will be shared with either The Desert Sun or the VC Star.
Once the study is complete, we pledge to share with you the results of the research, hopefully by late summer.
Thank you for helping to help us make The Desert Sun a better publication for you.
Paluch
Beam
Quintana
Blueskye
There will be some new faces at The Desert Sun soon, Executive Editor Julie Makinen writes.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: RIVIERA BEACH — The security system for the computers that hold all the city’s vital data was so outdated the company that made it didn’t even service it anymore, Riviera Beach’s interim information technology manager, Justin Williams, told the City Council on Feb. 20.
“Our current backup system is more susceptible to security concerns and ransomware viruses,” he said, urging them to replace it.
By a 5-0 vote, they consented, authorizing the purchase of a new system for $798,419.
But it was never installed.
And May 29, when someone in the Police Department opened an email infected with
ransomware, the entire system went down. Email, down. Phones, down. Police records, ditto. Public Works, City Attorney’s Office, Library, offline. Three weeks later, it’s still not fully operational.
On Monday, the council authorized the city insurer to pay 65 bitcoins, valued at roughly $600,000, in hopes the ransomers would provide a decoding key to regain access to the data. As of Friday: Still no data, and a dearth of public information about the attack, as the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service investigated.
In Riviera Beach, the hackers found a vulnerable target: a government struggling through years of management turmoil, and a City Hall filled with interim department heads, including the interim IT manager, the city’s second in a row, and an interim city manager, third in a row. A series of scandals led voters to oust four of five City Council members and the mayor, so only one person on that decision-making board has been in office more than a year-and-a-half.
FBI advised against paying the ransom
The city used to have a computer security contract but the previous interim IT manager didn’t know about it. When the issue came up last fall, he discovered the contract had elapsed, according to one insider.
That set in motion the bureaucratic process to select a contractor, seek council authorization to pay for a new system, have the Purchasing Department order it (that step alone took more than a month) and to receive it (it arrived in late April, early May) and install it (almost).
Nine months after the city awoke to the fact that it was operating unprotected amid a highly publicized, nationwide barrage of ransomware attacks, the system is being put in place.
The old data storage units were purchased in 2012 and had a 5-to-12 year lifespan, Williams told the council at its Feb. 20 meeting. “The devices are past their useful life.”
Buying new storage and backup systems would save the city time and money in the long run and protect its reputation, he added.
Instead that reputation took another hit, as the New York Times, CNN, NBC, NPR and other national media picked up on the tale of the coastal city of 35,000 residents, 22 percent of them below poverty level, that agreed to a $600,000 ransom demand.
The payout came against the advice of the FBI and of many of the city’s top officials, who felt the lost data was not worth the lofty price. The FBI, whose website has a section dedicated to ransomware issues, advocates against paying ransom, because payment doesn’t guarantee a city will get its data back and creates an incentive for more crime.
“It was a difficult decision for me,” said Council Chairwoman KaShamba Miller-Anderson, an assistant principal at Bear Lakes Middle School in West Palm Beach. Noting that she was limited in what she could say because of the investigation, she said she considered all the views expressed and in the end decided it was important the city regain access to its data.
What made the decision hard was that, not only was she not versed in computer security issues, but she didn’t know how much confidence she could have in what city staffers and others were telling her, considering the perpetually transitional state of the city government.
“I have a hard time trusting,” she said. “It’s frustrating. There are a lot of moving parts and you’re relying on other people to give you the information and you don’ know who is who. I don’t want to waste money or lose public records.”
Did political turmoil play a part?
The city’s political turmoil, seldom far from the surface, stirred in 2017, after the council fired one city manager, moved an existing employee up to interim manager, then passed over him for the permanent position, a move that divided the council.
The man who they hired to fill that post, in March 2017, Jonathan Evans, proved a popular reformer. But after only six months on the job, the council fired him in a surprise 3-2 vote. And as months went by, the divided council went through one interim manager after another, unable to agree on a new one, or even on what qualifications a candidate should be required to have.
Meanwhile a series of scandals unfolded, reported in The Palm Beach Post. The city was shown to be paying council members inordinate amounts for expenses, travel, car allowances and stipends. It was providing health insurance to former employees, including a dead one, for years after they had left the city. Many key jobs in the government went unfilled.
Anti-incumbent sentiment led voters to oust most of the council. The new council recently rehired Evans, hoping to right the government. He is scheduled to take office in mid-July.
But in the midst of all this, cybercriminals were launching ransomware attacks across the country.
More than 50 cities across the United States have been hit during the past two years. Among them: Atlanta; Baltimore; Albany, N.Y.; Greenville, N.C.; Imperial County, Calif.; Cleveland, Ohio; Augusta, Maine; Lynn, Mass.; Cartersville, Ga.; and in April, nearby Stuart.
The Palm Beach County village of Palm Springs was hit in 2018, paid an undisclosed amount to ransom but nonetheless lost two years of data, according to one source who asked not to be identified.
Village Manager Rich Reade and his IT managers did not return calls about the attack. But after it was revealed Wednesday in The Palm Beach Post, Reade told a reporter for local TV station CBS12 that the city ended up hiring an outside firm for $70,000 to recover from the attack.
Stuart City Manager David Dyess said Friday that his city was part-way through upgrading its computer security in April when its techs discovered its old system had been infected. Ransomers demanded payment in bitcoin, in an amount Dyess said he could not disclose.
Some servers had to be rebuilt from scratch but the cost wasn’t worth paying any ransom, he said. “We were fortunate in fact we had a viable backup we could restore from. We also had new hardware and a new server.”
For every city or company, whether to pay is “really a business decision,” Dyess said. “If you are able to recover, then you do your best to recover without paying.”
Ransomware attacks are “probably more common than you see in the news,” said Wesley McGrew, of Memphis, Tenn.-based Horne Cyber. The firm helps companies negotiate lower ransom payments but recommends cities not pay. “It’s very rare that the value of the information exceeds the ransom itself,” he said.
The FBI recommends cities focus on prevention, by training employees in computer awareness and installing good enough technical equipment and software to defend themselves. It’s also important to create a business continuity plan, in event of an attack, the bureau says.
Communities throughout the county have taken note.
Palm Beach Gardens is among those who take the threat seriously, IT Director Eric Holdt said.
“We maintain a very aggressive posture and have many layers of security to protect our systems,” he said. “We keep our software consistently updated to the latest versions and conduct ongoing staff training for cyber awareness.” That includes sending out its own test emails to see if employees do the right thing, and providing remedial training for those who fail to recognize the simulated attacks.
Jupiter replaces 20 percent of the town’s work stations each year, regularly applying the latest Microsoft patches and ensuring the strength of antivirus protection for town email addresses, Director of Information Services Karl Craig said.
In Riviera Beach, Chairwoman Miller-Anderson said she didn’t know why the new system approved by the council in February wasn’t installed by late May. She said she has asked interim City Manager Deirdre Jacobs to find out.
Riviera Beach’s interim IT manager, Williams, did not return a request for comment. Nor did Jacobs.

Abolish the Death Penalty?

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "When We Kill," by Nicholas Kristof (column, June 16):
I served as a juror in a felony murder case. In the end, there was no question that the accused did, in fact, brutally slit the throat of an elderly woman and let her bleed to death in front of her lifelong partner. Being on that jury was the hardest thing I have ever done -- to have to accept the reality that sitting 10 feet from me was a human being capable of such an inhuman act.
But would I have voted for the death penalty had it been an option (it no longer was in my state)? No. Why not? Simple: He was a killer. I am not.
Jim McKean
Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
To the Editor:
I admire Nicholas Kristof immensely and usually agree with his opinions. However, I think he is wrong about the death penalty, not in his criticisms necessarily, but in his campaign to abolish rather than remedy. There are crimes so horrendous and indisputable (serial killings, Charles Manson) that make untenable the arguments for keeping their perpetrators alive at public expense.
I submit to Mr. Kristof that the process could be so clearly improved that instead of an error rate of 4 to 5 percent, properly horrifying and inexcusable, the rate could be reduced to a fraction of 1 percent, still horrifying but inevitable, and acceptable, in any system involving humans.
There should be a five-person sub-Supreme Court devoted solely to death penalty cases, with a staff sufficient to investigate them, to question prosecution and defense, to uncover not just prosecutorial misconduct (which we know to be too common), but also any information that is exculpatory or mitigating. Or to find a case airtight, beyond question.
That would largely resolve the problems of both excessive delay and excessive expense in litigating capital offenses, not to mention excessive error. I agree with Mr. Kristof that, as currently rendered, many death sentences are cruel, sometimes barbaric. I disagree that it must always be so, that capital punishment cannot be administered much more carefully and fairly.
Andrew Fitch
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
To the Editor:
As a conservative and a practicing Catholic, I find there is little Nicholas Kristof and I usually agree on. However, I am in complete agreement with his position that the death penalty is barbaric. As he points out, the death penalty is neither a deterrent nor less costly than life imprisonment.
As a Catholic I am pro-life, and as such I cannot condone the death penalty. For me, there is little difference between abortion and the death penalty. Both result in the taking of a life. A distinction without a difference.
Gerard J. Cassedy Jr.
Ponte Vedra, Fla.
To the Editor:
Grateful thanks to Nicholas Kristof for his thorough and compassionate column on the injustice of capital punishment. My father, Harry Blackmun, delayed announcing his retirement as associate justice of the Supreme Court in order not to distract from his January 1994 dissent in Callins v. Collins.
Here is what he wrote:
"From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored -- indeed, I have struggled, along with a majority of this Court -- to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. ... Rather than continue to coddle the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed."
Nancy Blackmun
Needham, Mass.
To the Editor:
After carefully reading Nicholas Kristof's piece, I respectfully disagree with him. I grew up in the heart of the Ted Bundy years, and several of my neighbors were murdered by him (I did not know them personally). He murdered at least 30 young women -- perhaps as many as 100 -- most savagely.
When I heard about his execution, it was like lancing a boil. He destroyed the lives of more people than just his victims and never once shed a tear of remorse.
As a progressive independent voter, I am still firmly for the death penalty. It is people like Ted Bundy who have galvanized my belief. To be blunt, the death penalty is a form of societal revenge.
Doug Leen
Petersburg, Alaska
To the Editor:
I only wish Nicholas Kristof had extended his excellent article to criticize the death by incarceration with which some states (including New York) have heedlessly replaced the death penalty. The "life without parole" sentences now handed out more and more frequently condemn thousands of people to a slow but inevitable death behind bars, in brutal, cruel conditions that are now coming to public attention. As these sentences become more common, they will keep feeding the crisis of mass incarceration.
The answer is not just to remove the death penalty but to transform our thinking and our system to reflect the reality that everyone can change, that most people at age 50 are far different from who we were at 18, 19 or even 30, and that long sentences serve no purpose other than promoting vengeance and violence and filling our prisons with people whose incarceration does nothing to promote public health and safety.
Laura Whitehorn
New York
The writer is a co-founder of Release Aging People in Prison.
To the Editor:
A comment in Nicholas Kristof's death penalty piece irritates me. He mentions that Clifford Williams Jr. had "a public defender," insinuating that because his attorney was employed by a public defender office, that attorney's work was sloppy and contributed to Mr. Williams's conviction. Mr. Williams probably had a bad attorney, but his legal representation wasn't bad just because he had a "public defender." To condemn the work done by the thousands of overworked and underpaid public defenders in this country in one broad brush stroke is egregious.
As a criminal defense attorney, working for the Minnesota Office of the Public Defender, for nearly 25 years, I saw many intelligent, dedicated, skilled and hard-working criminal defense attorneys who represent indigent clients for a public defender office. I heard over and over from trial court judges that if that judge ever had a need for a criminal defense attorney, a public defender would be the first choice.
Mr. Williams's conviction was tragic and may indeed have been the result of his attorney's work (or lack thereof). But don't sensationalize his story with a blanket condemnation of public defenders.
Barbara Deneen
St. Paul
To the Editor:
The death penalty should always be an option until there's nobody left who deserves it. In the meantime, a life sentence is not enough for creatures like Ted Bundy. Beyond retribution, even life without parole offers no guarantee of continued incarceration. All it takes is one ideology-driven lawyer or documentarian crafty enough to make the case a cause célèbre and suddenly the victims' families get to spend the rest of their lives going to hearings, or, worse, see their loved ones' killer ennobled and released on a technicality.
The only credible argument against capital punishment is the possibility of wrongful conviction, and our legal system needs to do a better job preventing that, regardless of the sentence. As for the expense, the reason executions cost more than imprisonment is that they're worth it.
Gary Taustine
New York
To the Editor:
Many New York Times articles have given me food for thought, but none have forced me to completely discard a long-held stance -- until now. Nicholas Kristof's "When We Kill" makes it impossible for me to retain the comfortable fantasy that the death penalty serves a purpose. Mr. Kristof's many examples of wrongly convicted inmates show that the death penalty does not protect society from dangerous psychopaths. It simply exacerbates the already horrific injustices in our criminal justice system.

Family secrets: Which to keep and others to share

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection.

Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.

Texto completo: Family secrets, every family has them. But should your estate plan be one of those secrets?
In my law practice, I am often asked by parents if they should provide a copy of their estate planning documents to their adult child(ren), or at least discuss the plan with them. And the typical lawyer answer I give is “it depends.” And it does.
It depends on the ages of those folks; whether you’re likely to make significant changes in the future; if there is anything unusual in your plan; whether anyone is being disinherited or inheriting less than what they might expect; and your relationship with the heirs and beneficiaries in general.
There are, however, some general rules.
What not to keep secret
Someone besides you (and your spouse, if applicable) should know where your documents are stored.
By the time your will, trust, health care directive, or power of attorney is needed, you are either deceased or incapacitated, so you won’t be available to hand over keys or combinations or directions to your secret storage spot.
Generally, it’s not a good idea to keep your documents in a bank safe deposit box either — access to these is notoriously difficult and they can’t be reached as quickly as may be needed in an emergency.
Your heirs and beneficiaries should know which attorney drafted your documents and how to reach them.
It’s a good idea to inform your heirs who you’ve put in charge when you’re gone. The trustee of your trust will have immediate duties and responsibilities. It’s good for them to be aware of their role ahead of time so they are prepared and willing to act.
The job of trustee is a big one — it’s not necessarily an “honor.” Thus, let them all know whom you’ve selected and why. You might find out the person you chose doesn’t want to serve, or the others object to that choice for very valid reasons.
I once had a client choose one child as trustee because the other four children “liked” that child. But during the family meeting to review the plan with all the children, it became clear that while they may have liked that child, they did not respect him. We could all see he wasn’t likely to act fairly either. Luckily, it was also apparent there was one child they all did respect. We made the change immediately.
If you are disinheriting a child or leaving one child less than the others, it’s generally a good idea to make that known ahead of time as well as your reasons for doing so. If you aren’t comfortable telling that child directly, let your attorney and your other children, and perhaps a trusted friend or adviser, know your reasons for the disinheritance. You may be able to avoid a costly fight later.
Secrets you might keep
You may want to keep the dispositive provisions of your estate plan (i.e. who gets what and when) confidential. Your children don’t need to know if you’ve left a charitable gift in addition to what you’ve left them, or how much you have, or that you’ve left the grandchildren something as well. Those things often change over time.
If you’re concerned about the spending habits of the spouse of one of your children, or the possibility of a child divorcing, you can arrange for that child’s share to be held in trust to maintain its separate property status (in California). That might be awkward to bring up at a family dinner, so you don’t have to go into details. You can simply let your child know you’ve provided for them in a trust that will give them creditor protection. (“Creditor” includes future ex-spouses, but doesn’t “creditor protection” sound so much nicer?).
Your list of assets and liabilities isn’t something anyone needs to know currently. But there should be a list (often it’s attached to your trust) and contact information readily available so that the trustee or agent acting under a power of attorney can spring into action when needed.
Many times I’ve seen family members struggle to find out where the bank accounts are, whether there was a mortgage on the house, and if there was any insurance, for weeks and months, which causes a delay in the entire administration process and unnecessary stress during an already stressful time.
Don’t take it to the grave
Finally, you’d be doing your family members a great favor if you talked about your wishes for end-of-life care and memorial services. It’s a difficult topic, but an important one. Talk about whether you want to be an organ donor, your desires for pain medication, life support and CPR.
If you prefer cremation or burial, let your loved ones know. The more plans you make on your own, including pre-paid burial arrangements, and share with your loved ones, the less their burden will be when they are grieving your loss. They’ll be able to focus on celebrating you and your life, your final gift to them.

Texto completo: La sonda de exploración de la NASA en Marte, Curiosity, acaba de descubrir un gas que podría probar la existencia de vida en el Planeta Rojo.
Según The New York Times, Curiosity descubrió elevadas cantidades de gas metano en el aire el miércoles , lo que podría ser un signo de microbios que viven en el planeta marciano.
Los datos llegaron a los científicos de la NASA el jueves y causaron tanta emoción que se realizarán experimentos durante todo el fin de semana para obtener más resultados.
En la Tierra, el metano generalmente es producido por seres vivos, por lo que los científicos teorizan que el metano detectado en Marte podría llevar al descubrimiento de vida extraterrestre.
Por ahora, la NASA le ha ordenado a Curiosity que ponga todas sus otras tareas en un segundo plano, mientras continúa examinando las áreas donde se registró el metano.
Los científicos esperan que los hallazgos regresen a la Tierra el lunes para que puedan comenzar a analizar y realizar determinaciones adicionales.
Curiosity se encargó de buscar metano cuando inicialmente aterrizó en Marte en 2012, y al año siguiente se produjo un pequeño aumento de presencia del gas, que pronto se disipó.
Las lecturas recientes son aparentemente 3 veces más altas que las primeras, por lo que los científicos están entusiasmados con las posibles implicaciones.
La sonda Curiosity se lanzó inicialmente desde Cabo Cañaveral el 26 de noviembre de 2011.
Lo que comenzó como una misión de 2 años se extendió indefinidamente en 2012.
Los objetivos de la sonda incluyen investigar el clima y la geología de Marte, y también evaluar si el ambiente dentro del cráter Gale ha sido siempre el mejor para la vida microbiana.
Curiosity también investiga el papel de los estudios de agua y habitabilidad, ya que la NASA y otras agencias espaciales se preparan para enviar humanos a colonizar en el planeta.

Texto completo: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - President Donald Trump on Friday described a nail-biting decision to call off an imminent attack on Iran in order to avoid disproportionate casualties, but the account is already facing scrutiny from aides around him and military analysts questioning the sequence of events he laid out in tweets and statements.
Early in the day, the president said he called off the counterattack at the last minute because it would kill 150 people in retaliation for the downing of an unmanned surveillance drone. "We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die," he tweeted.
But administration officials said Trump was told earlier Thursday how many casualties could occur if a strike on Iran was carried out, and that he had given the green light to prepare for the operation Thursday morning.
The confusion reinforced concerns about the Trump administration's credibility at a time when key U.S. allies are already questioning its narrative about Iran's culpability for a recent spate of attacks on oil tankers.
Iran said Friday that the United States had "no justification" for a retaliatory strike and vowed to respond "firmly" to any U.S. military action.
Trump's morning tweets appeared to gloss over the fact that he was the one, as commander in chief, who had ordered the retaliation against Iran in the first place.
Trump administration officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security decisions, said the president approved the strikes after Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier in the day shot down the Navy RQ-4 Global Hawk, a move Trump described as a "very big mistake."
But he later changed his mind, the officials said. The decision was first reported by the New York Times.
The commander of the Revolutionary Guard's aerospace division said Friday that Iran had sent "warnings" to the drone before shooting it down. In an interview with Iran's state-controlled broadcaster, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh said a final warning was sent at 3:55 a.m. local time Thursday.
"When it did not redirect its route and continued flying toward and into our territory, we had to shoot it at 4:05 a.m.," he said. "Our national security is a red line."
He said Iran refrained from also shooting down a U.S. P-8 patrol aircraft, with 35 people on board, that he asserted had accompanied the drone into Iranian airspace. His claim could not immediately be verified.
A senior U.S. defense official said Friday morning that the Pentagon had Navy assets poised to strike in Iran if directed, including ships accompanying the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. Those attacks could have included airstrikes with jets, or - more likely - Tomahawk cruise missiles, the official said.
Trump's initial tweets suggested that he had canceled his own order: "10 minutes before the strike I stopped it," he said. But in an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd for "Meet the Press," the president said he hadn't given final approval to any strikes and that no planes were in the air.
"Nothing was green lighted until the very end because things change," Trump said in the interview.
In his Twitter posts Friday morning, Trump wrote that "sanctions are biting & more added last night." However, the Treasury Department did not add any new sanctions against Iran on Thursday night.
There was also confusion about how the United States and Iran were communicating during the crisis at a time when the two adversaries have very few diplomatic contacts.
The Reuters news agency reported Friday that Iranian officials said they received a message from Trump through Oman overnight warning that a U.S. attack was imminent.
When asked about the report, a senior U.S. administration official said the United States never sent a message to Iran via the Omanis. The country at the eastern corner of the Arabian peninsula has long been an interlocutor between the West and Iran, but not on this occasion, the official said.
"It is a complete lie and propaganda from Iran," the official said.
Earlier Friday, the head of Iranian media services also told NBC News that the Reuters report was inaccurate. He said such a message from the United States was never sent and the content of the messages is also false.
The Federal Aviation Administration late Thursday barred U.S.-registered aircraft from operating over the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, due to an increase in military activities and political tensions that it said might "place commercial flights at risk."
Several U.S. and international carriers said that they had either canceled flights over Iranian airspace or were taking steps to avoid the Strait of Hormuz.
The day's events have left lawmakers in both parties confused about whether the United States remains on the precipice of a military conflict or if an imminent crisis had been averted.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that she was not informed of Trump's plans to strike Iran but described the latest events as a "dangerous, high-tension situation."

Texto completo: I keep trying to find the perfect place to read. Unfortunately I'm like a dog, restless and roaming. I move around, depending on the weather, the time of the day, who is in the room and, of course, what I am reading, because what I am reading dictates everything.
I hate to stop reading novels once I have started, so I save them for places and times when nothing can ruin the experience. Realistically, that means it is best to read in bed, through the night. (Luckily I am married to someone who insists the light doesn't bother him.)
Once I've settled in, I read until I've finished the book or just can't keep my eyes open. It might be 2 or 3 a.m. There will be no texts or news alerts, and I won't be tempted to check my phone. (If I don't finish, I'll read in the morning and make some excuse that I'm in meetings to whoever is looking for me.)

Most nonfiction I read on the window seat in the kitchen of my home in Brookhaven Hamlet, a small village on the eastern end of Long Island. I sometimes say I write or exercise in the morning, but that is a lie. Here is the actual truth of my morning routine: I make warm lemon juice and set it on a stool that I have pulled next to the window seat from under the island. (It's a great cheap metal knockoff of one I saw at Copper Beech, an idyllic food and home furnishings store that opened in nearby Bellport two years ago.) Phone in hand, I settle into the window seat to continue reading all the news I didn't get to when I picked up the phone on waking.
Depending on the season, I am under a light blanket from Target or a voluminous furry one from West Elm. I read standard news-junkie fare -- the New York Times, the Financial Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Axios, Politico, Pacific Standard, etc. -- and then, depressed, I will make breakfast. Before I get to work, it is back to the window seat with tea for a brief run at a nonfiction book, currently rotating between "The Undoing Project" by Michael Lewis, a tale of a long-standing friendship and collaboration between two Israeli professors, and "Cuz: The Life and Times of Michael A.," by Danielle Allen, a memoir about the author's once-promising cousin -- arrested at 15, jailed for 11 years, murdered at 29.
If it is really cold, I migrate 10 feet to sit in front of the gas fire on a sofa I inherited from my stepmother, covered for 50 years in still-functional crewel fabric. I hide upstairs if there are people around and stretch out on the wicker chaise in my office, which sounds comfortable but isn't. I always seem to be sliding, due to a mistaken fabric choice.
In the evening, after some compulsively watchable television like "The French Village," I often read books about health and science. By my bed right now is the "The Longevity Diet" by Valter Longo, director of the USC Longevity Institute, which I read and reread, probably because my family history is more notable for lots of drinking and eating than for longevity. Longo explains the science behind intermittent fasting without being simplistic, showing how restricting food to a shorter time frame in the day helps regenerate cells. Because of Longo, unless I'm at a dinner party, I don't eat after 7 p.m. or before 10 a.m. the next day.
Does it work? Who knows? As of this writing, yes.

Around 1 a.m. on Wednesday, as our producers listened to tape of voters waiting in line for a rally, everybody working on that morning's episode had the same sobering epiphany: Here we go again.
The 2020 campaign is truly, inescapably underway.
Until now, "The Daily" has deliberately taken a slow and spare approach to the 2020 election. Campaigns are voracious -- they have a way of crowding out the rest of the news. But voters won't cast a ballot for another 500 days. Why rush?
On Tuesday, when President Trump announced his re-election campaign, it felt like a turning point. There are now 23 declared candidates for the Democratic nomination and two declared Republicans. Democratic primary debates begin next week.
The slow and spare approach is about to change.
***
A former editor of mine, Dick Stevenson, likes to distinguish between what he calls "The Campaign" (the candidates, their message, their standing) and "The Election" (the voters, their hopes and anxieties, how they see the candidates).
We're looking to find new ways to cover both.
We need to meet and understand the candidates. But just as important, we need to meet and understand the voters.
***
Wednesday's episode was an experiment in weaving together those two forms of coverage, The Campaign and The Election. It began with the White House reporter Maggie Haberman exploring the role of Trump's freewheeling and grievance-filled rallies in his 2016 political rise. It then pivoted to conversations with his supporters as they stood outside an arena in Florida on Tuesday afternoon, waiting to hear the president kick off his re-election campaign. It ended with Maggie's analysis of that night's rally.
The rally didn't start until 8 p.m. -- a logistical challenge for us. So we recorded Part 1, about the history of the president's rallies, in the afternoon. Maggie and our colleague Annie Karni then fanned out to speak with voters at the rally for Part 2, recording their exchanges on their iPhones and emailing them back to New York. Shortly after the rally was over, after 10 p.m., we interviewed Maggie again about what she had just witnessed for Part 3 of the episode.
***
Somewhere along the way, we discovered audio gold. Maggie had recorded a short audio file of herself inside the arena, describing her surroundings for listeners. But moments before she began speaking, her recorder caught the unmistakable sound of Frank Sinatra singing "My Way" over the arena's loudspeakers. Back in New York, the producers Alexandra Young and Michael Simon Johnson had an idea: Use "My Way" as a transition into our theme music. The result was something new for our show opening.

Have you ever been to a political rally?
Wednesday's episode took us to the president's re-election rally, an event that reminded Maggie Haberman how "fundamentally new" Donald Trump's rallies felt, with their unscripted deliveries, in the run-up to 2016. But rallies have long been a cornerstone of political campaigns.

What we're listening to
Who: Andy Mills, producer for "The Daily"
What: "Making Sense" with Sam Harris, #160: The Revenge of History
For many of my growing-up years, I was a religious fundamentalist. I had firm -- and, I thought, unwavering -- beliefs about the world and the cosmos that were shaped by my community and my experiences.
At some point during my time at a religious university, I started to encounter all sorts of views that I'd never heard or deeply considered before. I met folks of other faiths. I met folks with wildly different political opinions. And, as it turns out, their views were often shaped by their communities and experiences too.
All these echo-chamber-bursting experiences -- I loved them. That's how I went from a life committed to preaching dogma to one committed to staying curious about what people believe and why. And one of my favorite things about podcasts is how they've allowed me to listen in on all sorts of views that I'd never get to hear otherwise.
The podcast I'm recommending this week, "Making Sense," is one of them. I don't always or even often agree with the views of the host, Sam Harris, and his guests. But I'm grateful for the way they relentlessly try to figure out how belief works.
This particular episode is a conversation about the global rise of populism (which has been on my mind in light of last week's "Daily" series on the European Union). The episode features Yascha Mounk, one of the few people to predict the present political moment years before it arrived. Mounk is fascinating to listen to because he's both a scholar who has researched the history of populism and a journalist who has actually traveled the world speaking to populist leaders and their supporters. But what I especially value is how Mounk goes beyond just talking about what people say they believe, and instead tries to shine a light on how and why they came to believe it.

On "The Daily" this week
■ The bill that set off some of the largest demonstrations in Hong Kong's history has been suspended. Austin Ramzy on why protesters are still marching.
■ David Sanger explains how American attacks on Russia's power grid are renewing questions about what's fair in cyberwar.
■ Maggie Haberman on the president's re-election rally: "He had this delicate line to walk between being the outsider and being the insider. And I think, based on the crowd's reaction, that he was successful at it."
■ The Trump administration is now telling migrants to wait in Mexico. It's a step toward an immigration plan that would fundamentally change how asylum works in the U.S., Zolan Kanno-Youngs tells us.
■ "So far, everything the United States has done has only emboldened Iran to behave even more like a bad actor," Mark Landler says. As tensions escalate, we look at what each side really wants.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The downing of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran was a "very big mistake," President Donald Trump said in a tweet Thursday. But as some Republicans pressed for new steps against the country, Trump played down the incident, noting that the aircraft was not carrying any Americans.
The attack on the Navy RQ-4 drone heightened fears that the U.S. and Iran are on a course toward a military conflict as each side blamed the other. The New York Times reported Thursday night that Trump approved a retaliatory strike to take place this morning but abruptly pulled back, according to senior administration officials.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement that it targeted the drone inside Iranian airspace over the southern province of Hormozgan, next to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
But U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, denied that the aircraft had entered Iranian airspace, characterizing the incident as an "unprovoked attack" over one of the world’s most important commercial waterways.
Trump suggested that the attack on the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which has the wingspan of a commercial airliner, may have been carried out without the knowledge of Iranian leaders.
"I’m not just talking about the country made a mistake. I’m talking about somebody under the command of that country made a mistake," Trump said at the White House alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional" on the part of Iran’s top officials, the president said.
Trump was noncommittal about a U.S. counterattack. "Let’s see what happens," he said. "This is a new fly in the ointment — what happened, shooting down the drone — and this country will not stand for it."
The White House invited a bipartisan group of top congressional leaders to a meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the situation. Among those invited were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate intelligence and armed services committees.
"We had a good briefing," McConnell said, adding that he could confirm that an unmanned aerial vehicle "was fired on from Iranian soil and it was in international waters. And beyond that I think the administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses."
Schumer said he cautioned that "these conflicts have a way of escalating."
"The president may not intend to go to war here, but we’re worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war," he said. "One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust open debate and for Congress to have a real say. We learned that lesson in the run-up to Iraq" in 2003.
After the White House meeting, Pelosi held a closed-door session with Democratic lawmakers to brief them on the developments. "We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe," she said.
Thursday’s strike capped a number of recent incidents, including attacks on oil tankers, that American officials have depicted as part of an Iranian effort to hurt the United States and its allies in the region. The attack on the drone comes as the United States continues its "maximum pressure" campaign against a country the Trump administration has identified as its main adversary in the Middle East.
Tehran has responded with defiance to the initiative, which was launched after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and has included designating the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and taking steps to cut off Iranian oil sales.
On Thursday, the European Union said officials from Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran would meet next week to discuss strategies to salvage the nuclear pact despite renewed U.S. sanctions and Tehran’s threat to exceed limits on its uranium stockpiles.
The Revolutionary Guard’s top commander, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, called the downing of the drone "a clear message to America."
"Our borders are Iran’s red line, and we will react strongly against any aggression," Salami said in remarks carried by Iranian state television. "Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."
Nearly a quarter of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects Middle East energy producers to markets around the globe.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Global Hawk was flying at high altitude in the vicinity of recent tanker attacks and was not at any time closer than 21 miles to the nearest point on Iran’s coast.
Guastella said the aircraft did not leave international airspace and was brought down by an IRGC surface-to-air missile fired from an area close to Goruk, Iran. "This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE, and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," he said. Guastella did not take questions.
The Global Hawk incident occurs the week after two tankers, a Japanese and a Norwegian, were attacked in the area of the Gulf of Oman. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for both incidents, at least one of which is said to have been carried out by use of a limpet mine similar to devices previously displayed at Iranian military parades.

Restricting abortion is actually good for business

Texto completo: Recently, in a high-profile move that garnered significant media attention, chief executives from 187 companies, including Twitter, Warby Parker, and Yelp, signed onto a letter declaring that abortion restrictions are “bad for business.”
Appearing as a full-page ad in the New York Times, the declaration trotted out all the usual tropes, lies, and euphemisms popular among the pro-abortion crowd.
“When everyone is empowered to succeed, our companies, our communities and our economy are better for it,” the ad states. “Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers. Simply put, it goes against our values and is bad for business. It impairs our ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent across the states and protect the well-being of all the people who keep our businesses thriving day in and out.”
The letter concludes: “The future of gender equality hangs in the balance, putting our families, communities, businesses and the economy at risk.”
Setting aside my own moral and theological opposition to abortion for a moment, the logic at the center of the group’s main argument — that restricting abortion is “bad for business” — makes no sense at all. For at the heart of free-market capitalism is the critical need for both creators and consumers who have the intelligence, skills, and resources to develop, deliver, and purchase goods.
Simply put, companies fail without customers. Economics 101 suggests that the larger the pool of people from which to pull, the more product and profit will be produced. And abortion doesn’t add people to the population; it only subtracts.
Just consider the numbers and the math. An estimated 60 million preborn babies have died since the Supreme Court legalized abortion in all 50 states back in 1973. That number is mind-blowing, especially when you realize it’s as high as the combined current populations of California and New York, two of the largest states in America.
By extremely conservative estimates, taking into consideration geographic and educational disparities, the average American will still earn more than $1 million over the course of his or her lifetime. Multiplied by the 60 million people aborted since 1973, that means over $60 trillion in value has been lost from our economy: a sum so staggering that it’s impossible for the average person to mentally quantify it. For perspective, the U.S. economy is roughly $20 trillion annually.
So, the question that begs an answer is why companies who covet and compete for customers would willingly and enthusiastically sabotage the very pipeline needed for their business to succeed?
Of course, abortion at its core is an illogical evil. Killing nearly 1 million innocent babies each year, when nearly as many couples are waiting to adopt, is unfathomable and illogical. But the abortion lobby is relentless, tireless, and well-funded. I suspect many titans of industry are intimidated by their tactics and fear the economic blowback they think will follow if they don’t bow or bend at the altar of the abortion empire. But the numbers suggest this fear is overblown.
Polls confirm that Americans are increasingly uncomfortable with radical policies and legislation that take innocent preborn life. I think corporations would be pleasantly surprised how enthusiastically a pro-life embrace would be met by the sometimes-silent majority that constitutes their customer base.
I intend to meet with corporate leaders in the coming weeks and months to help persuade them to embrace the next generation and work out ways those businesses can help mothers and their children whose choose life instead of abortion. This would be especially appropriate for corporations like Disney, whose customer base is children.
There’s an old saying that goodwill is the first law of good business, an intangible asset that’s needed for any long-term capitalistic success. Never is this truer than in the case of businesses that wisely embrace their future customers, especially those on the brink of birth.
Jim Daly is the president of Focus on the Family.

Texto completo: WI Staff Report
Recent studies suggest that African women face greater risk of HIV infection upon using an injectable birth control, a hormone shot known as Depo-Provera.
The shot provides an opportunity to discreetly avoid pregnancy for a period of about three months. Due to societal pressures from both families and partners desiring children, most African men refuse to use condoms.
These shots are quite popular in areas where HIV is prevalent and, in some cases, is the only form of contraception available for women as opposed to other options like intrauterine devices, also known as IUDs or the pill.
A recent study, Evidence for Contraceptive Options and HIV Outcomes, involved 7.800 women in four African countries (South Africa, Kenya, Zambia and eSwatini (formerly Swaziland), presented relieving results for health care providers showing that while Depo-Provera appeared to have minimally higher risk of HIV infection than other forms of contraception.
However, the results were not significant enough to prove that the birth-control shots method is completely dangerous or should be stopped completely.
The study has proved controversial with concerns that it would instead cause more harm than good as more women could possibly become infected with the HIV virus. It compared infections rates among the women over an 18-month period. Each woman was required to use one of the three most modern forms of birth control during that time. While the study was deemed well executed and the study quite helpful in its results, physicians remain concerned about opting for birth control shots over much safer options.
In an interview with the New York Times, Dr. Lauren Ralph, an epidemiologist at the University of California, said she hoped the debate would continue and not be quickly settled in favor injectable hormones.
The World Health Organization plans to review the studies within the next month and decide whether or not to promote the use of injectable hormones as the top-rated safest contraception, a rating that other more traditional forms of contraception currently hold.

Texto completo: New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger fired back at President Trump for accusing the newspaper of committing a "virtual act of treason."
Sulzberger responded to the accusation in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published on Tuesday. The Gray Lady's executive said Trump’s attack "crossed a dangerous line" for criticizing the press.
"There is no more serious charge a commander in chief can make against an independent news organization," Sulzberger wrote.
The newspaper publisher said he fears that Trump's attacks, if they continue to escalate, may lead to "action" against the press and individual journalists. To emphasize that point, Sulzberger intentionally placed his op-ed in a competing paper to show solidarity with the press generally, according to Times spokesman Danielle Rhoades Ha.
"Over 167 years, through 33 presidential administrations, the Times has sought to serve America and its citizens by seeking the truth and helping people understand the world. There is nothing we take more seriously than doing this work fairly and accurately, even when we are under attack," Sulzberger said.
"Mr. Trump's campaign against journalists should concern every patriotic American. A free, fair and independent press is essential to our country's strength and vitality and to every freedom that makes it great," Sulzberger concluded.
Trump's accusation came after the Times published an article on Saturday revealing that the United States is ramping up cyberattacks on Russia. Trump responded calling the report treasonous and said it was not true.
"Do you believe that the Failing New York Times just did a story stating that the United States is substantially increasing Cyber Attacks on Russia. This is a virtual act of Treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story, any story, even if bad for our Country," Trump tweeted after the report was published.
"ALSO, NOT TRUE! Anything goes with our Corrupt News Media today. They will do, or say, whatever it takes, with not even the slightest thought of consequence! These are true cowards and without doubt, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!" Trump said.
Tweet
Sulzberger noted that the Times cleared the article beforehand with the White House National Security Council, the National Security Agency, and the U.S. Cyber Command. None of the agencies had any potential national security concerns about the article.

Texto completo: ALBANY – NXIVM leader Keith Raniere, who surreptitiously led a secret master-slave group whose members were sexually exploited and branded with his initials on their pubic area, was convicted Wednesday of seven felonies in Brooklyn federal court.
A federal jury returned its verdict around 2 p.m. after less than five hours of deliberation.
The verdict followed a wild seven-week trial where jurors heard explicit testimony about Raniere's graphic sexual exploits and how he manipulated the many followers of NXIVM, a purported self-help group based in the Albany area.
For more than two decades, Raniere, who grew up in Suffern, Rockland County, portrayed himself as an all-knowing guru who was once listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as one of the smartest men in the world.
But prosecutors said Raniere, 58, was a fraud. They painted him as a conniving, jealous con man who methodically groomed his followers for sex and was nearly kicked out of college after struggling to keep up his grades.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for New York's Eastern District said Raniere was convicted of all charges, including forced labor conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, sex trafficking and racketeering charges, which included underlying acts of child pornography possession, identity theft and child sexual exploitation, among others.
"His crimes, and the crimes of his co-conspirators, ruined marriages, careers, fortunes and lives," U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a statement.
"The evidence proved that Raniere was truly a modern-day Svengali."
Raniere's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said he plans to appeal.
"Keith maintains his innocence. It's a very sad day for him," Agnifilo said, according to the Associated Press. "I think he's not surprised, but he maintains that he didn't mean to do anything wrong."
Critics long called NXIVM a cult Raniere founded NXIVM in the late 1990s after shutting down his previous business, Consumers Buyline Inc., which had been investigated by several state attorneys general as a pyramid scheme.
NXIVM, which was based in Colonie, Albany County, was billed as a self-help organization. People paid thousands of dollars to take classes based on Raniere's curriculum, but the group quickly and repeatedly faced accusations that it was a cult whose members were manipulated into lionizing Raniere.
The organization built up a series of influential followers, including Clare Bronfman, a wealthy heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune who bankrolled many of Raniere's efforts and lawsuits against detractors.
More recently, Raniere secretly founded DOS, a women's group whose members were known as "slaves" who had to follow orders from their "masters." Most members didn't know Raniere was the top "master."
"Slaves" had to give up damaging collateral — naked photographs, false confessions — in order to join the group, which was billed by leaders, including actress Allison Mack, as an empowerment organization but was used by Raniere to further his sexual interests.
Jurors heard explicit testimony Throughout the lengthy trial, prosecutors detailed how Raniere possessed sexually explicit photographs of one of his followers, who was 15 years old at the time, and how he kept a woman imprisoned in her own home for nearly two years for showing interest in another man.
Jurors heard from a one-time "slave" who was forced to strip naked and wear a blindfold while another woman was told to perform a sex act on her as Raniere watched. The sex act was videotaped.
"Slaves" were told their collateral could be released if they didn't perform the acts ordered by their "master."
Some of the "slaves" were also told to strip naked for an initiation ceremony, where they were branded on their pelvis with a hot cauterizing iron. The brand was a logo that contained the initials of Raniere and Mack, who was a top-level "master."
Mack, 36, who was best known for her role as Chloe Sullivan on the CW's Smallville, pleaded guilty in April to two racketeering felonies. She is due for sentencing in September.
Also pleading guilty for their roles in the criminal enterprise were Bronfman, NXIVM co-founder Nancy Salzman and her daughter, Lauren Salzman, who was a high-ranking NXIVM official.
Victims speak out After the verdict was announced, women who had been victimized by Raniere — some of whom had attended the trial in its entirety — spoke to the media outside the courthouse, thanking the jury for its decision.
Among them were Catherine Oxenberg, the former Dynasty star whose daughter, India, was a member of DOS, and Toni Natalie, a Rochester-area woman whom Raniere harassed with lengthy, expensive lawsuits and legal threats after their eight-year relationship ended in 1999.
Oxenberg and Natalie called themselves "bookends."
Natalie was one of the first people to speak out publicly against Raniere and accuse NXIVM of being a cult, while Oxenberg's decision to speak out in The New York Times in 2017 helped spur the federal investigation that ultimately brought him down.
"She started this, and I finished it," Oxenberg said.
Natalie, who was painted as NXIVM's foremost enemy by Raniere and his inner circle, said that after she and Raniere broke up, he told her she would be "dead or in jail" the next time he saw her.
"Well, I'm alive and he's in jail and it looks like for the rest of his life," Natalie told reporters. "The good guys won today."
Natalie, who attended the entire trial and detailed her story in the Democrat and Chronicle before Raniere was indicted last year, spent years locked in litigation with Raniere and his followers, who challenged her bankruptcy, fought for years-old patents from an old business and forced her to spend thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees.
On Wednesday, Natalie wore a black-and-white striped shirt to wait for the jury's verdict.
She called it her "jail shirt."
"I wore this so he knew what he would be looking at for the rest of his life," Natalie said.

Children swap stories, celebrate differences

Texto completo: The red Russian hardwood trunks with silver bracketing and removable wheels may not look like much, but inside they're packed with adventure and could revolutionize the way students learn. These red trunks are a product of the Red Trunk Project, a program focused on teaching kids about different cultures around the world. While the trunks are literally red, the "red" also stands for "respect every difference."
"The goal is to give kids a deep immersion into one culture and once they do that, they'll have the tools to uncode any other cultures they interact with throughout their life," said the project's founder, Rockland resident Kevin Thomsen.
"Learn to reach out a hand instead of a fist; to build bridges, not walls."
A producer of video games, toys, shows, ebooks and audiobooks who holds a gold record and a couple of Grammys, Thomsen is also a father of two.
"I have two adopted children, one from the Republic of Georgia, Penelope, and Sefan, from Ethiopia," Thomsen said. "For the past 17 years, the idea of keeping kids close to the culture of their birth has stuck with me. How do you introduce kids to a culture without going there? What's the best way to do this?"
The answer: trunks filled with artifacts, video, virtual reality goggles and a booklet.
Teaching through trunks isn't a new concept, but Thomsen wanted to expand on the idea and hyper-focus on a whole country and its culture, as opposed to a moment in history.
"There are people who do trunk-based kinds of things," Thomsen said, "but it's typically one trunk filled with something like Vietnam memorabilia."
Road to Red Trunks The idea came to Thomsen during an audiobook recording session for "A Path Appears," a book written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and his wife, Sheryl WuDunn. The book profiles charities around the world and found a new way to measure their success.
After a conversation with actress Olivia Wilde, who was recording the book, a light bulb went off in Thomsen's head.
"I was like 'I want to record the stories of children from different countries around the world,'" Thomsen said. "The differences in each other is what makes life interesting."
The idea sat with him for a couple of years and morphed into the Red Trunk Project after his wife suggested reaching out to a friend to discuss the particulars.
"The idea of kids trading stories," Thomsen said, "became cultural artifacts, or maybe some video, that kids can touch and feel."
Once the project launched, two years later, Thomsen reached out to Kristof to tell him.
"Sheryl and I are thrilled to see what Kevin has done with the Red Trunk Project and to watch how it has grown," Kristof said. "It's just the kind of project that opens and nourishes young minds."
"He's been a great supporter, he even mentioned us in his newsletter," "Thomsen said of Kristof's support.
The first Red Trunk centers on Oaxaca, Mexico.
Thomsen approached Dr. Jill Vexler, a cultural anthropologist who has curated more than 40 exhibitions, through a mutual friend. Vexler, who spend years living in Mexico, reached out to another cultural anthropologist who was living in Mexico. With minimal conversation, they came up with identical lists for what artifacts must be in the trunks. Thomsen made three trips to Oaxaca to collect the artifacts, photos and video from the lists.
"It's a particularly cultural area," Vexler said of Oaxaca. " I wanted to show American kids how daily life solutions are solving the same problems just in different places.The artifacts and material culture of these solutions is very different and the tech to make the material culture is very different."
Michele Purpura, a third grade teacher at Brookside Elementary School in the Yorktown Central School District, had a Red Trunk visit her classroom this school year.
"For me, this was an unbelievable opportunity. The Red Trunk touched upon one of my favorite themes — acceptance," Purpura said. "I cannot explain how excited by students were during this project. They truly appreciated the artifacts, especially after viewing the videos."
The Red Trunk has visited school districts on Long Island, in Eastchester and Newburgh, in Orange County, and Thomsen said he is focusing on getting into more schools in Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess.
"We're aiming for one trunk per classroom for a two-week period," Thomsen said. "We're putting as many artifacts we can fit in the trunks with video and the 'Kids of Oaxaca' booklet. There are about 60 artifacts per trunk and we want to make hundreds of trunks to share with the world."
The next Red Trunks may focus on Kenya or China. Thomsen is in talks with the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, about a Native American trunk. He is also in talks with Rockland Pride about creating a rainbow trunk which would take a look at the history of the gay civil rights movement.
"It's about activism," Thomsen said. "We want kids to get active to help the environment whether on a micro or macro level. Recycling in their homes is a micro thing that can make a big difference."
'Mad Men' actor is helping the cause
On Thursday, the Red Trunk Project is holding a fundraiser called "Red Trunk Liftoff." There will be food, wine, a mystery raffle and an auction run by comedian Richard Kind.
What would be auctioned off to help a project such as this? How about enjoying 30 minutes of cocktail banter via Skype with "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm, who is also on the Red Trunk Project's board of directors, or the opportunity to take a two-hour boat ride via Nyack Boat Charters, complete with a picnic provided by Mimi's Plate?
"What Kevin and his team have done with Red Trunk is provide a unique cross-cultural experiential toolset to inspire a new generation of minds to understand different cultures first hand," Hamm said in a release. "To lead with acceptance and understanding and not fear is a valuable concept in today's increasingly polarized and fractured conversation. I am proud to support Red Trunk and hope to make its reach even wider and more significant."
The money raised at the Red Trunk Liftoff will be matched 3 to 1 to raise even more funds for the Red Trunk Project.
Go: Red Trunk Liftoff, OUTSIDE IN Gallery, 249 Ferdon Ave., Piermont. June 13, 6-9 p.m. $75 per person. To register for the event head to eventbrite.com/e/red-trunk-liftoff-tickets.

Texto completo: For Beacon author Sharon Watts, a line from a Buffalo Springfield song sums up the iconic Woodstock Music and Art Fair that is marking its 50th anniversay this August — and the impetus for her new book.
"There's something happening here . . . what it is ain't exactly clear."
"Springfield's tuneful lament sums up the late '60s and led half a million young people to an outdoor event called Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music," she writes.
"By the Time I Got to Woodstock" is an illustrated memoir by the former New York Times fashion trend illustrator who turns her focus back to 1969 and the festival she missed out on attending.
But a recent visit to the Museum at Bethel Woods, on the grounds of the sacred site that hosted the festival in Sullivan County, inspired Watts to explore not only who she was ("a suburban teenager obsessed with fashion and pop culture"), but also, what she missed.
The book captures her observations in pen-and-ink drawings with splashes of color, followed by "Footnotes for the Curious" and "A to Z — Arbitrary to Zow-y! (Far Out Facts, Mind-blowing Figures, and Spacey Oddities)."
"In 1969 I was an all-American suburban (i.e. white bread) teenager," she writes in the book, "but I was kind of quiet and shy. What saved me from total invisibility and dorkdom?? "I was an artist."
Watts's first book, "Miss You, Pat: Collected Memories of NY's Bravest of the Brave, Captain Patrick J. Brown" (2007), is a collection of stories to commemorate the 9/11 FDNY hero. It is part of the National September 11 Memorial Museum, where Capt. Brown's Ladder 3 fire truck is on permanent display.

Texto completo: Five anchorwomen at NY1, one of the country's most prominent local news channels, sued the network on Wednesday over age and gender discrimination, alleging a systematic effort by managers to force them off the air in favor of younger, less experienced hosts.
The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, portrays a newsroom at odds with the friendly image that has made NY1 a beloved institution among New Yorkers. And it publicized tensions that have long afflicted the TV news business, where older women's careers often fade as male counterparts thrive.
The plaintiffs range in age from 40 to 61 and include Roma Torre, one of the channel's longest-serving anchors. "We feel we are being railroaded out of the place," Ms. Torre said in an interview. "Men age on TV with a sense of gravitas, and we as women have an expiration date."
Ms. Torre, 61, and her co-plaintiffs -- Amanda Farinacci, Vivian Lee, Jeanine Ramirez and Kristen Shaughnessy -- said the leadership team installed by Charter Communications, the cable giant that acquired NY1 in 2016, reduced their airtime and anchoring slots, excluded them from promotional campaigns and consistently ignored their concerns.
"At some point, we were branded malcontents and told to stop complaining," said Ms. Torre, who joined the network at its inception in 1992.
A Charter spokeswoman, Maureen Huff, said on Wednesday that more than half of NY1's on-air talent is female, and that more than half is over 40.
"We take these allegations seriously, and as we complete our thorough review, we have not found any merit to them," Ms. Huff said in a statement. "NY1 is a respectful and fair workplace, and we're committed to providing a work environment in which all our employees are valued and empowered."
Charter, which is based in Stamford, Conn., has retained the law firm Proskauer Rose to defend against the suit.
New York City's first 24-hour local news station, NY1 built a low-fi look and familiar anchor lineup that was part of its town-square charm. Its blue-and-white logo has become a city signifier, making cameos in Manhattan-centric entertainment like "Law & Order: SVU" and "The Amazing Spider-Man 2."
When Charter purchased Time Warner Cable, NY1's parent company, it laid off about a dozen of the network's longtime anchors, men and women. The new owner also invested in modernizing the newscast, building a new set for the popular "Mornings on 1" and updating the graphics that had barely changed since David N. Dinkins was mayor.
The lawsuit filed on Wednesday claims that the revamp extended to sweeping out older women among the on-air talent.
For Vivian Lee, 44, who joined as an anchor in 2008, NY1 stood apart from other local channels in emphasizing substance over glitz.
"They weren't the big networks," she said in an interview. "They're stating the value they place on experience and community-driven news."
She added: "Until Charter came in, that feeling was there." The lawsuit alleges that after Ms. Lee's weekly show, "Spotlight," was canceled in January, managers demoted her and reduced her opportunities to fill in for weekday anchors.
"I'm faced with the feeling of what it's like to be edged out," Ms. Lee said. "It's really heartbreaking."
Ms. Torre is a familiar face to NY1 viewers, but she said her on-air presence had been steadily eroded since Charter took over. Once entrusted with three hours of solo anchoring time on weekdays, Ms. Torre says she now has one hour; some of her co-anchoring time was cut, too. And her theater reviews no longer appear on the weekly Broadway roundup, "On Stage," she added.
The lawsuit also includes Ms. Torre's frustration with NY1's favorable treatment of Pat Kiernan, its star morning anchor.
Ms. Torre's salary is "less than half that of Mr. Kiernan," the suit alleges. It also says that Ms. Torre was barred from using the makeup artists provided for Mr. Kiernan's show, and that when she asked to use his revamped studio, a manager told her to "stop complaining."
When Mr. Kiernan celebrated 20 years at the network, NY1 promoted the anniversary with an ad campaign, on-air segments and promotional food trucks. "Ms. Torre, by contrast, with a longer tenure and celebrating 25 years on air with her own daily live show, received no special promotion whatsoever," the suit says.
When Ms. Torre received a local Emmy Award in May, the official NY1 Twitter account posted a photograph of her accepting the prize -- with Mr. Kiernan featured in the foreground, snapping his own picture of Ms. Torre. The suit calls the tweet a "blatant" example of "NY1's favoritism toward Mr. Kiernan at Ms. Torre's expense." (When a user on Twitter asked why the network "couldn't let Roma have her moment," Mr. Kiernan replied: "I'm so sorry you interpreted this like that. I was just trying to get the shot.")
Ms. Torre and her fellow anchors are represented by Douglas Wigdor, a prominent Manhattan employment lawyer who represented the hotel maid in the sexual assault case against the former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn. He has sued major corporations, including Starbucks and Citigroup, and filed multiple discrimination suits against Fox News. (Mr. Wigdor's firm also represents clients in a racial discrimination suit against The New York Times.)
"Our five clients have clearly been told that their careers are over, as NY1 seems to believe that younger faces, when it comes to women, are a 'better look' for the bottom line," Mr. Wigdor said in a statement.
During a meeting at Mr. Wigdor's law office, the five anchors nodded in recognition as each described her experience as a woman in the competitive TV news business, including what they called an easier road for male colleagues.
"It fits the rhetoric of 'These whiny old ladies are complaining again,"' said Amanda Farinacci, 40, the network's Staten Island reporter. "But this is career-ending, these opportunities that we're not getting." Among other slights, the lawsuit alleges that Ms. Farinacci was excluded from moderating a town hall based on her reporting on Hurricane Sandy.
Like her colleagues, Ms. Farinacci invoked the case of Sue Simmons, the WNBC-TV anchor whose ouster in 2012 caused an uproar. Her co-anchor, Chuck Scarborough, remained at the network, where he recently celebrated his 45th year.
"It's always there as a woman," Ms. Farinacci said. "How much longer do I have? Where am I going? Look at Chuck, he's been there 45 years. And people just disappear, like Sue."
Age discrimination cases can sometimes be difficult to establish at trial, and lawyers who specialize in labor issues say some industries accept a certain amount of ageism as a matter of course.
"In Hollywood and the media, the perceived wisdom is that there's discrimination against older employees, particularly women, because employers want to put forward a younger face," said David Lopez, a former general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the dean of Rutgers Law School. "That's discrimination, in my book."
Mr. Lopez, who had not reviewed the NY1 lawsuit and spoke in general terms, said employers were often more comfortable expressing a bias against older workers, as opposed to bias based on gender or race.
"But it is against the law," he said, "even in the media industry."
Many of Mr. Wigdor's lawsuits are settled without an explicit finding of liability. In his office this week, the NY1 anchors said they hoped that going public with their claims might ease the pathway for women in their industry.
"We don't have animosity toward the younger people who are taking our jobs," Ms. Torre said. "But they're going to get older, too, one day. And this cycle has got to stop."

Texto completo: David Friedman, Israel's ambassador to Washington, said Israel "has the right to retain" some of the West Bank.
Palestinians fumed, Jewish settlers rejoiced, and the punditocracy predicted gloom and doom.
What was it exactly that Friedman said in a New York Times interview. And what happens next? War, war crimes trial, one state, two states?
What Netanyahu said
Before we get to what the ambassador said, we first have to deal with what prompted his comment. The Times asked Friedman to speak on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's pre-election promise.
Days before the April 9 vote, a TV reporter questioned Netanyahu about what was next on the territorial agenda now that the United States had recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
"Will we move ahead to the next stage?" the reporter asked.
"Yes. I will extend sovereignty," the prime minister responded, "but I don't distinguish between the settlement blocs and the isolated ones because each settlement is Israeli and I will not hand it over to Palestinian sovereignty.
"I will not divide Jerusalem, I will not evacuate any community and I will make sure we control the territory west of Jordan."
As The Jerusalem Post's Herb Keinon wrote, Netanyahu appeared to be carefully avoiding the term "annexation," which could be a war crime under international law. The problem with that semantic maneuver is that there is no distinction between "extending sovereignty" and "annexation."
What Friedman said
Friedman used neither the "annexation" or "extend sovereignty" terms. Instead he spoke of Israel "retaining" parts of the West Bank.
"Under certain circumstances, I think Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank," he said.
On its face, this is not unusual: The Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama administrations envisioned Israel retaining parts of the West Bank - but under a peace agreement, with mutual land swaps.
The difference is that The Times reporter, David Halbfinger, asked Friedman what the Trump administration would do if Israel annexed the West Bank unilaterally.
"We really don't have a view until we understand how much, on what terms, why does it make sense, why is it good for Israel, why is it good for the region, why does it not create more problems than it solves," Friedman said. "These are all things that we'd want to understand, and I don't want to prejudge."
One way to interpret that is that the U.S. could see fit to accept a move by Israel to treat some areas of the West Bank as fully part of Israel, short of formally annexing them. That represents a difference between the Trump administration and its predecessors, which closely watched and at times condemned any settlement expansion, saying such moves either made the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote or undermined the "road map" to a negotiated settlement.
Friedman, who himself raised funds for a West Bank settlement before becoming Trump's ambassador to Israel, appears to be saying that era is over. The Trump administration no longer picks at every announcement of a building expansion in eastern Jerusalem or the West Bank.
How the sides reacted
Israeli settlers celebrated Friedman's comments as a signal that the Trump administration was not interested in the two-state solution reviled by Israel's right-wing parties.
"It's time Israel decided its future and it's good that we have a friendly power like the U.S. working with us," Oded Revivi, who heads the Efrat Regional Council, told Arutz Sheva, the media outlet close to the settlement movement.
Palestinians said Friedman's remarks were another reason to skip the summit that President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has planned in Bahrain later this month to unveil the economic portion of his Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.
Friedman's New York Times interview made Palestinians, who already are boycotting the Trump administration after its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, even more furious.
"In what logic does Friedman think that Israel has the right to annex parts of the West Bank?" the Palestinian Authority Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Shoshana Bryen, the senior director of the conservative Jewish Policy Center, said Friedman was being appropriately cautious.
"Friedman takes the position that you can't comment on what you don't know about, which is the only proper position for a diplomat to take," she said in an interview. "Wait for something to happen, see what happens, hold it up against a variety of consequences and make a decision."
What happens next?
War crimes: The International Criminal Court is considering Palestinian Authority complaints that Israel has committed war crimes, among them actions related to its settlement activity. Palestinians say Israel violates international law because it is treating as its own occupied territory seized during a war. The Trump administration has made clear repeatedly that it will vigorously challenge any ICC attempt to charge Israel, including administering sanctions on ICC officials. Annexation could force the ICC's hand.
War: Trump's Jerusalem announcement helped trigger the sustained protests on the border between the Gaza Strip and Israel, which at times have turned violent and in April spurred an exchange of combat over several days.
While Kushner has alienated the Palestinians, he has cultivated close ties with Sunni Arab states, and they will attend the Bahrain conference.
Those states would not withstand an uprising among Palestinians, a factor that might explain Kushner's newfound caution regarding his peace plan. The Bahrain summit will focus exclusively on investment and economic opportunity for the Palestinians. Final-status issues will be discussed at an undetermined date, if ever.
Netanyahu, who cherishes the closeness he has cultivated with the Trump administration, may not want to rock the boat. He has been notably silent about his pre-election pledge since the vote.
One state, two state: Annexation would, the peace-watching community agreed, accelerate the death of the two-state solution, which could be a recipe for violence. Both Netanyahu and Trump have retreated from expressed support for a two-state outcome.
"That's not a peace plan," Martin Indyk, a top negotiator under Clinton and Obama, and a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Twitter. "It's a plan for continued conflict and the end of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.
The single actor still favoring a two-state solution, the Palestinian Authority, would be forced to give up on that dream, said Debra Shushan, the director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now, which favors a two-state outcome.
"Annexation would lead to increased popular pressure on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to reverse the PLO's support for two states and its recognition of Israel's right to exist," she said in an email. "Palestinians would intensify efforts for equal citizenship and rights for all between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, and their calls would gain support internationally, including in the U.S. Ambassador Friedman's green-lighting of annexation, which Prime Minister Netanyahu will find difficult to resist, will be the ruin of the Zionist dream of Israel as a democratic national home for the Jewish people."
Coincident to The Times interview with Friedman, The Wall Street Journal ran a story on growing support among Palestinians for a single state, one in which they would have a voice.
Jonathan Schanzer, a vice president at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, read that article and foresaw a recipe for violence.
"Let's be honest. The one state thing is not a solution," he tweeted. "And if it were somehow implemented, it would effectively mean the eradication of Israel as we know it."
At the very least, some Palestinian activists say, annexation would force Israel to face the contradictions of fully governing millions of people who are not citizens of their state. Annexation also would make advocacy for a single binational state easier, said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights.
"It's always been easier to make an argument here in the United States for equal rights than it was for separatism," Munayyer said in an interview. "The average American does not want to get into a nationalist dispute between two foreign peoples that they might not know the history of but everyone understands equality before the law, equal rights, racism and discrimination."

Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn’t turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven’t efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president’s most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three: 1. The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon’s re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s emails — a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon’s desire to conceal his campaign’s involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment.
In Trump-Russia, Mueller did not charge, although he clearly suggested, that Trump obstructed the investigation of an event — conspiracy/coordination — that did not happen. That meant the simplest, most plausible motive for obstruction — Trump, knowing he was guilty, tried to cover up his campaign’s conspiracy with Russia — was off the table. Given that, Mueller’s obstruction case veered all over the map. He conceded that Trump had many motives to act as he did — anger at being wrongly accused, concern over his ability to govern, a desire to defend the legitimacy of his election — and that none of them involved covering up conspiracy or coordination with Russia.
That’s a very different set of facts from Watergate. Consider the single most explosive episode of Watergate — the Saturday Night Massacre, in which Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox. Trump’s opponents say his desire to fire Mueller was Nixonesque. But try to imagine the Saturday Night Massacre with a Trumpian set of facts: What if Nixon told his White House counsel to tell the attorney general to fire Cox, but the counsel ignored the order? Nixon called again, and the counsel ignored him again. Nixon then let the matter drop, and Cox completed his investigation. No Saturday Night Massacre. That alone shows there is simply no comparison between Watergate and Trump-Russia.
2. The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts: CBS, NBC and ABC. There were two big newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers’ latest stories. There was no internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different — and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly.
"During the Watergate era ... there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Now, cable news, talk radio, thousands of websites and social media create a polluted firehose-blast of information mixed with disinformation.
"Back then, what was said on those three networks ... was largely believed," Sullivan added. "Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts — just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today’s media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government’s investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had 40-plus years ago.
3. Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media’s ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They’re better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.) So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today’s Trump-Russia affair into yesterday’s Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation’s attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 — a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It’s been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president’s opponents can’t make it 1974 again.

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE, DONALD TRUMP JUST DOESN'T GET IT; PLAIN TALK

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has made a joke of himself hundreds of times during his 30 months in office, but the biggest yet was his offer to Great Britain to forge a "phenomenal" trade deal with our oldest ally that would include opening up Britain's venerable National Health Service to private American companies.
You could almost hear Brits shouting in unison, "Are you kidding me?"
As columnist Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times, "It says something about the qualities of our current president that the best argument anyone has made in his defense is that he didn't know what he was talking about."
Last year in one of his many unsuccessful broadsides against Obamacare, Trump suggested that the English were marching in the streets against their health system. No, they weren't they were marching in favor of their socialized medicine system, urging the government to increase its funding.
It was just another of the 10,796 lies Trump has told in his less than 900 days in office. (That's right, more than 10 a day, according to the Washington Post's Fact Checker database.) Maybe Trump wasn't lying on this one, though. Maybe he just doesn't understand the American system. He's a man of privilege, after all, and never had to face life without health insurance coverage or had to go deeply in debt when inadequate insurance didn't cover the bills.
So perhaps he truly is unaware that America's system is what Krugman calls "the worst-performing health care system in the advanced world."
The Nobel Prize-winning economist isn't being hyperbolic. Britain, for instance, has a higher life expectancy than we do and a significantly lower infant mortality rate. So do most other countries with some form of a universal health system, from Canada to Germany, from Australia to Norway.
And remarkably, they are able to cover all their citizens from birth to death at roughly half the cost of the American system.
Demagogues like Trump, though, refuse to believe that could be true. No country does anything better than we do.
For too long, we've been buying into that belief. Whenever there are serious attempts to at least consider universal or single-payer initiatives, conservatives in particular trot out discredited bromides that Canadians have to wait months to see a doctor or the English can't stand their system, a la Donald Trump's falsehoods.
I remember a personal story told to me several years ago by longtime Madison lawyer Charles Hoornstra, who suffered a heart attack while vacationing in London. Not only was this non-British citizen given immediate and first-class care, there were no charges under the NHS system.
The reaction from the British to Trump's suggestion that a trade deal would put the NHS on the negotiating table was swift.
"The NHS may have challenges but I'm proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance," said Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt.
The organization that organized the march that Trump contended was to protest the British health system issued a statement that read, "We don't agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric. No thanks."
In early May, the BBC took a look at Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' push to revamp the American system into what he calls "Medicare for all."
The BBC account noted that "it's widely known that the U.S. has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, and health outcomes vary according to your means. President Obama tried to overhaul it. But even after his landmark Affordable Care Act, some 27 million Americans remain uninsured.
It's not a true universal system, the BBC noted, where the government owns and operates hospitals and employs the doctors, but a single-payer system that would increase Medicare benefits to include vision, dental and drug coverage not only to those over 65, but to everyone. In other words, the government is the sole insurance provider.
That would give millions of more Americans access to health care and stop the needless loss of life that results from our convoluted system.
Don't expect Donald Trump to understand that concept, either. CREDIT: By Dave Zweifel ; Dave Zweifel is editor emeritus of The Capital Times. dzweifel@madison.com, 608-252-6410 and on Twitter @DaveZweifel.

Several 2020 Democrats wish for a world without handguns

Texto completo: No one would own handguns in a perfect world, several Democratic presidential hopefuls believe.
"In an ideal world, people would not own handguns, and there are a number of countries around the world where people do not own handguns." said Julián Castro, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development told the New York Times. Castro acknowledged, however, that there is a constitutional right to bear arms and suggested reforms such as gun buybacks and universal background checks to address gun violence.
Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper offered a similar view of private handgun ownership.
"In an ideal world, you could philosophize it that no one wants handguns," Hickenlooper said. "Study after study shows that having a handgun in most cases makes you less safe, not more.”
The New York Times asked 18 Democratic presidential candidates whether anyone in an ideal world would own handguns. Some, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said that handgun ownership for the purpose of sport and target shooting are acceptable. Others said that a perfect world would not have violence or a need for guns, but indicated support for handgun ownership with proper limitations.
"Well, in an ideal world, no one would feel a need" to own a handgun, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said. "But I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the desire of people to have a means of self-defense, as long as there are common-sense measures."
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio holds a similar view.
"In an ideal world, anyone who owned a gun would know how to make sure they were safe and would use them responsibly," de Blasio said. "I believe in the Constitution, but I think the ideal world, gun ownership would be treated very, very differently."
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who has made combating gun violence a key issue of his campaign and proposed banning buying back 15 million assault weapons, said that he has "no problem with people owning handguns."
"Keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, keep your rifles," Swalwell said. "If you want to go hunt for with your family, shoot for sport, protect your house, that's within our Constitution and you're allowed to do that."
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has proposed a federal gun licensing system, did not directly answer whether anyone in an ideal world would own handguns, opting instead to talk about his frustration with lack of action in response to gun violence. "As president of the United States, I’m going to bring a fight to this problem like folks have never seen before," Booker said.
Former Vice President Joe Biden declined to participate in the New York Times project. He has previously suggested fingerprint locked firearms — "James Bond kind of stuff," Biden said, as a way to reduce gun violence.

Top Leader in Hong Kong Apologizes for Bill That Set Off Huge Protests

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Backpedaling under mounting pressure, Hong Kong's top leader publicly apologized on Tuesday for having proposed contentious legislation that would allow extraditions to mainland China.
"I offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong," the leader, Carrie Lam, said at a news conference at government headquarters.
"I've still got much to learn and do in better balancing diverse interests, in listening more to all walks of life and in taking our society forward," she added.
Mrs. Lam, who had already announced the extradition bill's indefinite suspension, did not concede to protesters' demands that it be withdrawn entirely. But she said that as long as there were public disputes over its contents, legislative work on it would not be resumed.
She also said that she would not resign as Hong Kong's chief executive, but acknowledged that "as for my governance in the future, it will be difficult."
Mrs. Lam was trying to strike a difficult balance on Tuesday, showing contrition to protesters without further giving in to their demands. She avoided antagonizing the Chinese leaders who appointed her by taking the blame for the legislation herself, not mentioning Beijing's support for it. She also tried to express concern for injured protesters without undercutting the Hong Kong police, whose use of force has added to public anger.
About 100 people gathered on Tuesday outside the offices of the central government and listened as Mrs. Lam's words boomed from a loudspeaker. Many booed as she spoke.
Samuel Chan, an electronics trader, said he did not believe Mrs. Lam was listening to the protesters.
"They are just responding to the issue according to a government mind-set," said Mr. Chan, 56. "Not the people's will."
Mrs. Lam faces broad public anger following three large-scale demonstrations over the past 10 days by protesters fearful that the extradition bill would encroach on their civil liberties. Even after her announcement on Saturday that the legislation was being suspended indefinitely, protesters turned out the next day in larger numbers than ever, with organizers providing an unverified estimate of close to two million of the territory's seven million residents.
The extradition bill would make it easier for Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, to send people suspected of crimes to jurisdictions with which it does not have extradition agreements. That would include mainland China, where the judicial system is notoriously opaque and under the tight control of the ruling Communist Party.
Opponents worry that if the bill were to become law, anyone in the city could potentially be sent to the mainland, including dissidents.
Sunday evening, the Hong Kong government responded to the march with a conciliatory written statement that ended with a rare apology from Mrs. Lam, who is known for almost never backing down in a fight.
Neither that apology nor the one on Tuesday was enough to satisfy Mrs. Lam's critics, many of whom have called for her to withdraw the bill outright and resign. As long as it is merely suspended, experts say, the approval process could be quickly restarted at any time in the Hong Kong legislature, which is controlled by pro-Beijing lawmakers.
The Civil Human Rights Front, one of the broader groups that helped organize the recent protests, said on Tuesday evening that it still wanted Mrs. Lam to resign.
A bigger priority for the group, however, is that the government drop all charges against those who were arrested during the protests.
The police have arrested at least 32 people since Wednesday, when a demonstration outside the Hong Kong legislature turned violent. A group of protesters attempting to storm the building threw umbrellas and other objects at the police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
The Hong Kong police commissioner, Lo Wai-chung, said on Monday that the government would pursue rioting charges against five people accused of being involved in the violence. Protesters had objected to his earlier characterization of the Wednesday protest as a riot.
On Tuesday, Mrs. Lam did not elaborate on Mr. Lo's remarks except to say that those who protested peacefully would not face legal action.
Her remarks represented the clearest apology for a major public initiative by any chief executive of Hong Kong since Britain returned sovereignty over the territory to China in 1997. Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's first chief executive, did not apologize in 2003 when he shelved Beijing-backed national security legislation that would have allowed warrantless police searches and the closing of newspapers deemed seditious.
The extradition fight has been compared to the one under Mr. Tung, who stayed in office for 21 more months but did not finish his term. Those who say Ms. Lam should resign are not willing to wait that long.
"Carrie has apologized but refuses to budge on withdrawing the bill and resigning," Anson Chan, a democracy advocate who was Hong Kong's second-highest official until her retirement in 2001, said on Tuesday. "It seems every concession has to be dragged out of her."
Some democracy activists are quietly nervous about the possibility of a resignation by Mrs. Lam, a lifelong civil servant, because her political heir apparent, Paul Chan, has a reputation for being even more strongly pro-Beijing.
Others are adamant that Mrs. Lam step down. They contend that the Hong Kong public should press for full and free elections rather than accept the current system, in which a pro-Beijing committee of fewer than 1,200 people selects the chief executive.
Protesters made similar demands for open elections five years ago, when they occupied major roadways for almost three months in what is known as the Umbrella Movement. While that movement did not achieve its short-term objectives, it had a major influence on this year's anti-extradition protests.
Emily Lau, a former chairwoman of the Democratic Party who is still an influential voice on democracy issues, said the politics of Mr. Chan, the financial secretary, should not deter critics from calling for Mrs. Lam's resignation.
"It would be a disaster to have him as chief executive," Ms. Lau said. "But we should not say, 'Because we don't want Paul Chan, maybe Carrie should stay."'

Texto completo: KHARTOUM, Sudan - Sudan's deposed dictator, Omar al-Bashir, was taken from a prison in the capital of Khartoum to face corruption charges Sunday, in his first public appearance since he was ousted from power in April.
Appearing in a white robe and turban, as he did for much of his 30 years in power, al-Bashir was led through the gates of Kober prison, a notorious facility where he once sent his own enemies.
His appearance quelled months of speculation among many Sudanese who suspected that, contrary to assertions by the country's military leaders, al-Bashir was being quietly detained in luxury or had even managed to flee the country.
Security officials escorted al-Bashir, 75, to a vehicle that took him to the chief prosecutor's office, where he was formally charged with corruption and money laundering. He did not speak to reporters waiting outside the jail.
In May, al-Bashir was charged separately with involvement in the killing of protesters during the street demonstrations that led to his ouster April 11. He did not appear in public then.
His predicament is a sharp contrast with the fortunes of his former enforcer, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, a militia leader groomed by al-Bashir who in recent weeks has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Sudan.
Hamdan faced global condemnation after June 3 when his paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces, stormed through a protest site in central Khartoum, killing at least 118 people in a frenzy of shooting, rape and pillage, according to witnesses and doctors' groups.
Hamdan's troops now control Khartoum, causing many to view him as the country's de facto leader, even if he is formally outranked by an older general.
But Hamdan, known as Hemeti, appeared to be laying the ground-work for a political campaign over the weekend when he addressed thousands of supporters at events in and around Khartoum, behaving in a political style that bore striking similarities to that of al-Bashir.
The Transitional Military Council, which formally rules Sudan, wants to dampen a wave of withering global criticism as the extent of the violence on June 3, including numerous rapes and scores of bodies flung into the Nile, increasingly comes to light.
Hamdan has been less apologetic. In an interview with The New York Times last week, he professed to disliking politics - "I hate politicians," he said - but added that his ascent to power was necessary for stability. He showed few signs of intending to vacate power. "The country needs the Rapid Support Forces more than the Rapid Support Forces need the country," he said.
That growing prominence could put Hamdan at odds with the regular army, stoking fears of further instability as Sudan maneuvers through the turbulent post-Bashir era.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has declared victory in his confrontation with Mexico. After he threatened to impose crippling tariffs on $350 billion worth of goods Mexico exports annually to the U.S., that country’s leaders agreed to measures aimed at impeding asylum-seekers from Central America that flow through Mexico headed for the American border.
The short-term headlines were certainly favorable to the president. But the long-term cost to Trump could be very damaging. The president’s strongest argument for a second term is a vibrant economy, and his actions are jeopardizing fiscal stability and his own re-election chances.
The clash with Mexico is part of a much larger pattern in which the president blusters and bullies his way around the world, threatening trading partners from China and Japan to France and Canada if they don’t knuckle under to his demands. And the backlash is already blossoming. The U.S. economy added only 75,000 new jobs last month, one of the lowest monthly totals since the last recession ended 10 years ago, and those results reflect a global economic slowdown that many economists blame at least in part on Trump’s trade tirades.
The World Bank cited "rising trade protectionism" as a prime cause of weakening economic growth in 2018.
Republican senators were so alarmed at Trump’s bellicose threats toward Mexico that they were preparing to block new tariffs before the president canceled them.
"We are going to have a lot of our members who are very concerned about where this is headed," said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, to The New York Times.
Since a healthy economy remains a prime GOP campaign issue, he added, "I don’t know why we would want to step on that." The Wall Street Journal warned in an editorial that "the effects of trade uncertainty are rippling out," and that the May jobs report was "a flashing yellow light that Mr. Trump needs to settle his trade wars and get back to promoting growth."
The economic slowdown is not the only thing signaling danger for the president. The brightest warning light, however, foreshadows the impact of Trump’s policies on the economy. Businesses detest chaos and confusion, but the president firmly believes that he thrives in precisely those conditions. And after his encounter with Mexico, he seems more emboldened than ever to raise tensions with trading partners by threatening new penalties.
"Protectionism shows no signs of abating; rather, it is intensifying," Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc., told the Times. Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, added on CNBC: "The weaponization of tariffs — the increase of threats on our economy, and on our farmers, our manufacturers, our consumers — is going to hurt our country."
Those farmers, manufacturers and consumers also vote. And Trump’s tariff tirades risk undermining economic growth, and alienating those voters, just as his re-election campaign is accelerating.

Texto completo: Plants and animals have some crazy lifestyles, particularly when it comes to pollination.
Pollination, as you may recall, is the transfer of pollen from one plant to another. This makes it possible for flowers to produce seeds, which, in turn, will produce more plants.
Insects need food, often in the form of plant sugars from nectar and protein from pollen. Put humans in the equation, and it’s a win-win-win situation. The plant gets to make more plants, the animal gets nutrition, and we get stuff we need — like soybeans, cotton, apples, tomatoes, and Tequila.
Pollination ranges from the straightforward to the intricate and complex. In the latter category is buzz pollination (or, to be fancy, "sonication"). Bumblebees seek nectar and pollen for food for their growing colonies in the summer.
Flowers in the tomato family have tons of nutritious pollen, but they don’t give it out for free. The flower won’t release its pollen unless it "hears" a certain vibration.
Bumblebees, it turns out, give off good vibes. In fact, just the right vibes.
Grasping onto the flower by the anthers, the bumblebee buzzes with a specific frequency. At this frequency, the flower explodes with pollen, giving the bumblebee its protein and coating it with pollen.
Thus doused, the bumblebee heads right to another flower, taking the pollen from Flower One to Flower Two, and on to many others.
Scientists have determined that the frequency of buzz pollination is equivalent to a C note on a tuning fork. (Or, the "Hey" in "Hey Jude," for those Paul McCartney fans out there.) And speaking of music, recent research has revealed an amazing new page in the pollination songbook.
Some flowers produce sweeter nectar when they hear pollinators approaching.
Yep, they "hear" or detect the vibrations of pollinators.
Michelle Z. Donahue reported in the January 2019 issue of National Geographic some exciting studies undertaken by Lilach Hadany of Tel Aviv University.
"Hadany’s team looked at evening primroses," wrote Donahue, "and found that within minutes of sensing vibrations from pollinators’ wings, the plants temporarily increased the concentration of sugar in their flowers’ nectar. In effect, the flowers themselves served as ears, picking up the specific frequencies of bees’ wings while tuning out irrelevant sounds like wind."
Sweet!
The Tel Aviv researchers also looked at flower shape and the ability to sense approaching pollinators. Plants with bowl-shaped flowers may be able to detect sound better than others.
"This makes them perfect for receiving and amplifying sound waves," explained Donahue, "much like a satellite dish."
This exciting research has launched a new field of study called phytoacoustics. It all goes to show that sometimes you do need to sing for your supper.
Another amazing plant-pollinator relationship has been recently discovered. Tilo Henning of the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum in Berlin, and Maximilian Weigend of the University of Bonn in Germany have hypothesized that a group of plants native to the Peruvian Andes can move their pollen-bearing structures according to past visits from pollinators.
Henning and Weigend studied the plant Nasa poissoniana and determined that it can remember the schedule of pollinator visits, and repeat their movements accordingly.
"These plants can gymnastically wave around their stamens — the organs they use for fertilization — to maximize the distribution of their pollen," according to Cara Giaimo in The New York Times.
"More surprisingly, (Henning and Weigend) suggest that individual plants can adjust the timing of these movements based on their previous experiences with pollinators. In other words, they remember the past and try to repeat it."
Crazy? You bet. You can read details of the research methods and conclusions in the April 2019 issue of Plant Signaling and Behavior.
A close-to-home example of unusual pollination is the skunk cabbage-carrion insect relationship.
Skunk cabbage, as the name implies, is a smelly plant that grows in wet woods. It’s one of the first plants to flower each year — often in February when the snow is still on the ground.
The flower is definitely not bouquet-worthy. It’s dark maroon, lacks petals, and is hidden by an overarching structure.
The color, as well as the stench of the flower, mimic dead, rotting things — hence attracting carrion beetles and flies.
The flower also produces its own heat, and can maintain a comfortable 60 to 70 degrees inside the floral covering. Perfect for those carcass-loving insects.
Other examples of strange pollination abound. With each new discovery, we find that the business of life is fascinating in its complexities.
What happens when one of the partners in the intricate dance of pollination disappears?
We are losing pollinators at an alarming rate, and plant extinction continues apace. Habitat loss and pesticide use are the big culprits.
Not to end on a buzz-kill, let me present some good news to counter the bad. Everyone can chip in to restore, preserve, and protect habitat for the myriad creatures around us.

Texto completo: KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Sudan's deposed dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, was taken from a prison in the capital Khartoum to face corruption charges on Sunday in his first public appearance since he was ousted from power in April.
Appearing in a white robe and turban, as he did for much of his 30 years in power, Mr. al-Bashir was led through the gates of Kober prison, a notorious facility where he once sent his own enemies.
His appearance quelled months of speculation among many Sudanese who suspected that, contrary to assertions by the country's military leaders, Mr. al-Bashir was being quietly detained in luxury or had even managed to flee the country.
Security officials escorted Mr. al-Bashir, 75, to a vehicle that took him to the chief prosecutor's office, where he was formally charged with corruption and money laundering. He did not speak to reporters waiting outside the jail.
Last month, Mr. al-Bashir was charged separately with involvement in the killing of protesters during the street demonstrations that led to his ouster on April 11. He did not appear in public then.
His predicament is a sharp contrast with the fortunes of his former enforcer, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, a militia leader groomed by Mr. al-Bashir who in recent weeks has emerged as one of the most powerful figures in Sudan.
General Hamdan faced global condemnation after June 3 when his paramilitary unit, the Rapid Support Forces, stormed through a protest site in central Khartoum, killing at least 118 people in a frenzy of shooting, rape and pillage, according to witnesses and doctors' groups. General Hamdan's troops now control Khartoum, causing many to view him as the country's de facto leader, even if he is formally outranked by an older general.
But General Hamdan, known as Hemeti, appeared to be laying the groundwork for a political campaign this weekend when he addressed thousands of supporters at events in and around Khartoum, behaving in a political style that bore striking similarities to that of Mr. al-Bashir.
On Saturday, General Hamdan drove in a long, heavily armed convoy to Garrhi, nearly 40 miles north of Khartoum, where he addressed supporters in a dusty clearing near the Nile.
He claimed that Western leaders were part of an unspecified plot to undermine him.
As he arrived under a blazing sun, he stood on top of a military vehicle, waving a stick at the cheering crowd in a manner that was reminiscent of Mr. al-Bashir. In his speech, he was sharply critical of the Sudanese Professionals' Association, which led the protests that forced Mr. al-Bashir's ouster.
"Askariya! Askariya!" his supporters yelled during the speech, using the Arabic term for "army rule."
Hundreds of soldiers surrounded General Hamdan as he spoke, positioned on buildings and trucks or sitting in pickups armed with heavy guns. After the rally, the vehicles sped off behind the general in a long trail of dust.
On Sunday, General Hamdan addressed a gathering of supporters in Khartoum.
The Transitional Military Council, which formally rules Sudan, wants to dampen a wave of withering global criticism as the extent of the violence on June 3, including numerous rapes and scores of bodies flung in the Nile, increasingly comes to light.
General Hamdan has been less apologetic. In an interview with The New York Times last week, he professed to disliking politics -- "I hate politicians," he said -- but added that his ascent to power was necessary for stability. He showed few signs of intending to vacate power.
"The country needs the Rapid Support Forces more than the Rapid Support Forces need the country," he said.
That growing prominence could put General Hamdan at odds with the regular army, stoking fears of further instability as Sudan maneuvers through the turbulent post-Bashir era.
Another test will be Mr. al-Bashir's forthcoming corruption trial.
Officials raided his Khartoum homes in the days after his ouster, confiscating bundles of cash in dollars, euros and Sudanese currency. That money -- millions of dollars -- is now a central part of the case prosecutors are building against him. An additional 41 officials from his government also face corruption charges.
Mr. al-Bashir is not, however, in any immediate danger of answering to the charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity that he faces at the International Criminal Court in The Hague over his role in the conflict in the western region of Darfur.
The international court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. al-Bashir a decade ago. But Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the Military Transitional Council, who also served in Darfur, said Mr. al-Bashir would never be extradited to face those charges in a foreign court.

Texto completo: Nueva York hizo historia ayer al convertirse en la primera ciudad del país en destinar fondos de su presupuesto a la atención del aborto.
La ciudad otorgará $250 mil dólares del presupuesto del año fiscal 2020 al Fondo de Acceso al Aborto de Nueva York (NYAAF), una organización que proporciona recursos y asistencia financiera a las personas que no pueden pagar un aborto y que viven o viajan a este estado, informó The New York Times.
Scott Stringer, contralor de NYC , destacó en un comunicado publicado el viernes en Twitter que aunque el aborto es legal en la ciudad, el acceso no siempre ha sido equitativo.
“Estoy orgulloso de que este año el presupuesto proporcionará una victoria progresiva e histórica para los neoyorquinos, y para nuestro país. Es el camino correcto para que la ciudad de Nueva York lidere a la nación “, escribió Stringer.
La medida se produce cuando varios estados trabajan para aprobar leyes que restringirían el acceso al aborto o lo harían ilegal en casi todos los casos.
También ayer, el tribunal federal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia dictaminó que el gobierno de Trump no puede impedir que las inmigrantes menores de edad y las detenidas por las autoridades tengan acceso a abortos.
Abortion is legal in New York, but access hasn’t been equitable.
Today, we take a step forward by providing direct funding for abortion care in the City budget.
I’m proud to have stood with @AMillerNIRH to make this a reality.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The work to redesign the $20 bill and affix an image of Harriet Tubman as its centerpiece was well underway before the Trump administration delayed the plans, according to a new report from The New York Times.
Efforts to redesign the bill were advanced enough for officials at the Secret Service and government engravers to review a metal engraving plate and a digital image of the Tubman mock-up as recently as May 2018, the report said.
The report cited current and former sources at the Treasury Department, which oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Times also included a preliminary image it obtained from a former Treasury official, completed in late 2016, of what a new $20 bill could look like, featuring Tubman "in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf," the report said.
A delay in the redesign of the $20 bill was motivated by concerns of a potential backlash from President Donald Trump, according to the report: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chose a timeline extending beyond Trump's presidency - even if he won a second term - to avoid the possibility of an explosive controversy, fearing that the president who has disparaged the redesign would cancel the plans altogether.
In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Mnuchin said the development of security and anti-counterfeiting measures first dictates the redesign process. "In the case of the $20 bill, that timetable is consistent with the previous Administration and has not been changed. As Secretary, my first responsibility is to ensure all security and anti-counterfeiting measures are properly taken in accordance with BEP's mandates. The suggestion that this process is being stalled is completely erroneous."
The director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Len Olijar said in a statement that "No Bureau or Department official has 'scrapped' anything; It is too early to develop an integrated concept or design until security features are finalized."

Texto completo: Act out (transitive verb): To represent in action; to translate into action; to express something directly in overt behavior without modification to comply with social norms (Merriam-Webster, 2019).
"Crazy as it sounds, I ran into Kristen [Woolf] at the grocery store by the chicken livers in the meat department, and we decided it was way past time to do something creative - maybe, I thought, called something like, 'two old ladies acting,' " Karla Eoff said.
"Kristen came back at me, saying, 'No, It should be about two old ladies acting out ,' " Eoff continued, laughing. "And here we are, owning who we are without apologies or explanations, audaciously leaning into it, and putting the plan in action."
And so, Woolf and Eoff, as the ever-lively and unapologetic "Two Old Ladies Acting Out," will be on hand this weekend at the SOMOS Salon and Bookstore to entertain their audiences with a selection of monologues and dialogues culled from centuries of writing -- literally from 400 B.C. to 2018 -- that finds unexpected grounding in our present day.
In each hour-long performance, the duo will offer seven vignettes in the simple yet intimate surroundings of the SOMOS Salon, located at 108 Civic Plaza Drive. Performances are scheduled for Friday and Saturday (June 14-15) at 7 p.m., and Sunday (June 16) at 4 p.m. Tickets are $5 at the door, which opens 30 minutes prior to each show, and seating is on a first-come basis.
"We didn't consider anything like age when we selected the pieces to perform," Eoff assured. It was simply that, over the course of their experiences in acting and producing, Woolf and Eoff had each amassed a backlog of materials they "loved or feared or were just curious about," as Woolf noted.
In her case, Woolf brings her fascination with ancient Greek culture to the performances. "Over my lifetime of reading about the Greek theater and the amazing plays that grew out of it, I began to wonder what it would be like to act in one," she said. "No theater in Western history is so heart-piercing, so beautifully poetic, written so perfectly for the stage. It's terse, shocking, elevating: in short, everything one wants in an evening of theater." A narrative from "The Trojan Women" by Euripides, and the confrontation between mother and daughter from his "Electra" are both included.
During her New York years, Eoff was fortunate enough to meet playwright Wallace Shawn while he was developing his one-man piece "The Fever," which Eoff and Woolf found enigmatic, challenging and interesting to include in their show. Indeed, a 2007 New York Times review of the monologue notes that it "exposes the contradictions and compromises of the urban liberal mind with a mercilessness that is sly and at times hilarious."
"Then there's Flo and Edna, the 'Polish Church Ladies in Housedresses,' cooking a funeral breakfast in the church basement for Mary Nowicki, and talking about making duck blood soup. It's lovely little scene from 'Lives of the Saints' by David Ives,' " Woolf said.
Eoff concurred. "Though Kristen had performed this before, I was unfamiliar with it but was immediately charmed. Flo and Edna have a sweet relationship, one where they finish each other's sentences, and Kristen and I just fell so easily into it. The vocabulary of the piece has entered into our own personal vocabularies."
Some years back Eoff had performed Jane Martin's "Handler" at Metta Theatre in El Prado, which Woolf remembered seeing and asked if they could revive it. On the surface it's a narrative about certain fundamentalist practices but, in digging deeper, the two discovered the story of a woman's journey from unquestioning faith, surrounded by her family, to loss, death and realization. "Hot stuff if you're an actor," noted Woolf.
At Eoff's recommendation, Colin Nissan's "Bad News" is included. Originally appearing as a 2018 "Shouts and Murmurs" column in the New Yorker magazine, Nissan's characters, Everybody and Everyone, follow world events on their cellphones. "Is there anything that's a truer slice of modern life?" Woolf wondered.
"And let's not even get started on 'Skin of Our Teeth' by Thornton Wilder," she continued. "Suffice it to say this play is even more relevant today than it was in 1942 [when it premiered]," noting its underlying universal themes of war, strife and climate issues.
Woolf and Eoff will move between characters in minimal costumes, using just an item or two to make the necessary differentiations. "The production flows quickly from vignette to vignette, and we want to keep the different aspects enjoyable and relevant to the audience. After all, in theater, the audience is as much a character in the performance as what we offer before them," Eoff observed.
Electra and Clytemnestra. Flo and Edna. Everyone and Everybody. With characters such as these, "We're like kids in a candy store." Woolf concluded. There's no doubt these two will leave you with your sweet tooth satisfied, as well.

Why Mindy Kaling is 'not going to talk to anyone' for now about her daughter's father

Texto completo: Mindy Kaling isn't planning on sharing the identity of her daughter Katherine 's father with the world anytime soon.
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, the Cambridge native revealed why she has stayed mum about the mystery man so far.
“My feeling is that until I speak to my daughter about that, I'm not going to talk to anyone else about it," Kaling told the magazine.
Despite writing two memoirs and a self-titled sitcom, Kaling, whose new film “Late Night" hits theaters on Friday, also said she doesn't necessarily have plans to use her life experiences as a new mom as comedic fodder.
“I could write stories about mothers, about my relationship with my daughter — but I don't know. It gets so 'Postcards From the Edge,"' Kaling said, referring to the late actress Carrie Fisher 's 1987 semi-autobiographical novel.
“I think people are often surprised that for someone who seems as open as I am on social media and who writes things that seem drawn from my life, I find that stuff really private."

Eminem tapes backed up months before Universal vault fire

Texto completo: The status of original, priceless master recordings by a host of top-name artists remained up in the air Tuesday following an explosive report revealing the true devastation of a 2008 Hollywood fire.
They include recordings by Detroit rapper Eminem. His tape reels were named among a slew of musical works in the New York Times' investigation into the fire on the Universal Studios lot, which destroyed a vault that may have contained up to 175,000 multitrack recordings, session masters and outtakes by "a genre-spanning who's who of 20th- and 21st-century popular music," as reporter Jody Rosen wrote.
Although the fire was widely reported in 2008, the report contends that Universal Music, the world's biggest record company, hid the staggering scope of the loss from the public and even affected artists. The facility apparently included master tapes of music by Chuck Berry, Louis Armstrong, Nirvana, Tom Petty, Elton John, Ray Charles, George Jones and many others, according to the Times story.
Universal has storage facilities across the country, and it's difficult to get a comprehensive accounting of which tapes were housed where at the time of the fire. That seems to be the case for Eminem: His representatives were unable to say Tuesday which of the rapper's master tapes may have been stored in the vault destroyed by fire.
However, "I'm fairly confident that most, if not all, of the masters are backed up," Eminem spokesman Dennis Dennehy told the Free Press.
Indeed, those tapes seem to have been painstakingly duplicated onto digital media just in the nick of time – months before the June 2008 disaster.
Joel Martin, operator of 54 Sound studio in Ferndale and manager of Eminem's former production team, the Bass Brothers, said his team digitized all of the tape reels at hand in early 2008. That included Eminem music recorded at 54 Sound – such as "The Marshall Mathers LP," "The Eminem Show" and hits such as "Lose Yourself" – along with tapes created in Los Angeles with producers such as Dr. Dre.
Martin said he was spurred to undertake the "thorough process" of backing up the tapes when Universal, Eminem's label, requested that all of the rapper's recording reels be sent to L.A.
"They was some type of effort under way to get all of the master tapes into one place," Martin said. However, he noted, "I'm not sure where (Universal) kept them."
The backups, while vital, still don't equate to the original session reels – the first-generation magnetic tape bearing the cleanest, most precise document of the music. And digital media has its own long-term issues with degradation and compatibility.
Still, Martin's backup effort included Eminem's raw 24-track tapes, containing all of the assorted vocals, instruments, beats and other sounds captured in isolation. That's crucial for future remixing projects and other uses of the music that made Eminem the best-selling recording artist in the first decade of the 2000s.
Eminem isn't the only iconic Detroit music figure whose original recordings may have been destroyed in the Universal fire: The Times reports the casualties apparently included the master tape of Highland Park native Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock," the towering 1955 single that topped the Billboard chart to launch the rock 'n' roll era.
And the earliest recordings by teenage Aretha Franklin – gospel music captured at Detroit's New Bethel Baptist Church – were also "very likely lost" in the fire, the Times reports.
An earlier calamity had already destroyed the masters and multitracks for much of the Queen of Soul's best-known work: Her session reels for Atlantic Records in the '60s, a body of work including songs such as "Respect" and "Chain of Fools," were wiped out by fire at a New Jersey warehouse in 1978.
That disaster helps illustrate the potential impact of the 2008 Universal fire: Every post-1978 reissue of vintage Aretha Franklin music has been drawn from sources well down the line from the pure multitrack tapes. In 2017, for instance, the producers of an album blending classic Franklin recordings with the London Philharmonic Orchestra were relegated to using the singer's stereo masters, limiting their flexibility with the project.

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

Texto completo: Bushwick Bill terrified a vice president's wife into regulating song lyrics, released album art of himself bleeding on a gurney with a gunshot wound to the eye, and helped put Houston into the global hip-hop archipelago.
The 52-year-old rapper, born Richard Stephen Shaw, died Sunday in Colorado, according to representatives for Bill who spoke to the Associated Press. He had been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
The MC was one of hip-hop's most colorful and charismatic figures, whose macabre lyricism in the group Geto Boys -- imbued with horror-movie violence drawn from life in Houston's rough Fifth Ward -- laid the groundwork for transgressive rap scenes to come.

The rapper was born in Kingston, Jamaica, with a form of dwarfism (he stood roughly 3 feet, 8 inches). After spending his early life in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, his family moved to Houston in the '80s. He initially joined Geto Boys as dancer billed as Little Billy but soon became its most recognizable MC from the group's 1988 debut "Making Trouble" onward.
The group -- revamped with MCs Willie D and Scarface in its popular incarnation -- gained notice on the Houston imprint Rap-A-Lot, which helped pioneer a Southern-rap style of brash, noisy and tape-warped productions. Geto Boys immediately attracted controversy and intrigue for their surreally violent lyrics, which both reflected and amplified their lived experiences surrounded by drugs, guns and poverty in Houston's humid haze.
"People want to hear what's going on around them in everyday life -- war, blood, violence," Bill told Spin in 1990. "It's okay for the president to start a war in Iraq, but it's not okay for me to talk about what I see around me in the ghetto."
But the group also had literary and cinematic streaks. Bill always defended songs like "Mind of a Lunatic," with its explicit depictions of rape and violence, as character studies. "If people believe that the Geto Boys really do stuff like on 'Mind of a Lunatic,' they must also believe there's a real Freddie Krueger and a real Michael Myers," he told Spin.
In one of his most famous lyrics, Bill pointed out that hypocrisy.
"You don't want your kids to hear songs of this nature," he rapped on 1989's "Talkin' Loud Ain't Sayin' Nothin'." "But you take 'em to the movies to watch Schwarzenegger."
Geto Boys were an independent commercial hit, selling hundreds of thousands of copies of their albums across the South, and soon signed with mega-producer Rick Rubin. Rubin reworked their second album, "Grip It! On That Other Level," into what would have been the group's Geffen Records-distributed debut. But in an era when N.W.A became Christian-right villains and 2 Live Crew challenged obscenity charges in court, the major-label debut was thwarted after the label got nervous, declining to distribute it because of its NC-17 content.
"Love, sex, war and politics -- that's what the album is about,'' Bill told the New York Times at the time. "We were just expressing stuff that happens in the ghetto, just being like reporters."
The group's 1991 album, "We Can't Be Stopped," is perhaps its most infamous. The cover art featured Bill just after an altercation with a girlfriend where, high on PCP, he was shot in the eye (his exact version of events varied over the years). Blood-spattered on a stretcher, with Willie D and Scarface beside him, the album was an apotheosis for Geto Boys' aesthetic -- morbid and provocative. Bill would later rap about the incident on "Little Big Man," his 1992 solo album.
"We Can't Be Stopped" also contained Geto Boys' most notorious track, "Mind Playing Tricks on Me," in which Geto Boys' hyper-violent lyricism turned to hallucinatory, psychological noir: "The more I swung, the more blood flew / Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too / Then I felt just like a fiend / It wasn't even close to Halloween / It was dark ... on the streets / My hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete."
The group had a feud with Tipper Gore, wife of then-Vice President Al Gore and founder of the Parents Music Resource Center, an activist group that pressured labels into censoring lyrics the group found objectionable (with hip-hop artists like Ice T's Body Count and heavy metal bands like Judas Priest most often targeted). But the PMRC's efforts likely only increased the performers' profiles.
Bushwick Bill would cameo on Dr. Dre's landmark 1992 album, "The Chronic," and appeared in the video for the popular diss track "Dre Day." His taste for provocation never faded: In the '90s, he changed his public name to Dr. Wolfgang Von Bushwickin the Barbarian Mother-Funk Stay High Dollar Billstir.
But Geto Boys' dank, hooky antagonism stayed in the spotlight. Later that decade, Geto Boys would enjoy a fairly mainstream film moment when their song "Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta" was used in Mike Judge's 1999 cult hit "Office Space," where it soundtracked the main characters' rebellion from white-collar malaise.
Geto Boys were scheduled to reunite this year for a short tour called "The Beginning of a Long Goodbye: The Final Farewell," which acknowledged Bill's illness. But the tour was canceled as Bill's prognosis worsened.
Bill's contributions to Geto Boys helped establish the Houston rap culture that would inform native Texan artists like UGK and, famously, Beyonce and Solange Knowles (the latter brought Geto Boys' Scarface on as a guest on her new album, "When I Get Home"). A generation of antagonistic, distortion-laden SoundCloud rap would later draw from Geto Boys' legacy and revamp it for an era of internet-driven nihilism and introspection.
"'I'm going to be heard anyway," Bill told the New York Times in 1990. "They can't hold us back because we're going to be doing shows and people will be hearing the songs anyway. The truth can't be stopped.''

What MOCA might have been; Arata Isozaki's Kyoto Concert Hall, built just after the L.A. project, has traits that weren't possible here.

Texto completo: With not a little pomp and some multilingual speechifying, architect Arata Isozaki was awarded the 2019 Pritzker Prize at the Chateau de Versailles outside of Paris late last month.
As part of the ceremony, Supreme Court Justice and Pritzker juror Stephen Breyer, speaking French, delivered a missive in honor of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, which recently sustained extensive damage in a fire. Afterward, Tom Pritzker, president of the Hyatt Foundation, the organization that awards the Pritzker, presented Isozaki with the medal and citation.
"He is both an adapter and an originator," Pritzker said. "He is an architect whose appetite for architecture is never satisfied."

While the Okinawa-based Isozaki was jetting off to France to receive the award, I was on a train to Kyoto as part of one of The Times' travel expeditions, this one devoted to examining the architecture of Japan. On the itinerary: a visit to Isozaki's Kyoto Concert Hall in a quiet district in Japan's former capital.
It was instructive.
Isozaki has only a handful of buildings in the United States, among them the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, completed in 1986, and his critically acclaimed Team Disney Orlando building, administration offices built in 1990 for the Walt Disney World Resort.
Although his MOCA building is important -- it's the architect's first high-profile international commission -- it is also a difficult building by which to judge Isozaki's work, since it represents a heap of design compromises.
For one, there is the site, which is extraordinarily complicated: adjacent to steep Bunker Hill and set over a parking structure from which the museum was forced to take its column grid. Moreover, the commercial developers who controlled California Plaza, the superblock where the museum is located, didn't want MOCA's structural profile interfering with the towers that inhabited the rest of the block. Isozaki was forced to put most of the museum below street level.
In a recent essay about the development of Grand Avenue, real estate developer and former MOCA board Chairman Eli Broad says the whole thing "was an unfortunate compromise for Los Angeles, for a talented architect ... and for me."
"As chairman of the board, I had led negotiations between the museum board, the developer and the city -- and I'm not sure I did enough to get the landmark we needed."
Isozaki's Kyoto Concert Hall in many ways is a testament to the promise Los Angeles squandered.
Completed in 1995, the concert hall sits on a flat piece of terrain alongside a library and the Kyoto Botanical Gardens in a primarily residential district on the city's north side.
Like MOCA, the building is a play on shapes. A cylindrical tower houses the foyer and a circular ramp that leads to the concert hall; a rectangular prism contains the concert hall; and the street-facing facade features an undulating wave pattern clad in translucent glass. The foyer, meanwhile, features an ebullient array of patterns including cubes, triangles, cylinders and circles.
Most compellingly, Isozaki has tucked the entrance at the rear of the property, away from the narrow street where the concert hall is located.
This requires the visitor to walk along the northern flank of the building to reach the ticket window and the main doors -- a procession that runs beside a glistening reflecting pool.
Isozaki is an architect interested in making the most of transitional spaces (such as the descending staircase that serves as the principal entryway to MOCA). By the time you arrive at the main door of his Kyoto Concert Hall, you are in a different space, both mentally and physically.
There are also his thoughtful transitions in materials. The hard surfaces of the building -- such as the glass and steel of the facade and the marble floors of the foyer -- give way to the softer Pietra Serena sandstone of the access ramp. This ultimately reveals the performance hall, a warm, oak-lined room, in a shoebox configuration, that seats 1,833.
Behind the stage looms a pipe organ that was custom-designed to include stops for Japanese instrumentation -- and whose asymmetrical layout nods to the Japanese design ethos that prizes balance over symmetry. The hall's acoustics were designed by Nagata Acoustics, the same celebrated firm that worked on Walt Disney Concert Hall.
Perhaps the building's greatest success is the way in which Isozaki nods to historic Japanese architecture while remaining resolutely contemporary -- and making more than an occasional nod to the traditions of the West. (A classical music hall of this nature is a Western conceit.)
This is no small thing. Unlike Tokyo, Kyoto survived World War II relatively unscathed. And it is a city rich with architectural traditions, studded with dozens of ancient temples and the globally important Katsura Imperial Villa, the 17th century royal compound that got early European Modernists such as Walter Gropius all hot and bothered for its clean lines and graceful yet functional proportions.
The influence of these ancient traditions on Isozaki is everywhere: the sooty color of the cylindrical tower, which channels the singed panels of Kyoto's old wooden townhouses; the curved footbridge that leads over the reflecting pond, evocative of Japanese gardens; the artisanship of the performance hall, laden with wooden screens that hearken to traditional Japanese designs; the demure color palette of the performance area, with its velvety blue-gray seats, channeling the tones of historic scroll paintings.
The building acknowledges history, but it's never derivative. In its layout, its materials and its amenities, the Kyoto Concert Hall is a very contemporary building.
In 1995, when it opened, Paul Goldberger, then a staff critic at the New York Times, described it as a structure that found "common ground between past and present."
The structure also shows what an architect can do when he isn't hampered by piles of restrictions. For Los Angeles, an important lesson in what might have been.

Pro-abortion New York Times ad reveals the hypocrisy of liberal elites

Texto completo: Over 180 CEOs signed a full-page pro-abortion ad in Monday’s New York Times with the strange and undescriptive title, “Don’t Ban Equality.” Left-wing big businesses, including Ben & Jerry’s, H&M, and Tinder (of course) signed the ad, stating, “[i]t’s time for companies to stand up for reproductive healthcare.”
These companies claim “comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion” is necessary to “build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines.”
There is some great irony here, as abortion disproportionately kills children of color. Sixty-four percent of women who obtain abortions in the U.S. are either African American or Hispanic, according to a 2017 report from Kaiser Health News. Abortion is the reason the black share of the U.S. population is shrinking, not growing. So abortion actually makes it harder for businesses to hire a diverse workforce, not easier.
These companies also claim that anti-abortion legislation prevents them from “recruit[ing] top talent from across the states.” But how is this so? If anti-abortion laws are so terrible and if pro-abortion laws are so wonderful, we would see people fleeing red states and moving to the blue states where many of these companies, such as Ben & Jerry’s, Postmates and Square Inc., are headquartered.
What we are seeing, however, is people leaving blue states such as California and New York for states with lower taxes and greater economic mobility. If these companies were truly concerned about their ability to recruit top talent, they’d focus on reforming tax policy, not abortion policy.
The businesses also claim to “stand against policies that hinder people’s health, independence and ability to fully succeed in the workplace.” But do these liberals also support a worker’s “independence” when he declines to join a union he doesn’t like? What about small business owners' "independence" when they choose not to cater events that celebrate what they believe is morally wrong? I kinda doubt it.
This continued animosity towards anti-abortion legislation is ridiculous and, in this instance, misdirected. If these companies are wondering why they don’t have more diverse work environments with greater worker independence, they should look in the mirror.

Texto completo: HBO host Bill Maher told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday that while he aligns with Democrats because Donald Trump is president, he believes the political correctness within the party goes too far.
"They have some things to answer for," Maher began. "They don’t help themselves a lot and a lot of this far-left political correctness is a cancer on progressivism."
"When you talk to Trump supporters, they’re not blind to his myriad flaws, but they always say is, 'He’s not politically correct.' I don’t think you can overestimate how much people have been choking on political correctness and hate it," Maher continued.
"There were two studies about this recently. It was in the New York Times, front page story a few months ago. It was also in the Atlantic about a year ago. The vast majority of liberals in this country hate it. They think political correctness has gone way too far. No one likes to be living on eggshells," he said.

Maher has been a stanch critic of political correctness for years, even hosting a show called "Politically Incorrect" until 2002. His outspokenness on the issue, along with his views on Islam, have often ruffled feathers.

Texto completo: The Nepalese government seeks help in identifying four climbers whose bodies were brought down from Mount Everest during a particularly deadly climbing season atop the world's tallest peak.
According to Agence France-Presse, the remains were worn to near skeletons because of the brutal conditions and brought down as part of a larger cleanup effort on the mountain. Officials weren't sure how long the remains had been on Everest, AFP reported.
"We're waiting for families to come and claim the bodies," Dandu Raj Ghimire, director general of the Department of Tourism, told Reuters on Thursday.
About 300 people have died on Everest over the years, including at least 11 this climbing season, which has been marked by crowded slopes, inexperienced climbers and bad weather.
Mira Acharya, a director at Nepal's tourism department, told The New York Times that if families do not come forward to claim the remains, the bodies will be cremated.
What caused Everest's deadly season?: Overcrowding, inexperience and a long line to the top
The government plans to work with embassies in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, to get in touch with the families of foreign climbers who died on Everest, the Times reported.
When climbers die on Everest, their bodies are rarely brought down, given the deadly conditions on the mountain. Especially in the "death zone," the area between the last camp and summit, the air is so thin atop the mountain that other climbers and Sherpas cannot exert extra energy carrying a dead climber's body without risking their own life.
As a result, bodies and mounds of trash have piled up for years on the mountain's more-than-29,000-foot peak.
More than 24,000 pounds of trash have been removed this year as officials push to clean up the mountain, The Associated Press reported.

The cleanup effort came as climbers crowded the mountain, holding a record-breaking 381 permits issued by the Nepalese government. Alan Arnette, a prominent Everest blogger who tracks the climbing season, said there were nearly 900 summits in 2019.
Those record numbers led some mountaineers to blame the 11 deaths this year on overcrowding. Photos from the mountain showed climbers waiting in a long line to summit.
Others faulted guide companies willing to bring up inexperienced climbers who can pay. Nepal's government said poor weather limited the number of days that a summit attempt was possible, further exacerbating the issues on the mountain.

College Board unsuited to solve social problem; OP-ED

Texto completo: The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the SAT, should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to The New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because their more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social-science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., "legacies" - the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective - meaning standardized - test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring - guessing, actually - the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character.
Physicists speak of the "escape velocity" of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children, advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious "Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course in Getting His Kid into College," says, America's least diverse classes are SAT prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score - schools will know it, applicants will not - will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of - and the inevitable shrinking of - schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies, and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating "diversity" obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for - it is alleged - the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans. They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a "problem" eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

A Big Tech Breakup? Don't Count On It

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.
Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Big tech is about to face a reckoning. Probably.
The federal government is reportedly considering antitrust inquiries into Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. The Justice Department will handle Apple and Google; the Federal Trade Commission takes Facebook and Amazon. The House Judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust also plans to investigate possible anticompetitive behavior and decide whether current antitrust laws need to be updated.
This is what vocal critics, as varied as a Facebook co-founder and Senator Elizabeth Warren, have been waiting for: the chance to hold these companies to account and use antitrust law to break them up.
But how far will the new wave of investigations go?
■ Don't expect this to be quick. When the government went after Microsoft in the 1990s (the last major United States tech antitrust case) it took 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation to a court-approved settlement. The work now may be more substantial: Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University, said that the agencies taking on these four companies were "clearly ambitious."
■ Forget wholesale change. All the companies have multiple fronts on which antitrust battles could be waged: Google could be pursued for dominance in ad tech, search, Android or something else. "You can't do everything," Mr. First said. "They will have to find a focus, quickly." So the agencies will chase specific problems.
■ Legal action isn't guaranteed. The agencies usually take to court only the cases they're confident they can win, so many investigations fizzle well before that point. And big tech has huge legal and lobbying teams, so the bar for a government slam dunk is high.
■ Punishments may disappoint. Remedies to antitrust violations must be tailored to the harm. If WhatsApp and Instagram were the root of anticompetitive behavior by Facebook, then, sure, force a spinoff. But the remedy is dictated by the (very specific) violation, not vice versa, and it may be that limits on business practices are more relevant.
All of which is to say: The antitrust showdown will be long, difficult, uncertain and, for some, potentially disappointing.
That doesn't make it a bad idea. Even abandoned investigations can yield some change: Google made voluntary business changes after the F.T.C. dropped a 2011 antitrust investigation into it. And the point isn't just fixing the current problem: It's also about deterring future bad conduct.
ITunes lives on
In 2003, Apple made a masterstroke: Its music software, iTunes, was released for Windows as well as MacOS. ITunes became a Trojan horse, putting Apple products in the hands of non-Apple users and democratizing the iPod, which exploded in popularity.
Fast-forward to this past week, when Apple killed iTunes. Yes, the software was bloated and slow. But it was also a hangover of an older Apple built on the success of the iPod, then the iPhone.
Now, Apple's iPhone sales have plateaued, and the company is having to find new ways to grow, said Roberta Cozza, a senior research director at Gartner. Its strategy for that was on display in announcements at its developer conference.
ITunes is being split into Music, Podcast and TV apps, the latest part of Apple's push to compete on services with the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Its Watch will get a dedicated App Store, so people won't need an iPhone to use one. And a new universal authentication tool promises more secure logins, not limited to Apple platforms.
Together, those announcements show Apple experimenting again with how to put its products in the hands of more people. ITunes is dead; long live iTunes.
YouTube's new rules
Rules can be useful. If we all follow them, they help us coexist in harmony. But sometimes new things happen and rules don't change. Then things go wrong, people get upset (or worse), and it's time to invent new rules. That's also good!
YouTube announced on Wednesday new rules that mean "videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion" will be banned. So will those denying violent events, like the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut. A three-strike rule will apply to users sporadically uploading such content, and those who repeatedly come close to violation won't be able to profit from YouTube ads.
Sounds positive. Only, YouTube also showed this past week that it struggles to live by its rules. It came to light that Steven Crowder, a popular conservative commentator on YouTube, had repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox, using racial and sexual slurs. Initially YouTube said Mr. Crowder's comments did not break its rules. Later, after an outcry, it appeared to backtrack and said he couldn't earn ad revenue on his channel unless he changed some practices.
So, rules. Great if you enforce them effectively. But ... kind of pointless if you can't?
What's in an I.C.O.?
Imagine you run a company and need money. One idea: Promise a thing to people, take some money and send the thing later. That's O.K. It's crowdfunding. What if, instead of offering a thing, you offer a cryptographic token to exchange for a thing in the future? That may be less O.K.
On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Kik Interactive, a Canadian social media company, over this. In 2017, Kik sold $ 100 million worth of digital "coins" called Kin that would be used to buy and sell digital services. This is an initial coin offering, a practice with a bad rap thanks to some less than scrupulous companies. Kik isn't accused of fraud; it's accused of not properly registering the offering with the S.E.C.
This rests on what, exactly, Kik was offering. The S.E.C. says Kin counted as a security, like stocks, because it couldn't be used to buy anything when it was launched. The S.E.C. also claims Kik said Kin investors could "make a ton of money" from appreciation, as with securities. Kik says that Kin is now a proper medium of exchange and that investors didn't expect to profit, so it's not a security and didn't need to be registered.
Well, it either is or isn't, and now a court will decide. The distinction will be important: It will shape the S.E.C.'s ability to regulate the industry, and help the crypto world understand what it can, and can't, do.

Texto completo: It's hard to work up much sympathy for the hollowed-out husk of a human being that is Mitch McConnell, or Lindsey Graham for that matter. This country is a harder, colder, more mean-spirited place because these senators would rather bootlick a bully than stand for the principles they once espoused.
Surely, they know the price of their vassalage. To serve Donald Trump is to lose all self-respect. You lie for him. You cover for him. You hate for him. 
But Americans should care about a more lasting and damaging corrosion - the destabilizing of venerable institutions. It's one thing to corrupt a politician, the natural osmosis of the species. It's quite another to debase the foundations of a great democracy.
It started on Day 2, when the hapless liar, newly subsidized by taxpayers, tried to conscript the National Park Service into the fantasy that his crowd was the largest ever.
After the inauguration debacle, Trump moved on to bigger targets - the judiciary, the military, the press, and the professional class of bureaucrats who have made the United States a model for competence and incorruptibility in the Civil Service.
With William Barr, Trump now has an attorney general who doesn't care how much lasting damage he does to truth, justice and the American way. His mandate as the nation's top prosecutor is to carry out Trump's private vendettas.
This week, the House will vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt for defying the constitutional role of oversight by the legislative branch. Get used to it. Barr is marshaling the enormous legal muscle of the people's Justice Department as a political hit squad. He'll use the law, which he ignores when it suits him, to try to imprison public servants who launched an early investigation of Russian attempts to subvert a U.S. election.
Barr's job is to muddy the origins of the Russian investigation enough to frame career public servants as traitors.
Normally, the courts would be bulwarks against the barbarians. And indeed, many judges have stood up to some of Trump's most outlandish and illegal behavior. But the Trump effect, turning everything he touches to a cheap commodity, is to denigrate the legal arbitrators as "Obama judges" or "Mexican" judges. You're with him or against him.
You would think that matters of the soul would be harder for the soulless occupant of the White House to tarnish. After a round of golf last Sunday, a disheveled-looking Trump abruptly showed up at a church in Virginia. The White House said Trump wanted parishioners to pray for victims of a recent mass shooting. Instead, they were asked to pray for Trump. The pastor later said he had been blindsided.
The same cannot be said for the man who oversees the Census Bureau, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He's trying to use a mandate of the Constitution, the decennial census, to shore up power in the Electoral College and Congress for the aging white men of Trump's base.
Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on Ross' effort to insert, into the census form that goes out to every household, a citizenship question, something that hasn't been asked since 1950. It could mean that about 6.5 million people would go uncounted - citizens and noncitizens.
This is a blatant abuse of power and of an otherwise benign government agency, affecting not just the number of representatives or electoral votes each state gets, but also the fate of numerous cities dependent on federal billions in mostly blue America.
We've had a census every decade since 1790, after the colonies threw off a king and created a governing document establishing an independent judiciary, a legislative branch that writes the rules of the land, and asserting that no man is above the law. To the present occupant of the White House, it's only a piece of paper.

You're productive, right? Well, maybe not so much

Texto completo: Whether you are running a startup, building a relationship, or rebuilding a community, there's an easy part and a hard part.
One requires less work in the moment while the other unlocks the potential of your efforts and concurrently is your playground for personal growth.
Those comfortable things that require little thinking, risk, or effort exist to test you. They can easily chew up your time and trick you into thinking you're being productive.
Updating your Facebook status, gossiping with colleagues, or going to yet another lunch are not the activities that will enable your achievement.
Doing the work that you've already mastered, triple-checking a bureaucratic form, or spending a full hour in a meeting that should take 11 minutes all strip away your ability to soar.
It's the things you resist — those that are challenging and at times a bit scary — that are the real work.
Let's say you run a software company. Planning the holiday party and decorating the lobby are not the activities that will drive sales. Making that 94th cold call, listening deeply to customers in order to better serve their needs, or taking extra time to build a creative culture ... those are far more difficult, yet will add a lot more value than simply going through the motions.
So many people fall into the 'being productive' trap. Even though they squander their time on things that can barely be justified as adding value, the end of the day comes with the feeling as though a contribution has been made. In today's hyper-competitive environment, you're job isn't just to stay busy. It is to prioritize your efforts and do the things that will add the most value — even when they're more difficult.
Most organizations are filled with people spending 90% of their time doing the easy part; the tasks that require little insight and have no ambiguity. By definition, the things that are clear-cut have the least room for innovation. The hard part is where competitive advantage is won. Where careers are made. Where civilizations advance.
Take a quick inventory of this week's upcoming calendar. Are your days packed with activities that you could do just fine with a hangover, or are you investing your time in value creation? Does the art of creative problem solving or unleashing your imagination require work, risk, and energy? For sure. Will it help you and your organization seize significant growth? Absolutely. What's the hard part in your organization? What's the hard part in your life? Those are beacons that call your creativity to the surface.
Identify and sprint toward the hard part to enjoy the rewards that those other timid souls can only daydream about while they're staying busy doing the easy part.

Automakers to Trump: Please set one mileage standard

Texto completo: Automakers, including two from Detroit, sent a direct letter to President Donald Trump pleading that he set one national standard for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions.
In the letter provided by the Alliance of Automobile Manufactures, 17 automakers, including General Motors and Ford Motor Co., said they want improved fuel economy and emissions standards. But they warn that if Trump changes the standards without broad support from states, particularly California, it could lead to an extended period of litigation and regulatory uncertainty.
But one standard would "preserve vehicle affordability and help advance our shared national interest in America's manufacturing and innovation leadership. Striking the proper balance will not be easy, but we know with your leadership it can happen."
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did not sign the letter, which was first referenced by the New York Times.
Ford deferred comment to industry spokespeople. GM issued a statement:
"We continue to prioritize the need for one national program and remain hopeful that the parties can find a solution to achieve this goal. Regardless of the standards, we are committed to a future of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion. The pathway to that vision includes continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an all-electric future."
FCA says it supports improved fuel economy but says regulations need to be based on market realities, such as the fact that many consumers have shifted their purchases from cars to SUVs.
A statement issued by FCA said: "Our position on one national program and the mid-term evaluation remains unchanged. It was made clear when we were one of just two automakers to testify last September at hearings held by the EPA and NHTSA."
Until the Trump administration froze fuel economy standards, the U.S. government had expected carmakers to achieve an estimated fuel economy average of 54.5 mpg by 2025. Those rules could return under a Democratic administration. "What works best for consumers, communities, and the millions of U.S. employees that work in the auto industry is one national standard that is practical, achievable, and consistent across the 50 states," the letter stated. "In addition, our customers expect continuous improvements in safety, efficiency, and capability. For these reasons, we support a unified standard that both achieves year-over-year improvements in fuel economy and facilitates the adoption of vehicles with alternative powertrains."
The automakers urge Trump to reopen negotiations on the planned rollback saying that market conditions have changed "materially since 2011. Relative to expectations, fuel prices are far lower, consumers are buying more SUVs and pickups, and the adoption rate of alternative powertrain vehicles has been slower than anticipated."
The letter is the industry's most vocal rally to date against Trump's effort to weaken the rules set by President Barack Obama as part of his fight against climate change.
White House spokesman Judd Deere said, "As we acknowledged earlier this year, (California Air Resources Board) failed to put forward a productive alternative, and we are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles."
Asked about the letter, industry analyst Jeremy Acevedo of Edmunds said automakers may have "bit off more than they could chew" when they asked Trump to reconsider the Obama-era CAFE standards. "This letter in some ways represents ceding defeat to California and the CARB states, but it proves how desperate automakers are to avoid having two different fuel economy standards," he said by email. "While automakers may not want to meet these aggressive targets, at least it's something they can plan for, as opposed to years of uncertainty waiting out a lengthy court battle."

The College Board's crude new tool

Texto completo: The earnest improvers at the College Board, which administers the SAT, should ponder Abraham Maslow's law of the instrument. In 1966, Maslow, a psychologist, said essentially this: If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. The College Board wants to solve a complex social problem that it and its test are unsuited to solve.
The College Board has embraced a dubious idea that might have the beneficial effect of prompting college admissions officers to think of better ideas for broadening their pool of applicants. The idea is to add to the scores of some test-takers an "environmental context" bonus. Strangely, board president David Coleman told the Wall Street Journal's Daniel Henninger that this is not, as the media has named it, an "adversity index." But it is: It purports to measure 15 factors (e.g., poverty or food-stamp eligibility, crime rates, disorderly schools, broken families, families with education deficits, etc.) where these test-takers are situated. Coleman more convincingly says to the New York Times: "This is about finding young people who do a great deal with what they've been given."
Perhaps the board's evident discomfort with the label "adversity score" is because its more benign-sounding "environmental context" gives a social- science patina to the obverse of a category (and political accusation) currently in vogue, that of "privilege." By whatever name, however, the SAT's new metric is another step down the path of identity politics, assigning applicants to groups and categories, and another step away from evaluating individuals individually. But if the adversity metric becomes a substitute for schools emphasizing race, this will be an improvement on explicit racial categories that become implicit quotas.
The SAT was created partly to solve the problem of inequitable standards in college admissions. They too often rewarded nonacademic attributes (e.g., "legacies" - the children of alumni). And they facilitated the intergenerational transmission of inherited privileges. Most importantly, they were used to disfavor certain groups, particularly Jews.
By making an objective - meaning standardized - test one component of schools' assessments of applicants, it advanced the American ideal of a meritocracy open to all talents. However, it has always been the schools' prerogative to decide the importance of the SAT component relative to others. And as "diversity" (understood in various ways) becomes an increasing preoccupation of schools, the SAT becomes decreasingly important.
Any adversity index derived from this or that social "context," however refined, will be an extremely crude instrument for measuring - guessing, actually - the academic prospects of individuals in those contexts. It might, however, be a good gauge of character. Physicists speak of the "escape velocity" of particles circling in an orbit. Perhaps the adversity index can indicate individuals who, by their resilience, have achieved velocity out of challenging social environments.
But the SAT is a flimsy tool for shaping the world of social inertia. Articulate, confident parents from the professions will transmit cultural advantages to their children - advantages that, as the SAT will record them, are apt to dwarf "adversity" bonuses. As Andrew Ferguson, author of the grimly hilarious "Crazy U: One Dad's Crash Course in Getting His Kid Into College," says, America's least diverse classes are SAT-prep classes.
The Chicago Tribune warns, plausibly, that the "secret-sauce" of the SAT's adversity score - schools will know it, applicants will not - will "breed more public mistrust" of colleges' admissions processes. But calling, as the Tribune does, for more "transparency" implies that the more admissions' criteria are made public, the better. However, private deliberations and criteria about applicants protect the applicants' privacy interests. Furthermore, asserting a public interest in maximum transparency encourages government supervision of - and the inevitable shrinking of - schools' discretion in shaping their student bodies and ensuring that some cohorts are not largely excluded.
Unquestionably, such discretion often is employed in unsavory ways to serve academia's fluctuating diversity obsessions, some of which contravene common understandings of equity and perhaps civil rights laws and norms. Soon a Boston court will render a decision, probably destined for Supreme Court review, in the case concerning Harvard's "holistic" metrics, beyond "objective" ones (secondary school transcripts, standardized tests), for - it is alleged - the purpose of restricting the admission of Asian Americans. They, like the Jews whose academic proficiency was a "problem" eight decades ago, often come from family cultures that stress academic attainments.
Caution, however, is in order. Further breaking higher education to the saddle of the state is an imprudent (and, which is much the same thing, unconservative) objective.

Texto completo: After a five-month national search, Theater Mu has selected Lily Tung Crystal as its new artistic director. Crystal is a well-traveled Renaissance woman who most recently worked as a director, actor and theater founder in the Bay Area. She begins her new role with the 27-year-old company in September.
Crystal "brings both artistic and organizational expertise to our team that will enhance our mission and values for years to come," said board chair Reginaldo Reyes in a statement.
A Los Angeles native with an English degree from Cornell University, Crystal spent the 1990s working as a freelance journalist in Shanghai. She covered arts and culture for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, NBC News and Public Radio International's "The World," among others. She also launched Shanghai Talk, a publication she called the city's first English language magazine. Meanwhile, Crystal also acted on stages in China, most notably as Amanda in No«l Coward's "Private Lives."
Crystal worked in media on her return to the U.S., all the while keeping a sideline in theater and earning certification as a leadership coach from California's Hudson Institute. She also worked as a writer and producer for the 2015 film "Steve Jobs."
In 2010, she co-founded Ferocious Lotus Theatre Company, built to nurture and expand Asian-American stage talent in the Bay Area.
"Theater is the hobby that became a job," she said during a recent visit to the Twin Cities to look for housing.
Crystal succeeds Randy Reyes, who was fired by the Theater Mu board in December due to unspecified misconduct (no relation to board chair Reginaldo Reyes). We caught up with the incoming artistic director in between appointments. The conversation was lightly edited.
Q: You have been around the world. Have you been to Minnesota before now?
A: Yes. In 2005, I spent 10 days here. I used to work for GM at the car shows as a product specialist and presenter. I came here for the Minneapolis Auto Show. It was super cold.
Q: And now you are coming to lead Theater Mu after a rupture. Is part of your mission to heal the organization?
A: Yes. I don't know a lot about what happened at Mu. I have pieces of the story, and that the community is fractured. I would say part of my charge is to come into the community and listen and empathize and also make decisions to try to reunite those factions.
I'm also a leadership coach, so I know that, baseline, any transition in leadership is difficult. We, as human beings, are resistant to change. And because organizations are made of human beings, they're resistant to change. If I came under quote-unquote normal circumstances, I would come in, meet with people, listen to them, and find out what they've liked about Theater Mu and what their challenges are. Then I would take that forward with Shannon [Fitzgerald, managing director]. That's part of my charge.
Q: As a leadership coach, you must have a keen awareness of the pitfalls inherent in the job?
A: There are some leaders who make decisions but don't listen. There are some who can't make decisions. Every leader has their strengths, and their strengths also have dark sides. One of my strengths is to listen but also make tough choices.
Q: Theater Mu helped to develop the Asian-American canon nationally and to build the talent pool in the Twin Cities. Will that continue?
A: Mu has done an amazing job of cultivating a pool of actors who can get work on a national scale. From what I hear, there are fewer API [Asian-Pacific Islander] designers and directors. In the Bay Area, I can name 10 API directors, and there's a huge pool of designers. So, yes, I will continue to nurture the actor pool but also nurture designers, dramaturgs, directors. I don't have to direct all the shows. For me, the most successful companies have multiple directors and multiple perspectives. And they're also building the next generation.
Q: Theater used to be your hobby, now it's your career. Have you taken up other hobbies?
A: I started rock-climbing recently and it's almost spiritual for me. One thing I love about theater, love being onstage, is that you have to be totally in the moment. People tend to think in the present and the past. But if you're climbing a rock, you only have to think about what's in front of you.
Q: Tell us about your family.
A: My husband [Eric Crystal] plays sax, piano, guitar and melodica for Boz Scaggs. He loves to cook, which is good, because I can't cook. We have a son, who's 10. I'm a huge arts lover. That's where my passions lie.

Texto completo: The party isn’t over for the Warriors but the fun is.
You know this thing has gone off the tracks if you’re the wife of the owner, sitting courtside next to the ultimate rapper power couple, when you lean across Beyoncé to ask Jay-Z if you can get him a lime in his vodka and soda … and are vilified globally.
That’s what happened to Nicole Curran, the wife of Warriors owner Joe Lacob, in Game 3 of the Finals when fans of Beyoncé – known as the Beyhive – decided the video showed their idol’s space being invaded, setting off a viral maelstrom, which, a tearful Curran said, included death threats.
In fact, nothing bad had happened, as confirmed by Beyoncé’s spokesperson who asked fans to “spread love, not hate.”
Unfortunately, all that was spreading that night for the Warriors was pain. Minority owner Mark Stevens, also sitting courtside, pushed away Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, who was chasing a loose ball, then, when Lowry protested, cursed at him.
The NBA barred Stevens for a year, fined him $500,000 and may force him to sell his 7% of the team.
Nor did Game 3 go so hot for the team. The injury-plagued Warriors were totally outclassed by the Raptors, a heretofore little-known crew that had avoided overtime in Game 7 of the second round with the stumbling 76ers on Kawhi Leonard’s shot that bounced four times on the rim … then was thought to be toast after trailing the Bucks 2-0 in the Eastern Conference Finals.
The Raptors led Game 3 for 46:35 of 48 minutes, winning 123-109 as Warriors Coach Steve Kerr took out his starters with 1:37 left, a surrender rarely seen in the Finals.
Remember when the Warriors were the adorable dynasty with cute Steph Curry and his band of merry marksmen?
Remember when they seemed invincible … like last week?
Then, out of nowhere, came this unexpected death struggle, capping a four-year glory run in which the Warriors once posted a record 73-9 finish and then landed Kevin Durant … won three titles, blowing a fourth in 2016 after leading 3-1 … then for the maraschino cherry atop the sundae of their magnificence, got DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal.
Unfortunately for them, or fortunately for fans who tired of their domination and self-inflation, it seemed as if the gods had also had enough of the Warriors, whose starters began disappearing even as they went 12-4 in the West draw.
April 15: Cousins goes out in Game 2 in the opening round against the Clippers.
May 8: Durant is lost in Game 5 in the second round against the Rockets.
June 2: Klay Thompson and Kevin Looney go down in Game 2 of the Finals.
June 5: Raptors go up 2-1 as Curran offers Jay-Z a lime and Stevens reaches out and touches someone. Warriors haters just wish it had involved Lacob, the majority owner, who tipped off his self-importance after winning his first title, telling the New York Times his team was “light years” ahead of the others.
Not that a merely 2-1 deficit discouraged the Warriors. With Thompson returning for Game 4, they expected to lock this up in six games … with them as champions, of course.
“We just gotta continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6, and celebrate,” said Draymond Green, team braggart. “Fun times ahead.”
Oops.
June 7: Klay goes for 28 points in Game 4 but they fall again. Once again, it isn’t close, with the Raptors winning 105-92.
With KD hoping to make it back for Game 5, the Warriors now expect to pull this one out in seven.
Win or lose, they’re going into a new arena in San Francisco next season, in which their fans, known for enthusiastically backing the team in the bad times, will have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in personal seat licenses as well as the standard exorbitant ticket prices.
So they may have already played their last game in friendly little Oracle Arena … which their loyal fans commemorated by fleeing up the aisles before it was over.
To give them their due, the Warriors really have been special.
They haven’t just been good but entertaining, sparking a revolution in offense. Curry is surely the greatest shooter in NBA history. Steph and Klay are surely the best shooting backcourt. The Steph-Klay-KD combination is one of the NBA’s greatest.
They’re also nice people. Kerr is a great quote and a super-nice man. Curry is said to be as wonderful a person as he is a player. For all KD’s whining, he’s considered a nice guy. For all Green’s braggadocio, he’s an unfailing stand-up guy who never uses the dodge of blaming his latest outrage on the press.
Lacob deserves his share of credit. It was his idea to hire Jerry West as a consultant, making the Warriors the first team to pay over $1 million for a part-timer … which turned out to be a bargain. If Jeanie Buss had been as savvy as Lacob when West was looking to rejoin her team, the Lakers might be in far better shape.
In the biggest “unfortunately” for the Warriors, more is at stake than one title.
The season has been played under the shadow of Durant’s ambition after he turned down a $150 million extension for a one-year deal to become a free agent this summer.
Insiders have paired Durant and Boston’s Kyrie Irving all season. Now with reports that Kyrie is leaning toward signing with the Nets … and Brooklyn trading salary to get a second maximum slot … the KD Leaves scenario looks ever more real.
It’s not over yet for the Warriors, but we’re about to see how many light years ahead they are now.

Abogados trabajan como taxistas de Uber y meseros para sobrevivir a los costos de Nueva York

Texto completo: Nadie escapa a los precios exorbitante de la ciudad y el estado más caros de EEUU. Ni siquiera los profesionales. Irónicamente, muchos abogados que tratan de ayudar a quienes no tienen dinero, deben buscar un segundo ingreso para poder costear el trabajo que donan y/o cubrir sus deudas universitarias.
Según Jared Trujillo, presidente de la Asociación de Abogados de Ayuda Legal (The Legal Aid Society) , al menos un tercio de sus colegas allí a tiempo completo, tienen empleos adicionales las noches o los fines de semana. Y dos tercios deben una deuda de préstamos estudiantiles de al menos $200 mil dólares.
Danielle, por ejemplo, entrega comida para Grubhub y UberEats, y ayuda a personas con sus declaraciones de impuestos. Su colega Julia Boms acude a los tribunales en los días hábiles, y los fines de semana trabaja atendiendo una barra, como en sus tiempos de estudiante.
“Fui a la escuela para hacer esto”, comentó irónicamente la joven de 28 años a The New York Times. A pesar de tener además una maestría en psicología forense, vive en un apartamento compartido con dos personas más en Murray Hill, en Manhattan.
Otros colegas suyos son meseros, pasean perros o conducen autos para Uber.
Según un documento interno, The Legal Aid Society, la organización de servicios legales sin fines de lucro más antigua del país , ofrece a los recién graduados salarios iniciales de $53,582 dólares, que aumentan a $62,730 al aprobar el examen estatal del colegio de abogados.
En contraste, el salario promedio de los abogados de primer año en firmas privadas fue $135 mil dólares en 2017, según la asociación NALP.
Los ejecutivos de The Legal Aid reconocen que los salarios relativamente bajos son un obstáculo para reclutar y retener a abogados fuertes, especialmente en Nueva York.
No buscan competir con los salarios del sector privado. Su objetivo es alcanzar la paridad con los abogados en el Departamento Legal de la ciudad, que paga aproximadamente $108 mil dólares a profesionales con 10 años de experiencia. Los de The Legal Aid con experiencia similar ganan alrededor de $90 mil.
En una audiencia reciente en el Concejo Municipal, funcionarios de The Legal Aid destacaron la disparidad salarial ante los líderes que han propuesto otorgar a las organizaciones de servicios legales financiados por la ciudad $15 millones de dólares adicionales en el presupuesto 2019-20 para ayudar a cerrar la brecha salarial. Los abogados dicen que deberían ser $50 millones de dólares.
“El trabajo es difícil porque estás viendo mucha tristeza, mucho dolor”, dijo Janet Sabel, directora ejecutiva y abogada en The Legal Aid. “Ves a personas que están presas, ves a clientes cuyas casas están cubiertas de moho, simplemente estás viendo cosas muy, muy tristes. Queremos que la gente tenga tiempo libre”.
El tema de la baja remuneración para los defensores públicos ha llamado incluso la atención de la senadora Kamala Harris de California, quien busca la nominación Demócrata para presidente.
Harris dijo el mes pasado que presentaría un proyecto de ley que establecería la paridad salarial entre los defensores públicos y los fiscales de todo el país en un plazo de cinco años.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio, un Demócrata que también se está postulando a la presidencia, no se ha comprometido con el posible aumento a los abogados de The Legal Aid. Un portavoz de la alcaldía, Raúl Contreras, dijo que “las conversaciones con el Concejo sobre este tema están en curso”.
Mientras, en NYC los alquileres de vivienda han alcanzado precios históricos.

Newly Opened Four Seasons To Close Down

Texto completo: Less than a year after the Four Seasons Restaurant opened in its new location on East 49th Street in Manhattan, it is shutting its doors. The restaurant once known for the power lunch will close after lunch service on Tuesday.
In an email statement, Alex von Bidder, the managing partner, said: "Regretfully, after nearly 60 years, the Four Seasons Restaurant will close the week of June 10th. We have been privileged to work with one of the finest culinary teams and outstanding staff that has stayed with us through some challenging times over the course of our history."
By phone, Mr. von Bidder added that he thought the new restaurant was great, looked great and had a great team in place. "But we just couldn't make it; the restaurant world has changed," he said.
He said that investors had made the decision to close. "We were not doing enough business to satisfy them," he said.
Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family had established the original Four Seasons and who had been closely involved with the business, said he thought it would be worth a try to keep the brand going when the restaurant lost its lease in the Seagram Building, in 2016, after the developer Aby Rosen took over. "We thought we had an outstanding place with great food, but we just couldn't attract the clientele," he said.
With a group of investors footing the $ 30 million price tag, Mr. von Bidder and his then-partner of many years, Julian Niccolini, opened a newly built version of the restaurant three blocks away from the original location last August.
In mid-December, Mr. Niccolini was removed from his position related to allegations of sexual misconduct. Asked whether the forced resignation of Mr. Niccolini might have had an effect, Mr. von Bidder said, "That's hard to measure."
When the restaurant first opened in 1959 in the Seagram Building, it was a game-changer in New York, if not the nation, for its design and food. The space, which was designated a local landmark in 1989, was the work of the architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. (Mr. Johnson had a regular table at lunch for decades.) Every element, including the bread bowls, was the product of an important American designer. Over the years, the space was adorned with works by artists like Pablo Picasso, James Rosenquist and Richard Lippold, who made the sculpture that hung over the bar in the Grill Room.
Under the stewardship of a series of restaurateurs and chefs, most notably Joe Baum, Tom Margittai, Paul Kovi, Seppi Renggli, Mr. Niccolini and Mr. von Bidder, the Four Seasons also set a high standard for American cuisine, which had previously lacked prestige. Long before anyone spoke of farm-to-table cooking, seasonal food drove the Four Seasons. (The concept is embedded in its very name.) Influential figures in the culinary world, including James Beard and Mimi Sheraton, helped shape the menu. The composer John Cage foraged mushrooms for the kitchen.
The fact that the famous power lunch was said to have been born at the Four Seasons only cemented the restaurant's status.
The new version of the restaurant, which had a barroom and a dining room but no pool, had a young chef, Diego Garcia, in the kitchen and Bill Yosses, a former White House pastry chef, doing the desserts. Pete Wells, chief restaurant critic of The New York Times, reviewed the restaurant in early December, downgrading it from two stars to one.

Texto completo: A total of 10,509 essays, 42 judges, five rounds of judging -- and roughly 4,700,000 student-written words all told.
Those are this spring's stats for a contest that has grown every year since it began in 2014. Below, we're honoring the 70 teenagers -- 11 winners, 27 runners-up and 32 honorable mentions -- whose essays shone brightest round after round. We're also shouting out an additional 50 who almost made it to the winners' circle, no small thing in a contest this competitive. You can read the work of the winners and runners-up in this column starting June 3, when we'll be publishing three new pieces each school day.
The best thing about this challenge is that it spotlights teenage takes on the real-world issues that most affect their lives, from the college admissions scandal to climate change, social media to sex education, guns to grade point averages, voting to vaping.
But we also love how it introduces us to fresh ideas, including, this year, the need to eat more bugs, end toxic trash talk in gaming, be wary of the "self-care" trend, and give pineapple pizza the respect at least one student thinks it deserves.
As they publish, we hope that, like us, you'll find that the pieces grab your attention and hold it to the end. We hope you'll admire how they make solid and compelling arguments in a mere 450 words, and do it not as dry summaries of pros and cons, but with real voice. But mostly we hope that, as we do every year, you'll learn something new.

Texto completo: "Protecting the Shield" — an investigative series on police accountability by the Asbury Park Press — won an award from the New York City Deadline Club, one of the most competitive regional journalism competitions in the country.
The winners were announced earlier this month in a ceremony at the Harvard Club of New York City which featured a talk by New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Other winners included work from The New York Times, The Associated Press, Reuters, CNN and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
The Press' 2018 series won in the category for reporting by newspapers with a circulation under 100,000. The Deadline Club is the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
"Protecting the Shield" revealed tens of millions of dollars spent to hush allegations of police abuse, including claims of injury and wrongful death. The series exposed systemic flaws that allowed bad cops to flourish and prompted two statewide policy changes: random drug testing for all police officers and an internal affairs reform that increased oversight of cops.
The series was written by Andrew Ford, Kala Kachmar, Susanne Cervenka, Alex Gecan, Ken Serrano and Paul D'Ambrosio. The project was edited by Executive Editor D'Ambrosio. The online version of the story was designed by Digital Innovator Felecia Wellington Radel with social outreach by Engagement Editor Courtney Marabella. Videos were done by Ford, Kachmar and Thomas P. Costello, with editing by Ryan Ross.
"Protecting the Shield" won several journalism prizes this year, including national awards:
American Bar Association Silver Gavel Award – a national award for outstanding reporting on legal issues.
Livingston Award – Ford was chosen as a finalist for a national award for reporting by journalists under age 35 for selections from the series.
National Headliner award – a video, which you can see at the top of this story, won a third-place prize in this national competition.
New Jersey Press Association's public service prize – the series won the top journalism prize in New Jersey.
USA Today Network competition – The series, main video and web design were named finalists in three categories of the national competition — public service, video and design.

Texto completo: YouTube said Wednesday that it is launching a new campaign to rid its site of extremist political and personal videos, such as those promoting white supremacy and neo-Nazism, as the video publishing platform seeks to crack down on hate speech.
YouTube, which is owned by Google, laid out the guidelines of its latest crackdown in a company blog post. No specific video producers or channels were named, but YouTube said that "videos that promote or glorify Nazi ideology" would be targeted under the new policies.
"(We are) specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status," YouTube said in announcing its latest effort to police content on its site. The company added that it would also begin removing videos that deny that violent events like the Holocaust and the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
YouTube said it would begin enforcing the new video policies on Wednesday, but the size of the issue means that "it will take time for our systems to fully ramp up and we'll be gradually expanding coverage over the next several months."
The size of YouTube speaks to the scale of the task at hand for the company. Approximately 1.3 billion people around the globe use YouTube, and more than 5 billion videos are watched on the site each day. It's also estimated that 300 to 500 new videos are uploaded onto YouTube every minute.
YouTube's latest move against hate speech comes one day after the company determined that videos posted by conservative YouTuber Steven Crowder, in which he used racial and homophobic language to described Vox writer Carlos Maza, didn't violate You- Tube's policy usage terms. A report this week from the New York Times also described the proliferation of home videos that include images of children in swimsuits as a "buffet" for pedophiles.

Daily on Healthcare, presented by the Alzheimer’s Association: Trump administration restricts research on fetal tissue from abortions

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RESTRICTS RESEARCH ON FETAL TISSUE FROM ABORTIONS: The Trump administration will block government scientists from acquiring new fetal tissue from abortions to use in medical research, a major victory for abortion opponents.
The decision comes after months of speculation, as well as backlash from anti-abortion groups that demanded President Trump fire the head of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, for saying that research using fetal tissue could provide useful study for treatments of devastating illnesses.
The ban applies to scientists at NIH, the government's medical research agency, and would not apply to fetal tissue obtained from miscarriages, but to fetal tissue that was donated after elected abortions. The Department of Health and Human Services, which is the NIH's parent agency, in September had already asked most government scientists to temporarily halt the acquisition of new fetal tissue while it reviewed the issue.
The new ban does not apply to outside groups that receive NIH grants to conduct their research, though HHS did announce it would not be renewing a multi-million dollar contract with the University of California, San Francisco, that used fetal tissue in HIV research.
The contract has been renewed every 90 days since the end of September as federal officials have reviewed it, but it won't be extended past Wednesday, when it was set to expire.
UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood said in a statement that the university "strongly opposed" the "abrupt" decision, and said the scientists specifically required fetal tissue to conduct their research.
"UCSF exercised appropriate oversight and complied with all state and federal laws," Hawgood said. "We believe this decision to be politically motivated, shortsighted and not based on sound science."
From now on, other outside researchers who get government funding will undergo an ethical review process by an NIH advisory board when they apply to have their grants renewed.

CONSERVATIVE GROUPS START COALITION AGAINST ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: A new group to oppose the creation of a fully government-financed healthcare system formed Thursday under the name Coalition Against Socialized Medicine. The coalition includes American Commitment, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Club for Growth, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action for America, and the National Taxpayers Union.
The coalition said its mission was to “educate the public and aggressively oppose all efforts to advance socialized medicine, and instead promote market-oriented initiatives that will spur even greater innovations and improvements to our American healthcare system.”
MEASLES CASES SURPASS 1,000 AND AZAR URGES PARENTS TO VACCINATE: HHS Secretary Alex Azar urged all Americans to vaccinate against measles Wednesday as the confirmed number of cases reached 1,001. Azar said that surpassing the 1,000-mark is “a troubling reminder” that pockets of the population remain unvaccinated.
BIDEN SUPPORTS BAN ON FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS: Joe Biden’s campaign team said Wednesday that the Democratic contender supports the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for certain abortions. Biden is the sole Democratic candidate to have come out in support of the ban. Many 2020 candidates, including Sens. Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren, have all vowed to repeal the restriction.
OPIOID MANUFACTURER TO PAY $225 MIL TO END INVESTIGATIONS INTO BRIBES, KICKBACKS: Insys Therapeutics will pay $225 million to end federal investigations into their allegedly illegal marketing tactics for its powerful fentanyl spray Subsys. The spray is designed to treat cancer patients in severe pain, but federal prosecutors say Insys bribed doctors and offered kickbacks to prescribe the drug more frequently.
MEDICAID ILLEGALLY PURCHASED ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION DRUGS FOR SEX OFFENDERS: A state audit revealed that the New York Medicaid system made $993,000 in payments for erectile dysfunction drugs, providing 47 state sex offenders with sexual treatments. While Medicaid will cover such drugs used to treat certain diagnoses, state auditors argued that the cases did not warrant the prescriptions. Health officials deny the charges, saying auditors “either ignored the law or the facts which undermines any value that can be associated with its findings.”
UN OFFICIAL CALLS US ABORTION POLICY ‘TORTURE’: The U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights, Kate Gilmore, called increasingly stringent abortion bans “torture” and “extremist hate” against women. She also said the groups pushing stricter laws, which are largely conservative and religious, are ignoring science in favor of pushing their ideological agendas.
N.C. HOUSE FAILS TO BLOCK GOVERNOR’S VETO OF ‘BORN ALIVE’ BILL: North Carolina’s GOP-led House failed to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of a bill requiring doctors to provide medical care for infants who survive abortions. Medical professionals who do not comply with the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would have faced felony charges, prison time, and up to $250,000 in fines. The veto override failed in a 67-53 vote Wednesday.
STACEY ABRAMS URGES HOLLYWOOD NOT TO CUT TIES WITH GEORGIA OVER ABORTION LAW: Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who lost her bid for Georgia governor, wants production companies, including Disney, Netflix, and WarnerMedia, to continue working in Georgia despite an abortion ban. She and other business leaders have begun a “#StayAndFight” movement to urge the companies to put their financial backing behind political candidates and groups challenging the law.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CUTS ENGLISH CLASSES FOR UNACCOMPANIED MINORS IN SHELTERS: The Office of Refugee Resettlement will discontinue English language lessons, recreational activities, and legal aid for unaccompanied migrant children in federal shelters. HHS spokesman Mark Weber said the programs are “not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety, including education services, legal services, and recreation.”
OHIO DOCTOR FACES 25 COUNTS OF MURDER IN OVERDOSE DEATHS: Dr. William Husel of Ohio is accused of killing 25 patients, mostly elderly or severely ill, after prescribing between 500 and 2,000 micrograms of fentanyl several times to each person while working for the Mount Carmel Health System. A typical dose is between 25 to 500 micrograms.

Texto completo: El sistema de recomendaciones de videos de YouTube facilita que los pedófilos hallen videos de niños , denunció un equipo de investigadores que analizó el algoritmo.
Los investigadores afirman que YouTube escoge videos de todos sus archivos, a veces incluso de películas caseras inocuas de familias que no son conscientes de ello . En muchos casos, el algoritmo refería a los usuarios a los videos después de ver contenido de temática sexual .
El algoritmo de Youtube usa inteligencia artificial y es el responsable del 70% de las reproducciones de videos en la plataforma.
“Es el algoritmo de YouTube que conecta estos canales”, dijo a The New York Times Jonas Kaiser, uno de los tres investigadores del Centro Berkman Klein para Internet y la Sociedad de Harvard que examinó los videos mientras investigaba el impacto de YouTube en Brasil . “Eso es lo que da miedo”.
Así le sucedió a Christiane, una mujer brasileña. El video de su hija y una amiguita jugando en una piscina en el patio de la casa llegó a acumular unas 400 mil vistas.
En febrero YouTube deshabilitó los comentarios en los videos con niños , luego de que varios medios reportaron que eran usados como guía por los pedófilos.
Sin embargo, el sistema de recomendaciones -que usa el mismo algoritmo agrupa- decenas de dichos videos en un nuevo depósito, de fácil acceso, a disposición de una amplia audiencia.
Los pedófilos no necesitan buscar directamente videos de niños, sino que el sistema los va dirigiendo a ellos mediante una cadena de recomendaciones .
Por ejemplo, un pedófilo puede buscar videos de mujeres jóvenes y a partir de allí terminar viendo videos de niñas .
The New York Times alertó a YouTube de que su sistema hacía circular videos familiares entre personas con inclinaciones al parecer pedófilas y la compañía retiró varios de ellos, pero dejó otros , incluso algunos subidos por cuentas aparentemente falsas.
Pese a las críticas, YouTube mantiene su sistema de recomendaciones en videos de niños, a pesar de los pedidos de que lo desactive para disuadir a los pedófilos de buscar materiales sobre menores en la plataforma.

Resumen: Democratic presidential candidates argue that we have 'rights' to education, jobs and health care. Those are goals, not rights, and they should say so.

Texto completo: In announcing her candidacy in January, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, "I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college. " That's an admirable goal, but it's not a right, at least not yet. Most of us know our legal rights, beginning with those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, press and religion. They extend to protections such as due process and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
What about such things as safe streets, functional utilities and preserved parks? As citizens we deserve them, but they are not among our legal rights.
Conflating moral objectives, sometimes referred to as "natural rights," with legal rights is trending. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweets, "Health care is a human right," she hurts the argument that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , are making on behalf of "Medicare for All. " Health care is vital, but it's not a right, at least not in the United States. The obvious proof is the fact that many Democrats are striving to make it one.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has introduced legislation to establish a federal jobs guarantee program. He believes that every American has the right to a job, "and that right has only become more important," he maintains, in an age of income inequality and discrimination.
Rights have expanded through history
Government guarantees are often called economic rights or positive rights — benefits, such as Social Security, to which citizens can claim a legal right. In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed a "Second Bill of Rights," including jobs, education and medical care, the very things candidates are advocating today. He called them "new goals of human happiness and well-being. "
It was not clear whether FDR, who died the following year, was speaking of actual, enforceable rights or merely guideposts for a better society. He proposed "the right of every family to a decent home," but he stopped short of guaranteeing such a right by having government pay for the homes.
In today's politics, semantics matter, and inaccurately describing ambitious policies is a red flag. The undecided voter might reasonably say, "Persuade me, but don't claim something is a right when it's not. " Some conservatives fear costly "entitlements" and reject the notion that discretionary government spending can be lumped with our inalienable rights.
At the start of this decade, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that access to water is a human right. That seems eminently more reasonable than suggesting we are somehow entitled to universal pre-K.
Some things aren't rights but should be
To be clear, several legitimate rights have been challenged recently, despite laws and court decisions that support them. A woman's right to choose is being threatened and should be defended in state legislatures and in the courts. Voter suppression poses a risk to our electoral freedom, and we must take whatever steps needed to protect the right to vote. Women's rights to equal pay and opportunity, LBGTQ rights to marry and serve in the military — they, too, are established rights.
An interesting example of the power of words was seen recently in The New York Times, where an opinion writer stated flatly that child care is a "fundamental right. " Editors crafting the print-edition headline wisely inserted the word "should. " That made it "Child Care Should Be a Right" and gave readers a proper headline over an improperly worded op-ed. It's a distinction that makes a difference.
Candidates would be more convincing if they argued that things such as pre-K and employment "ought to be a right," or "deserve to be a right. " Alternatively, they could choose to remain silent, which is after all their Miranda rights.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Thomas Edison’s great-grandson wants you to stop using the incandescent lightbulb.
On Thursday afternoon, Barry Edison Sloane, one of Thomas Edison’s great-grandchildren, took part in a press conference with Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N. J. , to call on the Trump administration to stop a rollback of lightbulb efficiency standards that would have all but phased out the lightbulb Edison played a role in inventing. Pallone chairs the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Department of Energy.
Sloane slammed the rollback, saying, “It’s unacceptable that the Department of Energy now intends to disregard commonsense innovations that have already been embraced in 80 countries and the U. S. for over a decade. Edison would have agreed that, given the urgency climate change presents, this kind of action is like throwing gasoline on our burning house. "

Edison is generally credited as one of the inventors who helped make incandescent lightbulbs commercially viable in the United States. He patented his designs for lightbulbs in 1879 and 1880, and went on to create the first modern electric utility when he opened the Pearl Street Station in New York City in 1882.
“This reckless rollback will lead to years of unnecessary electricity generation and carbon emissions – just to power inefficient and outdated lightbulbs,” said Pallone. “Trashing this important standard will also increase consumers’ electricity bills by allowing inefficient products to remain on the market, something that is absolutely unnecessary,”
Pallone told USA TODAY that he and Sloane were holding the press conference to “call out” the Trump administration for its regulatory rollback, though no legislation or lawsuits were planned at the time to stop the Department of Energy’s actions. According to Pallone's office, this regulatory rollback would "increase consumers’ electricity bills by $12 billion a year by the year 2025. "
In March 2019, the Department of Energy announced that it planned to withdraw an Obama-era rule that would have effectively ended the sale of all incandescent bulbs — including “decorative” bulbs that had previously been exempt. Advocates of the policy rollback had argued the Obama rule was necessary for energy conservation.

Lightbulb industry groups had opposed the Obama-era rules.
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association, which represents companies like Siemens, General Electric, and Signify, formerly Philips Lighting, wrote in a release when the Department of Energy issued its proposed rollback that “consumers, retailers, and manufacturers have, without government regulation, already driven energy savings in the general service lamp category far faster than anyone could have imagined just a few years ago. ”
Edison’s descendants have been vocal, though, in their desire for technological change.
In an April 2019 New York Times op-ed, Barry Edison Sloane and J. Heywood Edison Sloane wrote that “Our great-grandfather’s lightbulb helped change the world. But it’s almost 140 years old and it’s time to modernize. Thomas Edison would have been the first to say so. ”

Shelters to Curb Playtime And Classes for Children

Texto completo: The Trump administration said Wednesday that it would begin restricting or canceling education, legal aid and playground recreation for migrant children housed in government shelters as a result of financial constraints created by the "crisis at the border."
The government's plans were swiftly rebuked by civil rights lawyers representing unaccompanied children, who have been crossing the border in ever-larger numbers this year to flee poverty and violence in their home countries, mainly in Central America. And the chief of at least one large shelter operator said he would continue to offer education and sports at his network's facilities.
Some 13,200 migrant children, including adolescents who crossed the border alone and young children who were separated from their parents, are currently housed in more than 100 shelters across the country. They receive English instruction, as well as math, civics and other classes. Most facilities have a sports field and allow children to go outside, often to play soccer, at least once a day.
The Health and Human Services Department said in a statement that its Office of Refugee Resettlement, responsible for housing migrant minors, had "instructed grantees to begin scaling back or discontinuing awards for U.A.C. (unaccompanied minor) activities that are not directly necessary for the protection of life and safety, including education services, legal services, and recreation."
The department said that additional resources were urgently required for "critical" child welfare and for more beds to accommodate the swelling number of migrant youths arriving in the United States.
The statement, released by Evelyn Stauffer, a department spokeswoman, said that the administration had alerted Congress more than a month ago of its funding crunch and that it had sought $ 2.88 billion in emergency funding to boost shelter capacity and to avoid any cutbacks in services. The news was first reported by The Washington Post.
Shelter operators last week received an email, shared with The New York Times, that warned of an impending funding deficiency. "The Unaccompanied Children Program is currently operating under a deficiency," it said. "As a result, all costs budgeted for recreational or educational activities are hereby restricted from drawdown." It added that the "restriction applies only to funds awarded" after May 22, 2019, and would remain in effect until further notice.
Civil rights and child welfare advocates said that any move by the government to eliminate education and recreation would constitute a violation of the Flores settlement, which in 1997 established the standards for treating migrant children held in government facilities, and would prompt them to sue for reinstatement of the activities.
"If this administration goes forward with denying education, recreation and other unspecified so-called nonessential services, it would be in flagrant violation of the Flores settlement and will face immediate legal action," said Neha Desai, co-counsel on the settlement decree, who visits government shelters to ensure compliance. She is also the immigration director at the National Center for Youth Law in Oakland, Calif.
"To those of us whose job it is to promote the health and safety of children, this is a shocking directive," said Amy Cohen, a psychiatrist who consults for the Flores team and regularly interviews children at shelters. "It violates every tenet of basic child welfare practice and will further harm the medical and psychological health of children fleeing extraordinarily dangerous circumstances in their home countries."
After being intercepted by Border Patrol, migrant children are sent to government-licensed shelters across the country, where they remain until a sponsor -- typically a relative already living in the United States -- can prove that she or he is fit to care for the child. Nearly 41,000 migrant children have been taken into government custody this fiscal year that began Oct. 1, about 60 percent more than last year. Federal officials have predicted that a record number could arrive by year's end.
Critics of the plan to reduce services said costs had been driven up because children were being held for protracted periods of time, instead of being released to family or friends. The current length of stay, ranging from about 50 to 75 days, is twice as long as it was during the Obama years, according to Dr. Cohen.
"I have interviewed children held for more than a year despite a fully competent and willing family sponsor," Dr. Cohen said. "I interviewed an increasingly desperate child who'd been there for four months despite having a close, safe relative fully prepared to take her."
This is often because of rigorous standards the government imposes before it releases children to a private sponsor. In some cases, sponsors' homes are deemed by government-contracted social workers to be inadequate to receive a child, often because they are very modest. In other cases, potential sponsors, such as aunts and uncles, struggle to prove a pre-existing bond with a child for lack of such items as a photograph -- even when both the child and family members back home confirm a connection.
In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee in April, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said that the system was running out of beds and cautioned that at the current pace of arrivals, available funding would not suffice. "We need help," he said.
Educational and recreational activities ensure that children are engaged during much of the day, and help to avert behavioral problems, shelter operators say. At least one operator said he would resist canceling educational and recreational activities, which were important for the children's well-being.
"We have not and we are not going to curtail recreation and education. We just can't do that," said Kevin Dinnin, president of BCFS, the second-largest shelter network, which houses about 1,000 children in facilities in Texas. "We will have to use reserve funds until the government figures out what they are going to do."

Texto completo: Week of June 5-11
June 5
1872 - The Republican Party National Convention takes place in Philadelphia with substantial representation from former Black slaves. At least three Blacks addressed the national political gathering. At this point in history, the Republicans were the nation's most progressive party and attracted the allegiance of African Americans. Blacks would remain loyal to the Republicans until the 1930s. But by 1945 with the Republicans becoming increasingly conservative and attracted to the New Deal programs of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the vast majority of Blacks had switched to the Democrats.
1894 - Black inventor G.W. Murray patents a fertilizer distributor, cotton chopper and a seed planter all on this day in 1894.
1945 - Track star John Carlos is born in Harlem, N.Y. Carlos and fellow sprinter Tommie Smith created an international sensation when they protested American racism by giving the "Black Power" clinched fist salute when accepting their medals at the 1968 Olympics.
1956 - Although the actual decision may have been reached the previous day, a federal district court hands down a ruling declaring that Alabama laws requiring racial segregation in public transportation were unconstitutional. The decision, which was later confirmed by the United States Supreme Court, was the first major legal victory for the Civil Rights Movement. It grew out of the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott sparked when Rosa Parks defied the law and custom by refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a White man. Although actually organized by Rev. E.D. Nixon, the Boycott would result in Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. becoming the nation's most prominent civil rights leader.
June 6
1790 - Jean Baptist Pointe Du Sable establishes a settlement which would eventually grow into the city of Chicago. The settlement would make the French-speaking, Santo Domingo-born Du Sable a wealthy man.
1958 - Singer, musician and composer Prince was born on this day in Minneapolis, Minn. His full name was Prince Rogers Nelson. He was a musical innovator and known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, extravagant dress and makeup, and wide vocal range. Prince died at his Paisley Park recording studio and home in Chanhassen, Minn., on April 21, 2016, at the age of 57.
1966 - Although there is some debate as to who first coined and used the phrase, this is generally recognized as the day in 1966 that Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee President Stokely Carmichael began to popularize the term "Black Power" as a demand for greater African American control over their political and economic destiny in America.
1987 - Dr. Mae Jemison is selected by NASA as the first Black woman to begin training as a space shuttle astronaut. Jemison actually became the first African-American woman to travel in space on Sept. 12, 1992 aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor.
June 7
1868 - This is generally recognized as the day Marie Laveau retired (or was forced out) as the most powerful Voo Doo priestess in the world. The New Orleans native had become powerful and wealthy catering to the superstitious beliefs of both Blacks and Whites throughout the South. The daughter of a slave and a French plantation owner, Laveau was raised as a Catholic but became intrigued by stories of the city's first Voo Doo priestess Sanite De De and by 1830 had built her own Voo Doo religious empire. She was replaced by one of her daughters, but she would live until 1881 dying at the age of 98.
1917 - One of the greatest poets of the 20th century Gwendolyn Brooks is born in Topeka, Kan. Pushed by her mother and father, Brooks began writing poetry at a young age and was even introduced to some of the best known Black poets and writers of the Harlem Renaissance while still a child. She won the coveted Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1950 for a collection entitled "Annie Allen." She died on Dec. 3, 2000.
1930 - Under pressure from early civil rights activists, the New York Times begins using the word "Negro" as the official designation for African Americans. It also agreed to capitalize the "N." The decision by the Times gradually led to "Negro" becoming the official designation for Blacks nationwide and it would remain so until it was dethroned by "Black" in the 1960s. Positively, the rights advocates were attempting to build greater respect for African Americans but negatively, the selection of "Negro" also reflected a desire not to be referred to as "Blacks."
1953 - Educator and activist Mary Church Terrell wins a legal battle to end segregation in Washington, D.C., restaurants.
June 8
1886 - Homer A. Plessy, a light-complexioned Black man, refuses to leave the "White" section of a New Orleans railroad car and move to the "colored" section. His Rosa Parks type refusal sets in motion a legal case, which eventually reached the United States Supreme Court. In its May 1896 ruling, the Court decided against Plessy and thus confirmed the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal." The ruling also had the effect of treating anyone with any "Black blood" as Black. The court never actually ruled on Plessy's claim that he was 7/8 White and only 1/8 Black and thus should not be treated as "colored" under the laws of that day.
1968 - James Earl Ray, the man convicted of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is captured at an airport in London using a false Canadian passport. Ray would spend the rest of his life trying to withdraw his guilty plea charging that his brother and a mysterious man he met in Montreal, Canada, named Raoul were actually involved in the killing of King. He claimed he "did not personally shoot Dr. King" but suggested he knew beforehand about the conspiracy to assassinate him. Ray died in prison in April 1998.
1982 - One of the greatest athletes to ever play the game of baseball, Satchell Paige, dies in Kansas City, Mo. Paige had played in the old Negro Baseball Leagues and went unrecognized by Major League Baseball and the general public for decades. He was finally voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1971.

1948 - Oliver W. Hill becomes the first African American elected to the Richmond, Va., city council. He is best known for his work as a civil rights attorney helping bring down the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal."

1760 - Several sources list this at the birthday of Richard Allen - founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Other sources give his birth date as Feb. 14, 1760. Regardless, the AME church was the first African-American organized and incorporated church in America. Allen, Absalom Jones and a group of free Blacks in Philadelphia founded the church in 1794. Allen and his group were initially members of the city's predominantly White St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church. But when several Blacks were ejected from the church for attempting to pray alongside Whites, Allen led a walkout, which resulted in the forming of the AME church.
1898 - Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to win an Oscar, is born on this day in Wichita, Kan. She won her Academy Award in 1940 for Best Supporting Actress for the role of Mammy in the classic film "Gone With The Wind." Once criticized for playing stereotypical and sometimes demeaning "Black roles," she responded, "I'd rather play a maid than be one." McDaniel died in 1952.
1941 - The "Black Moses," Marcus Garvey dies in London, England. Starting around 1916, Garvey built his United Negro Improvement Association into the largest mass organization of Blacks in history, with-the slogan "Up You Mighty Race." The UNIA owned businesses ranging from bakeries to shipping companies. Garvey preached Black pride and self-reliance, while steering away from the more integrationist thrust of most prominent Black leaders of his day. He was eventually jailed on what are now viewed as trumped up mail fraud charges. Presidential intervention got Garvey freed. But in exchange for his early release from prison, the Jamaican native had to agree to leave the United States and not return. Separated from his U.S. base, Garvey was never able to rebuild the UNIA.
June 11
1963 - President John F. Kennedy declares during a nationwide radio and television address that segregation was "morally wrong" and told the U.S. Congress it was "time to act" (pass legislation) to end all segregation of the races. That statement and similar ones endeared Kennedy to millions of African-Americans. However, a few months after making the declaration, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. But most of his legislative ideas would be implemented by his successor, President Lyndor B. Johnson.

Texto completo: Carnival Corp., which owns several cruise ships that visit Maine each summer, has agreed to pay a $20 million penalty for continuing to pollute the ocean despite a 2016 conviction for violating federal environmental laws, according to a report by the Associated Press.
In 2017, Florida-based Carnival was fined $40 million after one of its ships, the Caribbean Princess, was determined by federal regulators to have been "making illegal discharges since 2005 using bypass equipment -- including a so-called 'magic pipe' -- to circumvent pollution-prevention equipment that separates oil and monitors oil levels in the ship's water," Reuters reported at the time.
Four other princess ships also were found by federal officials to have "engaged in illegal practices to discharge waste," according to the New York Times.
Carnival was placed on five years probation but continued to dump pollution directly into the ocean, according to a statement released Monday by the U.S. Justice department.
Carnival has admitted that in the past couple of years its ships have broken the law by dumping polluted "gray water" in prohibited places such Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park and knowingly discharging plastic along with food waste in the Bahamas, according to the Associated Press. The company also admitted falsifying compliance documents and other administrative violations such as having cleanup teams visit its ships just before scheduled inspections, AP reported.
In addition to its line of Carnival-named ships and the Princess line, Carnival Corp. also owns the AIDA, Holland America, Cunard, and P&O cruise brands. Ships that sail under those names are scheduled to make more than 70 visits to Maine this year, with 58 scheduled for Bar Harbor and 13 for Portland. The Caribbean Princess -- which used the "magic pipe" to dump untreated pollution into the ocean -- is scheduled to make seven visits to Bar Harbor this summer and one to Portland, on Aug. 16.
None of the ships are alleged to have dumped pollution into the ocean off the coast of Maine.

William Barr is asking questions the media doesn't want asked

Texto completo: “I’m amused,” Attorney General William Barr told CBS News’ Jan Crawford, “by these people who make a living disclosing classified information, including the names of intelligence operatives, wringing their hands about whether I’m going to be responsible in protecting intelligence sources and methods.”
He went on after further questions, “Well, the media reaction is strange. Normally the media would be interested in letting the sunshine in and finding out what the truth is. And usually the media doesn’t care that much about protecting intelligence sources and methods. But I do and I will.”
You don’t have to have been “in the business” for Barr’s nearly 50 years to understand what he means. Just flash back 13 years to June 2006 and read the New York Times’ revelations about the Swift bank procedures.
The Belgian-based Swift manages foreign currency transfers, and after 9/11, the CIA and Treasury conducted data searches to spot and ultimately stop terrorist financing. The Times’ story conceded that this program was successful in obstructing terrorist activity and it identified no abuses.
Top administration officials pleaded with the Times not to publish the story, and President George W. Bush said publication was “disgraceful.” Times editor Bill Keller’s justification: “the administration’s” — not the government’s, but the administration’s — “extraordinary access to this vast repository of international financial data ... is a matter of public interest.”
In other words, the Times didn’t care much about weakening America’s fight against terrorism by disclosing classified information and revealing intelligence sources and methods. It was more interested in letting the sunshine in on a program which, to the best of its knowledge, had infringed no one’s rights.
Some called for prosecution of the Times for violating the Espionage Act of 1917, which criminalized the publication of classified information and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson two months after the U.S. entered World War I. But as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan pointed out in his 1998 book Secrecy: The American Experience, the Espionage Act is over-broad and the government tends to over-classify information, including even newspaper articles.
Accordingly, successive administrations, up to and including George W. Bush’s, have declined to prosecute news media for publishing stories, including leaks of classified information, that seem clearly forbidden by the words of Woodrow Wilson’s Espionage Act.
Abandoning that precedent, perhaps surprisingly, was the administration of President Barack Obama, who described himself as “a strong believer in the First Amendment” and dismissed “stories about us cracking down on whistleblowers or whatnot” as “a really small sample.”
Actually, they were an unprecedentedly large number. James Risen, co-byliner on the Times’s original Swift story, wrote in December 2016 that the Obama administration “has prosecuted nine cases involving whistleblowers and leakers, compared with only three by all previous administrations combined.”
Obama’s Justice Department subpoenaed Associated Press phone records of AP trunk lines and 30 separate phones. It identified Fox News reporter James Rosen as a “co-conspirator” in an Espionage Act leak case. The supposedly liberal and pro-First Amendment Obama administration was actively pursuing what the Columbia Journalism Review called “a massive intrusion into newsgathering operations.”
It’s true that Obama did not emit as many tart words for the press in his eight years as president as Trump has in his two and a half. But Trump has come nowhere near to challenging Obama’s record as the president most inclined to sic law enforcement on the press since Woodrow Wilson himself. Liberal Democrats aren’t necessarily the best friends of press freedom.
Nor, it seems, are they necessarily friends of a citizen’s right of privacy or a candidate’s right to seek public office without government surveillance. In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, when Barr made the point that government “spying” had occurred on the Trump campaign, Democrats and the press expressed horror. You’re not supposed to say “spying,” apparently, even though Democrats and media such as the Times have routinely used that word as a conveniently short and understandable synonym for government surveillance.
As Barr told Crawford, spying is appropriate if it’s “adequately predicated,” and it’s unclear whether the spying on the Trump campaign was. Certainly, the contents of the partisan and unverified Steele dossier would not have provided legitimate grounds on their own.
Barr is old enough to remember when liberals did not take government legal or intelligence agencies’ word that spying on an administration’s opponents was justified, when they did not attack those who questioned it as unpatriotic.
He may be amused that such doings are self-righteously justified today. But it’s good that he’s willing to ask questions most of the media doesn't want asked, to determine how the Obama law enforcement and intelligence agencies set about spying on the opposite party’s presidential campaign.

NYT reporter: Sources say Christopher Steele worried DOJ inspector general will 'throw him under the bus'

Texto completo: Trump dossier author Christopher Steele is seemingly deeply worried about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation being carried out by the Justice Department inspector general.

Matthew Rosenberg, a correspondent for the New York Times and CNN national security analyst, said he has spoken with people in Steele's orbit who confirmed the British ex-spy is willing to meet with “investigators close to the inspector general investigation." But Steele is also “incredibly concerned and obsessed that this investigation is going to throw him under the bus," Rosenberg said Tuesday on CNN.
This week a report from the Times in the United Kingdom said Steele is willing to meet with U.S. officials, but only to discuss his work for the FBI as a confidential source, and wants the United States to get permission from the U.K. government first. The report came out as President Trump was in the country for a state visit.

Quoting sources close to Steele, Rosenberg framed Steele’s thinking as, "‘Look, I was working on this dossier other people were paying for — that the Democrats were paying for. I saw things that seemed frightening to me and alarming. And I went to old contacts at the FBI to tell them. I wasn’t a paid source in this case.’ That’s his view of it.”
Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
Rosenberg said Steele does not think he should be blamed for any actions of the FBI or DOJ and “he was simply helping them out and what they did with it, whether they misused it in a FISA or whatever they did, he had nothing to do with that.”
Rosenberg agreed with this assessment, saying Steele wasn’t part of the FISA process, but was “simply a source of information.”
Steele worked to provide information from his dossier to over a dozen journalists and media organizations. Steele also used various government contacts — like top DOJ official Bruce Ohr, State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, and others — in his efforts to get the dossier into the hands of U.S. officials and have it taken seriously.
“[Steele] is acutely concerned that he’s going to be thrown under the bus here,” Rosenberg noted.
Earlier this year Attorney General William Barr said he expected Horowitz’s investigation to be wrapped up by the end of May or June. Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, so if Horowitz does soon speak with Steele it is unclear what that will mean for the inquiry that was thought to be winding down if not complete.
Barr also is taking a broader look into the origins of the Russia investigation and picked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review.

Texto completo: YouTube anunció este miércoles planes para eliminar miles de videos y canales que promueven el neonazismo, la supremacía blanca y otras ideologías intolerantes en un intento por limpiar el extremismo y el discurso de odio.
“Los videos que alegan que un grupo es superior para justificar la discriminación, la segregación o la exclusión (serán prohibidos)” , dijo la compañía en un comunicado.
La prohibición también borrará aquellas teorías de conspiración que afirmen que no ocurrieron hechos como el tiroteo en masa en la Escuela Primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut.
“Es nuestra responsabilidad proteger eso y evitar que nuestra plataforma se use para incitar al odio, el hostigamiento, la discriminación y la violencia” , dijo la compañía en información primero reportada por The New York Times.
La decisión de YouTube, que es propiedad de Google, se suma las acciones de Facebook para rechazar mensajes de ese tipo y vetó a a siete de sus usuarios más controvertidos, incluido Alex Jones , el teórico de la conspiración y fundador de InfoWars, quien también fue vetado en Twitter.
El presidente Donald Trump ha defendido a quienes publican mensajes que abonan a la discriminación, asegurando que las compañías tecnológicas han sido injustas y apoyan a los izquierdistas.
Incluso la Casa Blanca tiene una iniciativa para evitar que eso siga ocurriendo, pero algunas redes sociales y plataformas avanzan en el desecho de mensajes, fotos, videos y otros productos que inciten al odio y cualquier tipo de discriminación.
La comunidad hispana ha sido una de las más afectadas por el incremento de estos grupos de odio, incluso una de esas organizaciones, “Identity Evropa” , organizó una protesta en el Consulado de México en Nueva York en contra de los inmigrantes el 30 de julio de 2018.

Texto completo: En el Congreso avanzan las voces en contra la decisión del presidente Donald Trump de imponer aranceles del 5% al 25% a productos mexicanos, al grado que senadores advirtieron que se oponían a sus planes.
Esto luego de que el presidente Trump afirmara desde Inglaterra –donde fue a visita de Estado– que los representantes serían “unos tontos” si intentaran bloquear la medida contra México, a partir del 10 de junio.
Aunque defienden la seguridad en la frontera –la principal razón por la que el mandatario impone las tarifas– rechazan que los impuestos se conviertan en una medida de presión, porque afectaría a productores estadounidenses.
El respaldo incluso llegó de senadores que abiertamente defienden al mandatario en casi todas sus medidas, como Ted Cruz , de Texas, reportó The New York Times.
“No me rendiré a nadie con pasión, seriedad y compromiso para asegurar la frontera” , dijo Cruz. “Pero no hay ninguna razón para que los granjeros, ganaderos, fabricantes y pequeñas empresas de Texas paguen el precio de nuevos impuestos masivos” .
Para otro republicano de Texas, John Cornyn , la medida del mandatario es como un suicidio comercial.
“Estamos apuntando un arma a nuestras propias cabezas” , expresó.
La determinación del presidente Trump incluso causó la reacción del titular de la Reserva Federal, Jerome H. Powell , quien insinuó que el Banco Central podría reducir las tasas de interés si la guerra comercial comenzara a dañar la economía.
Los 10 estados que podrían ser más afectados por esta “guerra” serían Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas, Michigan, Rhode Island, Missouri, Nebraska, Dakota del Sur, Iowa y Utah.
En Washington, D.C. hay una delegación mexicana, liderada por el canciller Marcelo Ebrard , para reunirse con su contraparte estadounidense, liderada por el vicepresidente Mike Pence y el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo .

Texto completo: As Massachusetts continues to open marijuana stores, the government should do more to mitigate health risks associated with increased availability of the drug, a group of public health advocates said Wednesday.
Speaking at an event held by the Massachusetts Prevention Alliance, a nonprofit that opposed legalization, researchers and advocates suggested a number of policy changes, including requiring product labels that warn of marijuana's potential to increase consumers' risk for severe mental illness; restricting cannabis companies from advertising on billboards and in other ways; and increasing public awareness about marijuana's risks.
“We need to contain the damage," said Dr. Eden Evins, director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Addiction Medicine and a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Cannabis use, she said, “is one of the few preventable causes of psychosis."
The event at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum included former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, whose book, “Tell Your Children," warns that marijuana leads to psychosis and violence.
Berenson praised Canada's labeling requirements for cannabis products that warn of an increased risk for psychosis and schizophrenia.
“We're not at 100 percent certainty, but we're pretty close," Berenson said. “We should be telling people this and we should be telling them loudly."
Massachusetts' labels warn against intoxicated driving and pregnant women consuming the drug, and note that “there may be associated health risks."
Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said it's hard to combat the public perception that marijuana is harmless because its consequences are less visible.
“Yes, tobacco is more harmful for cancer, but marijuana is more harmful as it disrupts who you are as a person," she said. “We have 480,000 people dying from tobacco and none have died from marijuana, but it's a distorted argument because marijuana harms your humanity, your brain."
Will Jones, with the national antilegalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said the government should do more to protect black neighborhoods, which are already targeted by tobacco and alcohol advertising.
“We can create a better future than replicating what we've done with alcohol," said Jones, who is black and lives in Washington, D.C. “Advertisements and promotion of a new addiction-for-profit industry — that is another extreme that will disproportionately impact our communities."
The Massachusetts Prevention Alliance released a statement last week signed by 40 doctors and researchers who called for the state's cannabis regulations to focus more on public health. In response, regulators noted that the state was already doing a lot of the requested actions — such as launching public awareness campaigns and banning cartoon imagery that could appeal to youths — and said the statement badly mischaracterized the state's social equity program.
The nonprofit has also drawn fire from marijuana advocates who say it doesn't seriously engage in policy-making.
“This group was nowhere to be found when we wrote the adult use" regulations, Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commissioner Shaleen Title tweeted this week.
Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital who specializes in cannabis and teaches at Harvard Medical School, criticized the event as one-sided. The participants' arguments, he said, overstated the harms of cannabis and ignored the benefits patients have found in treating pain, insomnia, and other life-altering conditions.
The group's stance “is not representative of what doctors think," Grinspoon said. “This is in the realm of drug war ideology — not the realm of science-based discussion."
Berenson's book has made him a controversial figure in the marijuana debate. Critics say he exaggerates the harms of cannabis, which muddies efforts to educate the public.
Scientists widely accept that marijuana use is correlated with chronic mental illness, specifically schizophrenia, but they disagree about causality.
Berenson's assertion was based in part on a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine study in 2017 that found that “cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the greater the risk."
One of the study authors, however, rebutted Berenson's characterization on Twitter in January, saying that her team only “found an association between cannabis use and schizophrenia."
“Since the report, we now know that genetic risk for schizophrenia predicts cannabis use, shedding some light on the potential direction of the association between cannabis use and schizophrenia," wrote Ziva Cooper, director of the Cannabis Research Initiative at the University of California Los Angeles.
In a study published in March in Lancet Psychiatry, researchers examining 17 sites across Europe found that daily cannabis use and high-potency cannabis use were correlated with psychosis. While just 7 percent of the control group of healthy people used cannabis daily, 30 percent of people experiencing first-time psychosis did. The authors acknowledged they established correlation, not causation, but said the findings were significant for public health.
Dr. David Nathan, founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation and a psychiatrist in Princeton, N.J., said that people with family or personal histories of psychotic disorders should stay away from cannabis, but the vast majority of consumers don't experience such issues.
“What we cannot say is whether cannabis will cause psychosis in individuals who are not otherwise predisposed to it," Nathan said. “The problem with Berenson's book is that he goes far beyond what the evidence tells us."
Berenson said the torrent of criticism has been baffling.
“My book has been criticized as racist, alarmist, confusing correlation and causation, and cherrypicking," Berenson said. “To me these aren't just lies, they're stunningly stupid lies."

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE HANDMAID'S TALE Stream on Hulu. After a twist-filled Season 2 finale left audiences discordant (or just asking why June didn't get into that truck), "The Handmaid's Tale" returns to Hulu for a third round. Continuing its interpretation of the novel by Margaret Atwood, the acclaimed series will bring back Elisabeth Moss as June, whose tale of resistance in a New England reshaped by environmental catastrophe and a patriarchal, totalitarian state has inspired intense fandom and real-world activism. Season 2 saw Serena Joy Waterford, the complicated and often staggeringly evil character played by Yvonne Strahovski, getting more attention -- a trend that continues. "These super powerhouse female roles are layered and complex, and the story lines are amazing," Strahovski recently told The New York Times, "and it's so fun as an actor to come to work and play with that."
BLACK MIRROR Stream on Netflix. Charlie Brooker's anthology series raises one eyebrow at technology and its other at human nature. The three unconnected episodes that make up the show's fifth season, all debuting Wednesday, each run over an hour. Some discussion is bound to be centered on the season's most famous cast member, Miley Cyrus, who plays a pop star in trouble in an episode called "Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too." Another episode, "Striking Vipers," imagines a fictional virtual reality video game that adds a new dimension to a friendship in more ways than one. And "Smithereens" centers on a rideshare-enabled kidnapping that also brings up questions about the power of social media companies and offbeat tech executives.
What's on TV
GODZILLA (2014) 5:30 p.m. on TNT. Godzilla's stature may have been cut down slightly by last weekend's release of "Godzilla: King of the Monsters," which was met with disappointing sales at the box office. But there's no denying this monster's staying power in the popular imagination. The new movie is a sequel to this 2014 effort, which gave the classic city kicker a new coat of paint through modern-day visual effects. It's good for a night in; the kind of movie during which you can safely get up to answer the door for pizza. It is "at once bloated and efficient, executed with tremendous discipline and intelligence and conceived with not too much of either," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. Gareth Edwards, who went on to direct "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," directed this reboot.
NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH LESTER HOLT 6:30 p.m. on NBC. Tonight's episode of this NBC News program will be broadcast from Normandy, with a program dedicated to the 75th anniversary of D-Day. It includes interviews with two American D-Day veterans and a visit to the Airborne Museum in Ste.-Mère-Église.
2019 CMT MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on CMT. The country harmonizers Little Big Town will host this year's CMT Music Awards in Nashville. Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood, Sheryl Crow, Brandi Carlile, Tanya Tucker, Luke Bryan, Toby Keith and Zac Brown Band are among the show's performers.

Georgia's Abrams urges Hollywood to forgo boycott

Texto completo: Democrat calls on studios to back groups challenging abortion law
Stacey Abrams, the Democrat from Georgia who earned national attention after narrowly losing her bid for governor last year, is urging Hollywood not to abandon the state over its new and more restrictive abortion law.
Some of the biggest names in film and television - including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia - have suggested they might boycott Georgia if the legislation survives court challenges. But Abrams, political allies and business leaders contend an economic boycott would only serve to deprive working-class people of jobs with no guarantee it would reverse a law that is being teed up to challenge Roe v. Wade .
Instead, they are mobilizing a "#StayAndFight" coalition intent on encouraging Hollywood power brokers to put their financial heft behind political candidates and groups challenging the law.
Abrams and the head of an abortion rights group will huddle with film industry leaders June 11 in Los Angeles, an Abrams spokesman confirmed Tuesday to The Washington Post. The meeting, which was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, will focus on the potential health care and economic consequences the law might create.
Film industry workers also are organizing against a potential boycott, forming #StayAndFightGeorgia and raising money for the American Civil Liberties Union's legal challenge to the abortion law.
The Georgia law, signed last month by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, prohibits abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs near the six-week mark and before many women know they are pregnant. More than a dozen states have adopted or are moving toward similar limits in efforts to challenge Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
The new abortion law sparked a backlash among the Hollywood studios that helped make filmmaking a $9.5 billion industry in the state, creating more than 90,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study. Last week, Netflix - which films "Stranger Things," "Insatiable" and "Ozark" there - was the first major studio to announce it might have to "rethink" its business there if the restrictions take hold. Disney, which shot the box office heavyweights, "Avengers: Endgame" and "Black Panther" in the state, quickly followed suit.
Smaller companies, including those run by actor-directors Mark and Jay Duplass, and "Wire" writer David Simon, as well as dozens of actors - including Alyssa Milano, Gabrielle Union, Mia Farrow, Don Cheadle and Patton Oswalt - are also on board with a possible boycott.
On Monday, AMC Networks said it, too, would "reevaluate" its activity in Georgia. The company films its hit show "The Walking Dead" in the Atlanta area. "Similar bills - some even more restrictive - have passed in multiple states and have been challenged. This is likely to be a long and complicated fight, and we are watching it all very closely," the company said in a statement.
The industry pushback also has garnered attention on the 2020 campaign trail. During a CNN town hall Sunday, presidential hopeful Rep. Eric Swalwell said he would support a boycott. Then the California Democrat went further and suggested CNN, which has called Georgia home for nearly four decades, might want to move its headquarters away from Atlanta over the law.
The company did not respond to a request for comment. But last week, its parent company, WarnerMedia, said that "if the new law holds we will reconsider Georgia as the home to any new productions."
As Hollywood celebrities have called on the major studios to leave the state, Abrams and her political allies have advocated a more long-term response - to use the industry's resources to support grass-roots political and legal efforts. J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele, following her lead, recently said they would continue plans to shoot their coming series "Lovecraft Country" in Georgia but would donate their respective fees to the local ACLU chapter and to a voting rights group Abrams founded.
Meanwhile, Hollywood producer and investor Peter Chernin is trying to raise $15 million to help finance a legal challenge to the abortion law in Georgia and other states, according to the New York Times. His company and foundation have already donated $1 million to the effort, the Times reported, and he has reached out to senior executives at all the major movie studios, as well as to such names as Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Shonda Rhimes. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
"We have a moral responsibility to act immediately," he wrote in an email about the initiative that was forwarded to the Times.
The controversy over Georgia's new restrictions on abortion is playing out over a broader battle for political control of the state legislature. Provoked by the successful passage of the "heartbeat bill," Democrats in the state launched a new group Tuesday to target vulnerable Republican incumbents and flip the Georgia House in the 2020 election.

'My aim was in no way to endorse the president': Pastor explains why he prayed for Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When David Platt concluded his sermon Sunday during an afternoon service at McLean Bible Church in suburban Virginia, he thought he would have a few minutes to himself for quiet reflection.
Instead, he was whisked backstage and given a message: "the president of the United States was on his way to the church, would be there in a matter of minutes, and would like for us to pray for him."
Unlike other pastors who have fiercely supported President Trump, Platt, known for his nonpartisan approach to preaching, found himself facing a tough decision.
After ultimately choosing to bring Trump onstage and fulfill the president's request, Platt felt he owed his congregation a lengthy explanation for his reasoning, even acknowledging that "some within our church . . . are hurt that I made this decision."
In a detailed letter posted on the nondenominational megachurch's website Sunday evening and shared by Platt to social media on Monday, the pastor wrote, "My aim was in no way to endorse the president, his policies, or his party, but to obey God's command to pray for our president and other leaders . . ."
The letter, which was addressed to Platt's "church family," comes at a time when evangelicals across the nation are becoming increasingly divided over supporting a president whose personal actions and policies, some critics say, fail to align with Christianity's core beliefs.
Platt, who has been a pastor at McLean Bible Church for two years, is best known for authoring the New York Times best-selling book, "Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream," in which he calls out materialism.
On Sunday, Trump caught Platt, churchgoers, and reporters by surprise when he made the unscheduled 15-minute stop on his way back to the White House after spending the morning at Trump National Golf Course in Sterling, Va.

Trump firm faces tax evasion allegations in Panama
NEW YORK — The majority owner of a former Trump-branded hotel in Panama alleged in a court filing on Monday that the president's company misrepresented finances of the building to evade taxes in the country. A filing in New York federal court by property owner Orestes Fintiklis alleges that President Trump's hotel management firm evaded income and Social Security taxes when it managed the former Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower. The new accusations are part of a bitter dispute between Trump's company and Fintiklis, the majority owner of the 70-story, seaside, sail-shaped building.
The filing said Trump's company misrepresented salaries paid to employees and other financial records to cut its tax bill on fees it was collecting for managing the hotel, slash its Social Security payments and hand over less to owner Fintiklis. The Trump Organization said that it did not evade any taxes and, if anything, Fintiklis is to blame on tax matters.
The dispute started in October 2017 after Fintiklis' company, Ithaca Capital Group, took control of 202 of the hotel's condos. Fintiklis then pushed to terminate Trump's 20-year contract managing the building, alleging "gross negligence and potentially fraudulent conduct," including "looted" bank accounts.

New ICE chief looking to increase family deportations
WASHINGTON — The new top immigration official signaled Tuesday his agency is looking to step up deportations of families who are in the United States illegally, actions that would likely run into logistical hurdles and face strong public opposition.
Mark Morgan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency would continue to prioritize deportations of people who have criminal histories, but that no one should be exempt from enforcement. "That will include families," he said to ICE officials and reporters.

Texto completo: "If you're not paying for a product, chances are you have become what's being sold."
The pithy saying surfaced in the 1990s as a way of letting online users know that companies were making money off them, regardless of whether the user punched in their credit card or bank number.
Websites, apps and other digital producers have ways of collecting data about users that they can use to sell to advertisers and other like-minded companies.
At this point, it is a part of the online economy. (Full disclosure: Media companies, including this one, collect basic information about our website's visitors for advertising purposes.)
The practice of stealth data collection and unwarranted dissemination has gone unregulated for too long. And many digital media companies are proving they cannot be trusted to be self-regulate their use of this data.
Consumers deserve to know what information is being collected about them, who is collecting it and in what ways it will be disseminated to third parties.
Too often, consumer information is ending up in the far reaches of the internet and in the hands of bad actors.
Last year, The New York Times and other media companies reported British political firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal information of millions of Facebook users without their consent to build voter profiles for the Trump presidential campaign.
In April, Facebook revealed it has set aside $3 billion as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission following concerns the media platform failed to provide clear and prominent notice - and receive consent - to share data with other companies. That figure could increase to as much as $5 billion, according to media reports.
Yes, $3 billion is a significant sum, but the FTC's action is responsive to Facebook's misdeeds rather than the agency being a proactive player in policing.
Other apps cellphone users download to track a user's progress as they battle depression or attempt to quit smoking are sharing the personal details they collect with third parties, like Google and Facebook, without consent, according to a study published by the journal JAMA Network Open.
Many apps aren't regulated by the government, meaning users who type data into a service expecting to receive help or track progress are unknowingly allowing their data to be accessed by myriad other companies.
Many smartwatches that track your heartbeat and other vital information are also collecting data that can end up in the hands of health and insurance companies without your permission or knowledge.
A Wall Street Journal analysis found Facebook installed analytics software inside thousands of health apps, so sensitive information - such as ovulation, menstrual cycles and blood pressure - could be collected and stored by the media platform.
The data is then available to Facebook users and developers, making it easier for agencies to create targeted ads towards the users of those apps.
The companies running the apps have no ability to remove or disable Facebook's software, and none of the apps gave users the option to stop their personal information from being sent to Facebook.
The FTC must investigate Facebook's practices because they are an egregious violation of privacy.
Lawmakers in Europe are leading in this swamp of data collection, although their path may not be one the U.S. wants to replicate.
Nearly a year ago, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect to better regulate the collection, use and retention of data by digital companies.
The pop-up privacy notifications are the regulations' most recognizable features, giving users the ability to take action of what information they share.
The European regulations have not lived up to all of the promises officials made prior to the legislation's passage. But the rules are a good first step, and they must be adjusted over time to ensure users are protected and companies pay for overstepping their bounds.
Canada is also considering proposals to better regulate the transfer and dissemination of data.
North American countries can learn from the successes and failures of the GDPR's rollout to better craft policies that are amenable to digital users here.
Ultimately, consumers must feel as though they are in control of the data being collected about them, regardless of whether it is their heartbeat or a list of the websites they have visited.
Consent and clarity would help alleviate these concerns and create a more transparent world of online commerce that many of us enjoy.

FLAWED PROCESS MUELLER'S PUBLIC REMARKS OFFERED NO CLARITY

Texto completo: Republicans insist that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation cleared President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, while Democrats maintain the opposite.
If Americans are confused, little wonder. Mr. Mueller is a good public servant, but the process he followed was awful. His 10-minute news conference last week provided no clarity for the public but gave the party partisans more grist for their PR machines.
Should there be future need for a special counsel on any federal matter, the investigation must be conducted in a reasonable time frame that everyone knows in advance. Just as important, the American public must be told up front what the limitations and possible outcomes will be.
The public waited two years for the former FBI director to issue a report on his investigation into whether Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. That was too long a wait, especially when much of the government's energy and attention during this period were consumed by investigation-watching and the related parlor game of speculating on the outcome.
Mr. Mueller's report, issued in April, concluded that there was no collusion.
The report also addressed the question of whether Mr. Trump obstructed the investigation. For example, Mr. Trump suggested that FBI Director James Comey let National Security Adviser Michael Flynn off the hook after he had been caught lying about his Russian contacts. He ultimately fired Mr. Comey after saying he was displeased with how he handled questions about Russian interference in the election and urged subordinates to fire Mr. Mueller as well.
While Mr. Trump said and did things that looked bad - in some cases perhaps because he didn't understand the limits of his authority or how the Justice Department operated - the report noted that people inside the president's inner circle, such as former White House Counsel Don McGahn, failed to follow through on orders that would have derailed the investigation. In the end, Mr. Mueller's report neither accused the president of obstruction nor exonerated him.
That was enough for Trump partisans to spin the story one way and the president's haters to spin it another.
Only late in the process did much of the public come to understand that Mr. Mueller wouldn't have filed a charge even if the evidence warranted one. The reason: a Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president. That left many people - those without skin in the game -wondering about the point of the whole exercise.
The public expected a "yes, he did wrong," or "no, he didn't" and the lack of clarity was unsettling to all but the partisan spinmeisters. It's highly unusual for the federal government ever to comment on matters that don't result in charges. The reason is to spare the reputation of a person never formally accused.
Breaking two years of silence, Mr. Mueller decided to say a few words as he wrapped up his work. His lawyerly dissection of the report - "if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so" - provided no additional clarity, just more words for the partisan hacks to mine to their advantage.
Mr. Mueller was right when he said the report really should speak for itself. But the report would have meant more if the parameters and limits of the investigation were spelled out clearly in the beginning.

Charles Demuth's flower watercolors on display in ''Focus on Flora'

Texto completo: Charles Demuth loved flowers.
Living in his home on East King Street, which is now the Demuth Museum, the artist had the perfect view of mother Augusta’s garden.
That garden, which in the early 20th century ran all the way to Mifflin Street, was a lifelong inspiration for the artist.
Throughout his 51 years, Demuth always returned to flowers, usually done in watercolor.
The Demuth Museum is now exhibiting “Focus on Flora,” featuring 10 Demuth watercolors; a childhood sketchbook; a painting by his aunt, Louisa Demuth, who inspired her young nephew; and a painting on porcelain.
“We tried to show works from a variety of different periods,” says Abigail Baer, the director of the Demuth Museum and the Lancaster Museum of Art. “The childhood sketchbook has never been displayed before. The peonies he did as a child; I’m guessing he was 9 or 10. There are several from early adulthood, and then some pieces from just before his death.”
While some of his most famous precisionist pieces are in oil, watercolor was his primary medium for flowers.
His work is masterful.
As New York Times art critic Ken Johnson wrote in 2008:
“Search the history of American art, and you will discover few watercolors more beautiful than those of Charles Demuth. Combining exacting botanical observation and loosely Cubist abstraction, his watercolors of flowers, fruit and vegetables have a magical liveliness and an almost shocking sensuousness.”
The works are fragile, so the lighting is dimmed in the museum, Baer notes.
While The Demuth Museum has the largest collection of Demuth works in the world — more than 50 pieces — two of the pieces are on loan.
“Tulips” (1917) is from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and “Lavender Morning Glories” (no date) is on loan from the Reading Public Museum.
The “Tulips” loan is part of a statewide art sharing initiative. The Demuth Museum is one of eight museums partnering with the Philadelphia Museum of Art to share pieces from the art museum’s massive collection.
It’s part of a grant from Art Bridges and the Terra Foundation of American Art.
“This is phase one,” Baer says. “We are hoping for phase two, with an exhibition in 2020. Works normally in storage can come out into galleries throughout the state.”
------------
Contrasting pieces
“Tulips” is an interesting counterpoint to Demuth’s “Pink Tulips” (1930), which Baer says is “kind of the crown jewel of our collection.”
“Pink Tulips” is bright, and the blooms look hale and hearty.
“The tulips are in a different phase of their life cycle,” Baer says. “The tulips in the Philadelphia collection piece are faded, the petals about to drop.”
To the uninitiated, “Lavender Morning Glories,” from the Reading Public Museum might look unfinished. But Demuth experimented with keeping much of the paper white and not concealing the graphite marks in his work. Often, the flowers floated on the paper.
One of the paintings is from Demuth’s aunt, Louisa, who Baer says encouraged young Charles to paint.
The flowers in this exhibit are all spring flowers — tulips, daffodils and irises. Demuth certainly painted summer flowers, like zinnias; they just are not part of the exhibit.
------------
Garden tour
The exhibit coincides with the Demuth Garden Tour, being held Saturday and Sunday.
Tickets are $18 in advance and $20 the day of the tour. They can be purchased at the museum, over the phone at 717-299-9940 or at demuth.org.
“The tour features 12 gardens this year,” Baer says. “The Demuth Museum and the Conestoga House are among the 12, and there are a grouping of gardens in the Lititz and Leola areas, including the Lititz Historical Foundation. And a city pocket garden will be included as well.”
You can begin the tour at the Demuth Museum, where you can see a part of the garden that inspired Demuth, where the peonies and roses are having their day, while the spring flowers from the exhibit have faded until next year.
The museum is hoping to make Demuth’s work more visible.
“We are working to focus one gallery on the first floor featuring works from the collection,” Baer says.
The exhibit space will be permanent, but the work will be rotated.
“We want to tell Demuth’s story.”

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani was doing Donald Trump's dirty work long before he became president.
In early 1997, then-Mayor Giuliani dispatched city enforcers to tear down a homeless encampment on the Upper West Side where Trump was about to build a luxury apartment complex - and a fact-challenged letter obtained by the Daily News shows the boisterous real estate baron appreciated the razing.
Trump, then a high-rolling developer fresh off failed business ventures in New York and New Jersey, issued the March 4, 1997, letter as a token of thanks to Giuliani for sending the now-defunct Community Assistance Unit to remove dozens of homeless people and demolish the encampment they'd built on W. 66th St. near Riverside Blvd.
Within days of the abrupt eviction, the Trump Organization broke ground on its tony 18-building Riverside South complex across the railroad tracks from the encampment.
The previously unreported letter - at the top of which Trump had scratched out "Dear Mayor Giuliani"and jotted "RUDY" instead - said "a number of serious crimes" had been attributed to "these people" and that the nearby ABC studios had "suffered serious infestation problems" because of the encampment.
Trump also praised Giuliani for spearheading the "humane removal" of the homeless people.
"The operation was completed ... and was deemed by all to be highly successful," Trump wrote.
Homeless advocates - and even Giuliani himself - questioned Trump's claims.
"I don't remember that one as being particularly violent," Giuliani told The News last week after being shown the letter, adding the encampment wasn't "bad."
"But," Giuliani added, "by reducing the homeless situation I made the city much safer for all, including them."
Mary Brosnahan, a former executive director at the Coalition for the Homeless, knocked both Trump and Giuliani and called the letter a "sham."
"They didn't relocate anyone. It was Giuliani's MO to just push people out of view," Brosnahan, whose group vehemently opposed the encampment removal, said in an interview. "People were being forced out and Trump's essentially telling Giuliani, 'We don't want them back.' "
Brosnahan said her organization petitioned the federal government and made sure some of the people booted from the encampment got Section 8 housing vouchers.
"If anything humanely happened it was despite [the Community Assistance Unit], not because of them," Brosnahan said.
Trump's rosy depiction of the unit's eviction job is also contradicted by "Fragile Dwelling," a 2000 book by photographer and writer Margaret Morton, who documented the encampment extensively.
"City police forced the residents to leave on Feb. 25, 1997," Morton wrote. "Within hours, bulldozers had buried their homes with dirt and debris excavated from a construction site directly across the tracks, where a complex of luxury apartment towers was soon to rise."
It's not clear if Trump had personally asked Giuliani for the encampment gutting. Spokesmen for the Trump Organization and the White House did not return requests for comment.
Giuliani, now best known for serving as Trump's media attack dog and personal lawyer, said he "couldn't possibly remember" whether Trump or his company had requested the eviction.
However, a New York Times report from the time said City Hall "moved up" the eviction specifically because Trump had planned to start construction that week.
Like Giuliani, Brosnahan questioned Trump's claim that there was widespread crime at the encampment and scoffed at the idea that employees at the nearby ABC studios felt threatened.
"One of our main partners and advocates for that encampment was Peter Jennings," Brosnahan said of the late ABC News anchor.
Spokesmen for ABC did not return requests for comment.
Brosnahan said she still considers the encampment bulldozing as devastating.
"I don't want to glamorize it, but people had built duplexes, had pets, TVs and art that was destroyed," she said. "There was a real sense of community and respect among them."

Texto completo: Senator Elizabeth Warren has climbed in recent polls as she churns out a stream of ambitious policy proposals and renews calls for President Trump's impeachment.
In public remarks, Ms. Warren weaves personal anecdotes with explanations of her many plans, interspersing statistics and critiques of wealth inequality and corruption in Washington. Her focus on her own past and broad outlines for the future have helped her avoid making factual inaccuracies, though she has, on occasion, slightly overstated both.
Her proposed wealth tax
What Ms. Warren Said
"If we put that 2-cent wealth tax in place on the 75,000 largest fortunes in this country, 2 cents, we can do universal child care for every baby 0 to 5, universal pre-K, universal college and knock back the student loan debt burden for 95 percent of our students and still have nearly a trillion dollars left over."
-- CNN town-hall-style meeting in April
Maybe.
Ms. Warren's plan imposes a 2 percent annual tax on fortunes over $ 50 million, with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth over $ 1 billion. This would generate about $ 2.75 trillion over 10 years, estimated Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two respected economists at the University of California, Berkeley.
Analysts asked by Ms. Warren to evaluate her proposals estimated that universal child care would cost $ 707 billion over a decade and student debt forgiveness $ 640 billion. A campaign spokesman said her college plan also included $ 100 billion in additional Pell grants, $ 50 billion for historically black colleges and universities and $ 470 billion over 10 years for the federal government to pay two-thirds of the cost of free college tuition. That's a total cost of just under $ 2 trillion, with $ 783 billion left unspent.
But any number of factors could throw Ms. Warren's plan off course and into the red.
"The challenge is twofold: Measuring behavioral responses to the tax and accurately calculating the value of privately held businesses that account for much of the wealth of the very rich," said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
For example, multimillionaires and billionaires could conceivably give away some of their wealth before the tax lands on them, said Marc Goldwein, the senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
A separate analysis of Ms. Warren's wealth tax found that it would generate just 40 percent of the revenue estimated by Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman. The analysis, by Lawrence H. Summers, a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, and Natasha Sarin, a law and finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, contends that the two Berkeley economists underestimated the ways rich people could seek to minimize or avoid paying the tax.
Mr. Gleckman said that the Tax Policy Center had not yet completed its own analysis of Ms. Warren's tax, but that he believed the estimate by Mr. Summers and Ms. Sarin was "closer to the mark" than the $ 2.75 trillion figure.
Mr. Goldwein agreed that Ms. Warren's plan could potentially fall short of expected revenue targets, but praised her campaign for providing details on funding sources and noted that the tax could always be adjusted to make up for any deficits.
The other side of the ledger could be off as well. For example, the $ 707 billion figure for universal child care factors in economic growth generated by the plan, but under "static" scoring -- without assuming any changes in growth -- the cost is closer to $ 1.1 trillion. Similarly, the $ 470 billion estimate for free college tuition assumes that states would be willing to contribute the remaining one-third that the federal government does not fund.
What Ms. Warren Said
"My 2-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the fortunes in this country, if we use just a piece of that money to forgive student loan debt for about 95 percent of those who have student loan debt, that has huge support among Democrats, independents and Republicans."
-- Fairfax, Va., in May
True.
Several polls have found that Ms. Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, though "huge" is a slight overstatement.
Of the respondents, 61 percent supported the proposal in a January survey commissioned by Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank. More Republicans supported the wealth tax than opposed it, 44 percent to 37 percent, while 61 percent of independents and 76 percent of Democrats also endorsed it.
In a Morning Consult/Politico poll in February, 61 percent of all respondents were in favor of the wealth tax, including 74 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans.
Polling that month from Survey Monkey for The New York Times produced similar results: 61 percent approval among all respondents, 75 percent among Democrats, 57 percent among independents and 51 percent among Republicans.
An April poll from Quinnipiac University found similar or higher levels of support among all respondents (60 percent), Democrats (82 percent) and independents (63 percent) but notably lower approval from Republicans (32 percent in support and 60 percent in opposition).
Past stance on pot
What Ms. Warren Said
"So, actually, I supported Massachusetts changing its laws on marijuana. Massachusetts had decriminalized at that point and I thought it made a lot more sense for Massachusetts to go ahead and legalize marijuana, and I now support the legalization of marijuana."
-- CNN town-hall-style meeting in April
This is exaggerated.
When a student asked about her evolving position on marijuana legalization, Ms. Warren overstated her past support.
Massachusetts decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2008. But Ms. Warren, who first ran for the Senate in 2012, vacillated on a ballot initiative to legalize medical marijuana and opposed legalization in general.
"No, I don't think it should be legalized," she said in a Senate Democratic primary debate in October 2011. "Medical marijuana is one thing, but not generally, no."
In April 2012, Ms. Warren then declined to take a position on the ballot initiative, before supporting legalized medical use in a radio interview that September. The measure ultimately passed.
A few years later, Massachusetts considered another ballot initiative to approve recreational use. Asked in 2015 about her previous opposition to legalization, Ms. Warren did not deny the premise of the question and said she was "open" to it after learning from other states that had done so. A year later, she repeated that stance, saying she was receptive, but deflected when asked whether she would vote yes on the initiative.
Activists told Marijuana Moment, a website that reports on cannabis-related news, that Ms. Warren never formally endorsed that initiative. But they said that they appreciated her evolution on the issue and leadership on the topic in Congress.
The declining value of the minimum wage
What Ms. Warren Said
"When I was a girl, a full-time minimum-wage job in America would support a family of three. It would put food on the table, pay the utilities and cover a mortgage. Today a full-time minimum-wage job in America will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty."
-- Fairfax, Va., in May
True.
Ms. Warren often cites this statistic after recounting a story about her mother, who at 50 years old got a minimum-wage job at Sears after her father had a heart attack.
That year was most likely 1961 or 1962 -- Ms. Warren's mother was born in 1912 -- when the minimum wage was $ 1.15 (about $ 9.80 today) for an annual paycheck of $ 2,392, assuming a 40-hour workweek. That would have been just above the official poverty line for a female-led, three-person household in 1961 or 1962 ( $ 2,164 and $ 2,167).
In the early 1960s, median mortgage payments ranged from $ 98 to $ 106 per month on average, while food costs for minimum-wage workers ranged from $ 600 to $ 800 per year and utilities another $ 120 to $ 170, according to data compiled by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a total annual cost of just under $ 1,900 to about $ 2,200.
Today, a federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 equates to annual earnings of about $ 15,080, assuming a 40-hour workweek. That's well below the federal poverty line for a three-person household of $ 20,212.

Texto completo: OAKLAND >> Oakland could become the second city in the nation to allow the use of psilocybin mushrooms also known as "magic mushrooms" following in Denver's footsteps.
The City Council on Tuesday will consider approving a resolution barring police from enforcing laws banning the use of "entheogenic" or psychoactive plants, which include psilocybin mushrooms, ayahuasca and peyote.
The proposed resolution stems from a movement at the state level to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms, which suffered a setback when a measure to accomplish that goal didn't make it to California's 2018 ballot. Activists are gathering signatures now to put a measure on the Oregon state ballot next year to legalize the medical use of psilocybin.
Three of the four council members who make up Oakland's public safety committee voted Tuesday to move the resolution to the full council for a vote. Supporters of the effort packed City Hall, and around 60 people many of them psychiatrists testified to the benefits of entheogenic plants.
"I've seen firsthand how these plants can heal individuals, and I really want to emphasize that these plants can also heal a community," said Gary Kono, a retired surgeon who co-founded Decriminalize Nature Oakland, an activist group leading the effort to legalize entheogenic plants in the city.
Council member Noel Gallo, who brought the resolution forward, said in his proposal that allowing the use of entheogenic plants would remove them from their underground status and "empower communities to share knowledge and continue building an above-ground infrastructure around entheogens."
Oakland, he added in his proposal, "has a unique opportunity to lead by example, and guide the nationwide conversation."
The resolution would not apply to synthetic drugs such as LSD or Ecstasy.
Larry Norris of Decriminalize Nature Oakland said that the initiatives in Oregon and Denver prompted the group to push for the resolution. It started discussing the proposal in December and pitched it to Gallo earlier this year.
Several members of Decriminalize Nature Oakland told council members of personal "life-changing" experiences that resulted from using the drugs and of how other cultures have used them for centuries to be closer to nature. Little was said at the meeting of people just using them for recreation.
"Our communities have been using natural plant medicines as they are indigenous to communities of color; they've been using them for thousands of years," said Amber Senter, a local cannabis entrepreneur who also is part of Decriminalize Nature Oakland.
Council member Loren Taylor abstained from the vote Tuesday, saying although he recognizes that the drugs can benefit people in certain settings, he is concerned they also can be used unsafely and hopes to see an education effort warning people of the risks.
"It's a matter of how we deploy it and make sure it's not something that becomes a fad with our kids and potentially used in schools," Taylor said, adding he's also worried about people driving under the influence of entheogenic plants.
Oakland police officials at Tuesday's meeting didn't weigh in on the proposal, but noted there have been only 19 cases over the past five years in which they confiscated a substance believed to be psilocybin mushrooms.
Several speakers mentioned a study released by Johns Hopkins University last year that suggested psilocybin could be used to treat depression and anxiety and even help people quit smoking, according to The New York Times. Bestselling author and Berkeley resident Michael Pollan's recent book, "How to Change Your Mind," makes the case that psychedelic drugs can be effective therapy tools, especially for people trying to recover from drug addiction.
