Texto completo: It’s easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump’s well-documented and much-ballyhooed “war” on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he’s felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He’s taken action after action against this state’s best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California’s unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality. Even though Trump and his handpicked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can’t actually do it because California’s right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump’s administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don’t meet federal clean air standards – even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards. So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves “seem counterintuitive.”
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California’s many “sanctuary cities.” He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don’t do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state’s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he’s had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum’s observation that “There’s a sucker born every minute.” Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, “the only rule is that there are no rules.”
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America’s longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It’s an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he’s made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that’s upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President’s new show, “If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California…and other diseases. But that’s the state of things today in this country…We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts.”
Added Becerra, “If the arguments in the President’s tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we’re looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court.”
The trick here is to see Trump’s real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Texto completo: To a fault, President Trump values loyalty. So it isn’t surprising he demanded to know the identity of the whistleblower who exposed the Ukraine scandal. It is, however, irresponsible.
It would be just as irresponsible for House Democrats to allow the whistleblower to give up his anonymity and testify before the House Intelligence Committee, as Chairman Adam Schiff suggested last week. Whoever this person is, he or she should remain just that: an unidentified “whoever” that stays out of the spotlight.

Equally as irresponsible was the New York Times’ decision to run a report breaking down the whistleblower’s identity. The result was immediate: Two Trump sycophants took to the internet to offer a $50,000 reward for information “relating to the identity of the ‘Trump Whistleblower.’”

Whistleblower protections exist for a reason. They prevent retaliation by media and governments, which are inevitable in this hyperpartisan, fractured political era. Trump has already vilified the unidentified person’s sources, and knowing the president, his attacks are bound to become more and more personal if the whistleblower steps into the spotlight.

“You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right?” Trump asked last week. “With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.”

And just yesterday, Trump tweeted:
Tweet
Trump’s need for loyalty has clouded his judgment: The whistleblower isn’t a spy, and what he did was not treason. The unidentified person might not be under federal protection yet, but his actions certainly were, and Trump is wrong to suggest otherwise:
Tweet
Whistleblowing is by no means a perfect system, but it does offer additional accountability we might not have otherwise. Believe it or not, whistleblowing isn’t an easy task. There’s a rigorous protocol whistleblowers must follow if they want to gain federal protection, and even then, many still face “legal and professional reprisal,” Tom Mueller wrote for Politico.
If recent history is any indication — recall, the Obama administration charged eight individuals, more than any other president, under the Espionage Act — the whistleblower won’t remain anonymous for long. The Democrats could seek to bring him forward to advance their impeachment inquiry, or it could be the whistleblower has ambitions of his own. Either way, no good can come out of making the source's identity public.

Utah has claim to largest aspen clone. But maybe it's in Colorado. Maybe it doesn't matter.

Texto completo: In 1992, a pair of University of Colorado at Boulder professors found themselves baffled.
The armillaria bulbosa, aka “the humungous fungus,” had been declared the world’s largest organism. Michael Grant heard this over the radio.
“I thought, No! We can’t have that!” he recalls.
Surely, the quaking aspen, populus tremuloides, was the largest. Surely, the cloning creature was being ignored here — the single root system accounting for several trees.
Jeffry Mitton, a colleague of Grant’s also specializing in the species, most certainly agreed.
Yes, it would be hard to find a clone that covered more ground. But to be considered the “largest,” weight had to be considered, and some number of trees definitely outweighed this spongy fungus.
The two set out to prove a point.
“Not really scientific,” Mitton says. “Just to say, you know, mine’s bigger.”
They pulled up handy data on a massive clone in Utah’s Fishlake National Forest, described in 1976. The clone reportedly covered 106 acres and contained an estimated 47,000 stems.
Imagining the clone once moving across the landscape with the glaciers, the professors came to call him Pando, Latin for “I wonder.” (Yes, Pando is male.)
They wrote in the journal Nature: “An average individual aspen shoot (stem plus leaves and branches) would easily exceed 100 kg in mass while the accompanying root system would probably exceed 30 kg.”
So for Pando, they reasoned approximately 6 million kilograms — 13 million pounds.
The blue whale and giant sequoia had nothing on that, they wrote. Nor did some “humungous fungus.”
They concluded: “Quaking aspen, the most widespread tree species in North America, can now take its rightful place as an acknowledged giant among giants.”
And that was that, they figured. “A fairly light argument,” Mitton figured, one made in a few paragraphs.
“And yet, within the next two or three years, (Pando) was in about 50 different newspapers. It was on radio programs. We got sick and tired of being interviewed about it.”
Pando is still all the rage. Just see the headlines from last year. “The Most Massive Organism on Earth,” The New York Times called him. “The World’s Largest,” Forbes put it.
That title is probably wrong. The now-retired professors who popularized Pando are the first to say so.
They maintain aspen to indeed be the planet’s biggest single organism. But the biggest clone? The previous research on Pando simply made him a convenient proxy for their quick case.
So with Colorado’s forests being the most aspen-concentrated in the Lower 48, might the biggest actually be somewhere here?
It’s possible, says Paul Rogers. He’s the director of the Western Aspen Alliance, the trees’ scientific clearinghouse based at Utah State University.
“There’s never been a systemic search that I’m aware of for the largest aspen clone out there. There’s a fair chance that another one would be found at some point,” he says.
“However, it’s sort of a needle-in-the-haystack prospect. And we just don’t have a great mechanism, we don’t know where to look, and it would probably take a huge effort. So it boils back down to: What’s it worth, and what’s it all about?”
Probably not worth the cost or manpower, experts agree. “Doesn’t seem likely to be fruitful and is almost certainly not good science,” Grant says. “We don’t need to one-up Utah.”
And yet, Coloradans have tried.
Kebler Pass has become the unofficial contender. The 30-mile stretch west of Crested Butte looks impressive all right, with fall gold rolling as far as the eye can see.
But, says Mitton: “That doesn’t mean a single aspen clone goes for miles and miles.”
He glances at a famous John Fielder photo — perhaps one that contributed to Kebler’s reputation. The shark teeth-like promontory known as the Dyke scrapes the sky above a multicolored canopy, different shades of green, yellow, orange and red all clustered at different heights, all growing, seemingly, as separate brothers and sisters. “I suspect those are different clones,” Mitton says.
But that’s just one snapshot of an immense forest. Could a mighty clone spring elsewhere on the pass? Or, perhaps more likely, elsewhere in the state?
The question is likely to linger with more pressing matters facing aspen.
One is the phenomenon known as sudden aspen decline. A thin shield of bark has always made stands susceptible to parasites and disease. But the U.S. Forest Service reports that in this century whole swaths have been observed healthy one year, dead and dying the next. The agency suspects warmer temperatures are making the trees more stressed and vulnerable.
“Generally speaking, they’re not very well adapted to drought and long-term drought conditions,” says Jim Kravitz with the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies.
Man-made climate change is seen as a grim factor. But there are others, Rogers explains — others causing the death of the globe’s largest known organism.
Pando is the victim, too, of mismanagement, Rogers determined in a study released last year. Where hunters and predators once diminished them, deer have rampantly chomped away saplings. Cattle have been allowed to graze, further trampling the clone’s attempt at regeneration.
The result: a village without youth for the future.
“It’s been around for a long time, and now it’s crashing down on our watch,” Rogers says. “That hits me right in the chest. That’s the message. This thing’s survived for a long time, and then we humans at large start fiddling around, and now it’s kind of unraveling.”
And that, he says, is what matters.

Inside View: Silicon Valley Goes Soft

Texto completo: I miss Travis Kalanick. Sure, the former Uber CEO was known to attack colleagues in the boardroom and berate his drivers from the back seat. And yes, when I met him in 2013, he was pacing around with a golf club looking as if he wanted to break a window in his conference room.
But he told me the story of when Uber received a cease-and-desist order from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. Did you cease? I asked. "No." Did you desist? "No" he repeated, asserting that Uber is perfectly legal, and that the agency didn't have jurisdiction anyway. That was a bold move -- just the kind that Silicon Valley is missing these days.
I'm not condoning the culture that festered under Mr. Kalanick. He famously wrote an email to the "Uber Team" before a Miami off-site meeting in which he advised, among other things: "Do not throw large kegs off of tall buildings." It isn't bad advice, but it shows he had a lot of growing up to do -- much like the 22-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, whose card read: "I'm CEO, Bitch." Uber during his tenure was also known for shrugging off sexual-harassment claims. Mr. Kalanick was replaced for a reason.
The problem is that too many in the media don't distinguish between Uber's rotten corporate culture and its legitimately bold business practices. Instead both get placed under the same umbrella of "toxic bro culture," as if everyone in Silicon Valley is a misogynist Neanderthal strutting around with his baseball cap on backward.
Tragically, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Silicon Valley has gone wussy on us -- wait, can I even say "wussy" anymore? The New York Times suggests tech workers are all experiencing "existential dread" and in need of therapy. Bad leadership is to blame.
Everyone is caving in like an overcooked souffle. Mr. Zuckerberg says the era of self-regulation is over. Microsoft President Brad Smith says the tech sector should embrace regulation. Apple's Tim Cook, who practically invented the global supply chain, met with President Trump to beg him to lift tariffs -- from Apple, but not everyone else.
Amazon has surrendered on multiple fronts, raising its minimum wage to $15 to quell claims it paid "starvation wages" and committing to carbon neutrality by 2040 despite knowing full well that the real problem is Chinese coal plants, which power the factories that make the products Amazon ships.
What happened? Silicon Valley suffers from a classic case of Stockholm syndrome: Its leaders have developed sympathy for their government and social-justice captors. Facebook and Uber spent millions on cringeworthy TV commercials apologizing for misdeeds. Facebook ought to update its iconic signs to read, "Move fast and break things -- and then apologize profusely."
Through his bravado, Mr. Kalanick (along with John Zimmer at Lyft) invented a revolutionary business model that has changed how as many as a billion people work, live and don't drive home after a few beers. Could such a breakthrough happen today? Who will cattle-prod economic deadweights like health care, education and government?
Investigations into tech's competitive behavior make the problem worse. It came out last week that Snap has been collecting examples -- in a dossier it calls "Project Voldemort" -- of aggressive tactics Facebook uses to try to squash Snap. Of course Facebook uses aggressive tactics, much as GM did to Ford, Macy's to Gimbels, Boeing to Airbus, Coke to Pepsi. If done legally, that's the American way. Without competition, you get stagnation.
Are there any leaders with backbones anymore? I've met a few but most seem timid. The hot companies are fake-meat producers whose "burgers" taste like burned Styrofoam, and some crypto and blockchain companies with almost zero real-world applications. Autonomous cars have been subsumed by traditional auto makers. I'm not sure many of the fashion/fitness/lifestyle companies should even be considered technology plays. Then there's the WeWork dude who was only good at squandering $10 billion, allegedly self-dealing and smoking weed until stepping down as CEO. He's not the role model we're looking for.
It's time for Silicon Valley to stop being defensive and start playing offense again. There are tiny signs of hope. Facebook refused, at first, to take down a fake video of Nancy Pelosi that made her seem drunk. After the inmates took over the asylum at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai banned "political debate" on internal discussion boards, in effect telling his workers to #ShutUpAndCode.
Then there's Uber's response to California's new rule that reclassifies temporary and gig workers as full-time employees unless their jobs are "outside the usual course" of business. Not quite a cease-and-desist order to ride-sharing companies, but close. Uber reacted by claiming "drivers' work is outside the usual course of Uber's business, which is serving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces." Sounds a tad far-fetched -- but woo-hoo, some backbone! Mr. Kalanick would be proud.

Texto completo: Drudge Report, which got its start as a Clinton nemesis, pivots to Trump
"Impeach Yourselves!" read the banner headline on Breitbart.com Wednesday morning, summing up what much of the right-wing news world thinks of the congressional impeachment inquiry into President Trump that had been launched the previous day.
"The psychotic anti-Trump hysteria has now completely overtaken the entire Democratic Party," Fox News anchor and Trump booster Sean Hannity told nearly 4 million viewers Tuesday. "They think anytime a Republican is elected president, there must have been something 'illegitimate' going on," Kevin D. Williamson wrote in the National Review on Thursday.
So far, so typical. This is, after all, the umpteenth Trump scandal to set the country's mainstream news outlets on fire while conservatives roll their eyes.
But there's one conspicuous exception: The legendary Drudge Report has in recent days been spewing ALL CAPS, bolded, underlined, and sometimes bright-red headlines that sound terribly grim for the president.
"HILL ROCKED"
"REPUBLICAN CRACKS EMERGE"
"AMERICA BRACES FOR IMPEACHMENT"
These were presumably written by the elusive Matt Drudge, who has been courted by Republican presidents and would-be presidents since he helped bring about President Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998 using exactly the same website and screaming all-capital type. In some ways, Drudge's fervent coverage of "IMPEACHMENT 2019" is a return to form. But it's also an extraordinary break between the right-wing Internet's godfather and its favorite president.
Drudge, who could not be reached for comment, exploded out of obscurity during the Clinton era, when he turned his political gossip blog into a fount of juicy scoops about the president.
"EXCLUSIVE . . . MORE THAN 75 PIXS THAT SHOW LEWINSKY/CLINTON TOGETHER!" read a typical headline. "LEWINSKY THREATENED SUICIDE OVER CLINTON."
Some media watchdogs complained that Drudge's scoops often proved imaginary, but Drudge nevertheless broke the news on Jan. 17, 1998, that Newsweek was sitting on a story about Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, which helped elevate an obscure D.C. rumor to front-page news and congressional intervention.
Drudge then became more or less the spiritual founder of and gatekeeper to the emerging conservative Internet. "Call it the Drudge effect," Chris Cillizza wrote in The Washington Post in 2007, after the website disrupted Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination by posting an old video of him praising abortion rights.
Drudge's favor became almost a necessity for any Republican who wanted to win or keep national office. The New York Times reported that the campaigns of both President George W. Bush and the party's 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, employed unofficial emissaries to Drudge, tasked with keeping him and his millions of readers on their side.
Even Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had one in her 2008 primary fight: consultant Tracy Sefl, who was nicknamed the "Drudge Whisperer" for her ability to get positive Clinton headlines on the site.
"It's been a big mistake for conservatives to assume that Drudge is not pliable," Sefl told The Washington Post. "His loyalties are to himself and to the site, not to the party."
But on the whole, the Drudge Report has reliably derided Democrats and championed Republicans.
Trump was no different, at first.
In the final weeks of his presidential race with Hillary Clinton in 2016, the Drudge Report ran oversized headlines falsely claiming her husband, Bill, had a secret love child.
The site announced Trump's inauguration with a two-word, plus-seven size headline: "AMERICA AGAIN!"
Trump has returned the affection, once taking a break from his State of the Union preparations to tweet an image of the Drudge Report, which had just dubbed him "TEFLON DONALD." His campaign has gone so far as to send fundraising emails that mimic the website's typewriter/ransom-letter aesthetic.
It's unclear what, if anything, caused the Drudge-Trump bond to fray this summer. CNN's Oliver Darcy noticed it last month, pointing out in newsletters that Drudge had been hammering Trump over economic news for several consecutive days.
And then came Tuesday's impeachment announcement, and the deluge of red, bold and underlined Drudgelines:
"COMPLAINT ALLEGES COVER-UP"
"DEMS SPEED IT UP"
"IMPEACHMENT 2019"
"It may be a strange thing to say, but Drudge is making a journalistic decision here," said Tom Rosenstiel, the executive director of the American Press Institute. "Not only is he leaning in, but the places he's linking to are an interesting range: the Hill. MSNBC. It's not just Ann Coulter; it's also Peggy Noonan," referring to the far-right and more moderate commentators, respectively.
"He's a weather vane, in a sense. If you're a Republican or conservative or an operative and you're trying to see which way the wind is blowing, the tone of Drudge has to have an effect on you. This is a signal. This is bad."
Sefl, the Hillary Clinton campaign adviser, didn't find Drudge's break with Trump very surprising given his involvement with the country's previous impeachment scandal. "A story of this magnitude is his caffeine," she said.

Texto completo: The French existentialist writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who died nearly 40 years ago, may be best remembered today for a line from "No Exit," his most famous play: "Hell is other people."

For Aaron Polk's Twin City Theatre Company production, which opened Friday night, the line is plastered across promotional material as a signal of what is to come. Across 90 minutes, a brief enough time to spend in hell and still make it home before the 1944 curfew in German-occupied Paris, three characters engage one another's petty fears and deepest agonies.

About 10 days before the opening of the current production, however, the lead actor departed, which forced director Polk to step into the male role of Cradeau. Suddenly, the production's mantra about hell and "other people" had become even more pointed. As Polk led his ensemble toward opening, acting coach Jude Love stepped in to assist the company along the way. Complicating matters further, The News-Gazette attended the final dress rehearsal in order to make our publication deadline.

As the first scene unfolded on the tiny stage at SoDo Theatre in downtown Champaign, there was a palpable air of nerves as Polk and Dylan Heck, as a tuxedoed concierge, enter the small, windowless room where the action occurs. The lights are bright and the room is excessively warm, the characters tell us, which may be Sartre's ironic echo of the lack of electricity and heat in wartime France -- though we certainly expect a little extra warmth "down there."

The performance began to find its footing with the introduction of Inez, played by Gabrielle Smith as a strong-shouldered 1940s dame from a Hollywood movie. It is an interesting choice, which softens the impact of Sartre's original creation, delineated in the text as one of "those women."

It is a euphemism for Inez's amorous preference for women. More important than sexual preference, though, is Inez's sadistic streak: She wants to torture everyone whom she encounters. In this particular character flaw, we wonder how Inez might be received in today's culture.

The final piece of the puzzle is the addition of Antonella Ortiz as the vain, beautiful Estelle whose comely charms will stir the pot and agitate tensions in the room. Each of the three narrates how he or she came to be in this place. To be sure, their stories will change as pressures of time and space begin to mount. Ultimately, it becomes clear that each of the characters wants something from one of the others -- needs it, really. How, do you suppose, that is going to work out for them? They are in hell, after all.

Under Brian Hagy's serviceable lighting design, an excess of illumination appropriately discomfits the characters. There is just one lighting effect employed, and it puzzles as it eliminates a source of potential tension when a sealed door suddenly flies open. The red fires of hell beckon just beyond the doorway. Would it not create a more difficult choice if the unknown lay beyond the opening?

As for Sartre's famous line about hell and other people, you have surely experienced it while packed like a sardine on an airplane. To the French philosopher, however, it likely meant that we are imprisoned by the power we give those whose judgment tortures us -- and we still crave.

The door is in our own minds and we can open it at any time.

Texto completo: The footsteps Bernie Sanders is hearing belong to Elizabeth Warren. The problem for the Vermont senator is that those footsteps are ahead of him, not behind him, in Iowa at least and perhaps soon in the rest of the country.
Think of this phenomenon as the red shift applied to politics.
Both candidates lean to the left, to be sure, but the Massachusetts lawmaker is leaning forward and has passed Mr. Sanders in the Hawkeye State, where presidential candidates' reputations are made, and has passed her fellow New Englander in the hearts of many liberals. She poses a direct threat to Mr. Sanders in New Hampshire, where he chalked up an important victory in 2016, and may now be the contender former Vice President Joseph R. Biden fears the most.
From the start, political professionals saw the 2020 Democratic campaign as a contest with various "lanes" - a minority/diversity lane comprised of Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, a moderate lane comprised of Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and an assortment of lesser-known figures, and a progressive lane consisting of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
Much of that theory has collapsed. Mr. Biden, who occupies a lane of his own, is by far the principal candidate among moderates, Ms. Harris has failed to catch fire (but hopes for a revival in South Carolina) and Mr. Booker has shined in debates but his prospects have dimmed on the ground ( and he has spoken openly of abandoning the race).
Ms. Klobuchar at one time was the contender the Donald Trump camp dreaded facing. The reasons: She is nice, he is not. She is introspective, he is not. She has appeal in the vital voter group comprised of women in the suburbs, he does not. But she, too, has failed to catch fire, even in Iowa, which shares a border with her home state - a distinct advantage, as Rep. Richard A. Gerhardt of Missouri, who came in first, and Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who finished second, discovered in the 1988 Democratic caucuses.
That leaves the liberal lane and, thus far, Ms. Warren has outperformed her progressive rival in many regards.
Ms. Warren is fresh, Mr. Sanders is stale. Ms. Warren engages a crowd, Mr. Sanders lectures it. Ms. Warren's story is one of prevailing against adversity, Mr. Sanders' story is one of being an adversary of virtually everyone he has ever met. One more: Ms. Warren emits a sense of fun, Mr. Sanders emits a sense of weary travail.
Ms. Warrem seems to be on a magical mystery tour. Mr. Sanders seems to be croaking the song "Yesterday."
There are, of course, second acts in American political life, which is why Richard Nixon could win the presidency in 1968 after losing it in 1960, and why Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, Ronald Reagan, John McCain and Mitt Romney could win presidential nominations the second time around after losing, respectively, to John F. Kennedy (1960), Humphrey (1968), both Nixon (1968) and Gerald Ford (1972), George W. Bush (2000) and McCain (2008).
But to prevail a second (or, in Reagan's case, a third) time takes a special character and special circumstances.
Two case studies provide illuminating examples. In 1968, it took the assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and the collapse of the GOP presidential campaigns of Gov. George W. Romney of Michigan and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York to produce the Nixon-Humphrey race. Undaunted by defeats to Nixon and Ford, Reagan finally prevailed in 1980.
Then there is the age factor. Ms. Warren is 70 years old, but Mr. Sanders is eight years older. His message is virtually identical to that of 2016, though he freshened it with last week's proposal to eliminate medical debt. Even so, the whole "Feel the Bern" movement has a shopworn feel. He resists entreaties to modernize his approach - it worked last time, after all, and it shows consistency and a certain rusticated authenticity, even though he was born in Brooklyn.
Each presidential race is different, of course, and for Mr. Sanders to prevail in 2020 some elements have to fall in his favor- an embarrassing misstep by Mr. Biden, for example, or an unseemly revelation involving Ms. Warren. The former is likely, the latter not so much.
But it is more likely that the unlikely emergence of Mr. Sanders at all in 2016 is the special circumstance. It was that race that elevated a senator of little prominence and few prospects from a curiosity into a contender. For years, hardly anyone paid any mind to the Vermonter on Capitol Hill - he was regarded as a wacky socialist who could have emerged only from the granola precincts of Burlington, Vt. - and he had little impact except as a gadfly.
But the important factor was less Mr. Sanders than his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who campaigned on an "inevitablity" platform that Mr. Sanders transformed into a liability. If she were the anointed candidate of the party elites, then in the eyes of Mr. Sanders and the following he swiftly acquired, she was by definition an unacceptable candidate in a campaign year when the elites were discredited. It did not help Ms. Clinton's cause that she was awkward on the stump, stiff, over-prepared and over-scripted.
Mr. Sanders does not have that sort of foil this time. Ms. Warren is over-prepared in an entirely different way: brimming over with policy ideas, many of them indistinguishable from those of Mr. Sanders but presented in a cheerier, more approachable way. Ms. Clinton was programmed, Ms. Warren is spontaneous. Having her dog along helps in appearances in New Hampshire, which instinctively distrusts anything with the faintest odor of Massachusetts (the taxes are too high, the tourist visitors too pushy) but which nonetheless has given its first-in-the-nation primary victory to Bay State candidates five times since 1960.
Still, Mr. Sanders retains a hold on second-place outside of Iowa, though it is hard to deny that Ms. Warren has the momentum. Both would beat Mr. Trump if the election were being held right now, which it isn't. Ms. Harris would be in a statistical tie with the president, but of course polls this early rarely have any meaning except to political writers who don't have the sense to ignore them.

Texto completo: A majority of studies on marital satisfaction suggest that couples are less happy after they become parents, though the degree and length of unhappiness is more of an open question. Deeply unpleasant thoughts about your spouse will probably flit through your mind at some point during your child's first year, mostly because of the extreme exhaustion infants create in their parents. (There's a reason extreme sleep deprivation is considered torture.)
I spoke to three experts -- a New York Times best-selling author, a sociologist and a relationship-focused psychotherapist -- about how to keep relations as positive as possible during your transition into the first years of parenthood. All of the experts I spoke with said that taking a transparent, proactive approach to dividing the household work -- including child care -- was the No. 1 way to keep the rage-beast of new parenthood at bay.
Don't be surprised if you're unhappy. Though it's normal for satisfaction to decline in any relationship over time, research performed within the past decade suggests that new mothers may be most vulnerable to that dip. Sociologists theorize that, in heterosexual relationships, mothers are more unhappy with their marriages after they have children because they tend to take on more "second shift" work -- child care and housework -- and begin to feel that their relationships are no longer fair. Surveys have shown that whether they work or not, mothers are doing more child care than fathers are.
There is less data about same-sex and gender nonconforming couples, but there is some, albeit dated, evidence that biological mothers in lesbian couples spend more time doing child care than their partners do (though their partners still spend more time on child care than fathers in heterosexual relationships). Lesbian and gay couples tend to divide housework in a more egalitarian way than heterosexual couples do.
Strive for equality in parental leave. If at all possible, make sure both partners are taking identical amounts of leave. Jennifer Senior, an Op-Ed columnist at The Times and the author of the best-selling "All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood," said imbalance in leave-taking could set the stage for an imbalance of caretaking that could last for years. The parent who takes less leave has less experience soothing the baby. So the parent who takes more leave -- almost always the biological mother -- becomes the default "baby whisperer," because she has more experience. It's hard to get out of that pattern once you're in it.
In countries where parents tend to take equal amounts of leave, like Canada or Sweden, marital satisfaction rates are higher.
The unfairness extends even to sleep: Past research has found that working mothers in America are significantly more likely to get up during the night with a sick or wakeful child than working fathers are -- and sleep is more equal in countries with more egalitarian policies in place.
Manage your expectations. "Take the image of the ideal parent and throw it in the garbage," said Leah Ruppanner, a sociologist at the University of Melbourne who specializes in family and gender. She gives this advice especially to mothers, because there are much more aggressive cultural expectations about what a good mother is supposed to be.
According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans still believe that women do a better job caring for new babies than men do (only 1 percent of Americans think men do a better job), and almost 80 percent believe women face a lot of pressure to be an involved parent.
List all tasks and divide them fairly. Ms. Senior suggested that parents should list all of their household tasks, including child care, and divide them in a way that seems fair -- not equitable. For example: If one partner works 15 hours more a week than the other partner, then that parent will probably be doing fewer hours of house- and child-related work.
But all the experts we spoke with agreed that ad hoc arrangements led to the most strife (and, in heterosexual couples, usually leave the mother feeling cheated). Merely making the list provides a way for parents to work through all of the potential pain points.
Get granular with your list. The writer Alix Kates Shulman created a "Marriage Agreement" with her husband when she had children so that household responsibilities would be distributed fairly. She wrote about it in 1970, and her list gets very specific: "Transportation: Getting children to and from lessons, doctors, dentists, friends' houses, park, parties, movies, library, etc. Making appointments. Parts occurring between 3:00 and 6:30 p.m. fall to wife. Husband does all weekend transportation and pickups after 6."
Ms. Senior said you should get as granular as possible when you're listing and dividing chores -- the more specific you get, the less resentment will fester.
Don't be a maternal gatekeeper. Some mothers believe themselves to be the superior parent and engage in what sociologists refer to as "maternal gatekeeping" -- they mediate their spouses' interactions with their children. Practically speaking it often means nit-picking: "Why are you swaddling Ruby that way?"; "Jasper doesn't like his bottle so cold." If mothers want child care to be divided fairly, they have to let fathers do things their own way, even if it's not your way. (If the child is truly in danger, that's another story -- you should always intervene in that case.)
"You're letting them learn how to respond to the kids," Dr. Ruppanner said. "They learn how to do it. It's not astrophysics."
She suggested that if a parent was really struggling not to meddle, that person should physically leave the house when the other parent is on duty -- go for a run, take a nap, give yourself some personal time.
Redefine your sex life. Having a child is a "complete reorganization of the structure of your life," said Esther Perel, a psychotherapist and the author of the book "Mating in Captivity: Unlocking Erotic Intelligence" -- and that includes your sex life.
Many biological parents are given the go-ahead to have sex six weeks postpartum, but that's because "at six weeks you can be penetrated without tearing," Ms. Perel said; it doesn't mean you're ready for it physically or psychologically. She added that it could take as long as a year before you're ready to have penetrative sex -- so don't be discouraged if you're feeling uneasy at six weeks. It takes time to re-establish the rhythm and get used to a changed body and a restructured life.
Parents who gave birth need time to recover, and nursing parents may experience vaginal dryness because of lowered estrogen levels. About 90 percent of mothers resume sex within six months of birth, though 83 percent are experiencing sexual issues three months postpartum, and 64 percent are still experiencing issues at six months.
Ms. Perel encouraged parents to "broaden their erotic interests" outside of penetrative sex and experiment with new erogenous zones. Continuing to connect sexually is important for keeping those hostile feelings at bay, for both parents. "On the long list of what your kids need, making sure the couple remains intimately connected remains very high," Ms. Perel said. "There's nothing holding a family together except the contentment of the couple."
The Gist The vast majority of parents are less satisfied with their marriages after they have children. Mothers in heterosexual relationships report the lowest levels of marital satisfaction. It is mostly because they tend to take on more housework and child care than their partners do. Listing and dividing household tasks (including child care) make both partners feel a greater sense of fairness, though those tasks do not have to be divided 50/50. Maintaining a sexual connection is also important -- and re-establishing that connection takes time postpartum.

Texto completo: For The New York Times Food Festival, Pete Wells lists the 10 places where he'd open his own wallet to dine.
When The New York Times asked me to help choose restaurants where a series of dinners will be held in late September and early October, I started by thinking of all the places where I'd spend my own money. The list was ultimately narrowed to 10. Here they are, in alphabetical order, along with some reasons they're among my favorites.
Adda Indian Canteen
To open up their menus and dining rooms to a younger, looser spirit, Indian chefs around the city have borrowed ideas from gastro pubs, noodle bars and cosmopolitan tasting counters. Chintan Pandya may be the most inventive of the bunch. His menu at Adda Indian Canteen in Queens issues a challenge that New Yorkers have been happy to accept; on any given night you can see eyes popping as dishes like chicken liver masala and bheja fry -- goat brains with ginger and fresh green chiles -- come swaggering out of the kitchen.
31-31 Thomson Avenue (Van Dam Street), Long Island City, Queens ; addanyc.com .
Atomix
Atomix's multicourse menus show off Korean ingredients that are rarely seen here, like tangerine vinegar. They take startling leaps with everyday Korean foods like jook, introduce modern versions of traditional Korean crafts like pottery and even incorporate the work of contemporary Korean fashion designers and architects.
104 East 30th Street (Park Avenue South) ; atomixnyc.com .
Frenchette
In other parts of the country, French food might signify the old, the passé, the establishment that had to be overthrown. In New York, it still supplies fresh inspiration. At Frenchette, the chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson draw energy from the more forceful and blunt side of the cuisine, the organ-eating side. There are exemplary sweetbreads with a veal-crayfish reduction, buttered snails dropped into soft-scrambled eggs, a pink plank of guinea hen terrine, and so on. These things may be traditional, but they don't come across that way. Setting the tone for the whole experience is the wine list, which assembles major and minor members of the natural-wine movement in France and abroad. These winemakers, like the chefs, follow ancient methods and concoct new ones where they have to.
241 West Broadway (North Moore Street) ; frenchettenyc.com .
I Sodi
There is just one way at Rita Sodi's unassuming neighborhood restaurant. It is Ms. Sodi's way, which is otherwise known as the Tuscan way. She is a strict traditionalist, convinced that success lies in doing things according to the old rules. You come to I Sodi not to be dazzled by novel combinations but to be impressed by how carefully everything is done: the translucent skin on the fried chicken; the square tortelli with chestnuts in the dough and the filling; the many thin layers of the lasagna; the classical proportions of the Negronis. The cocktail menu listed eight variations at last count, a rare example of Ms. Sodi's allowing deviations from custom.
105 Christopher Street (Bleecker Street); isodinyc.com .
Jeju Noodle Bar
No other country's food has been interpreted as relentlessly, intelligently and creatively by New York chefs over the past decade or so as South Korea's. At Jeju, in the West Village, Douglas Kim brings a refined sensibility to Korea's version of ramen. Called ramyun, it is a basic comfort food that in his hands takes on unexpected depth and nuance.
679 Greenwich Street (Christopher Street) ; jejunoodlebar.com .
King
Although it opened three years ago, King gives the impression that it has been sitting on the same corner west of SoHo forever. It has the relaxed self-assurance and command of details that come with age. The kitchen, which is run equally by Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, pays homage to the cooking of southern France and northern Italy; they never seem to strain for effects, but somehow they know how to locate a little extra flavor, how to finish a dish with a delicate flourish.
18 King Street (Avenue of the Americas) ; kingrestaurant.nyc
Mama's Too
The slice is to New York what the taco is to Los Angeles. Its basic elements are currently being taken apart and put back together again by pizza people whose sensibilities, by and large, were not shaped by culinary school and whose businesses are not ashamed of their paper-plate and sneeze-guard heritage. One of the leaders of this homegrown movement is Frank Tuttolomondo at Mama's Too. He learned the trade in his parents' nearby pizzeria, Mama's, before embarking on a private course of study on such mysteries as overnight fermentations and pepperoni cups.
2750 Broadway (106th Street) ; mamastoo.com .
Misi
Misi is one of the most exciting places in the city to eat pasta, which is made in a separate, climate-controlled room, far from the heat of the kitchen. The shapes run from the familiar (mezze rigatoni, fettuccine) to the unusual (stamped coins known as corzetti) and the sauces are traditional, too, although one of the great skills of Misi's chef, Missy Robbins, is to put a distinctive spin on her cooking without doing anything that would annoy an Italian grandmother. Misi is not as well known as a place to eat produce, but the vegetables are bright, vibrant and exciting, whether tossed with pasta or starring in antipasti, alone.
329 Kent Avenue (South Fourth Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn ; misinewyork.com .
Sushi Nakazawa
Since Daisuke Nakazawa opened his omakase sushi parlor in 2013 in the West Village, similar spots have turned up all over Manhattan, and prices have ballooned. At least the cost of a sushi dinner in one of the black-leather casino chairs at Nakazawa has stayed constant at $ 150. Certain Nakazawa preparations -- the scallop with a tiny, fiery dab of yuzukosho; the live spot prawns whose heads are fried and served as a chaser after their tails have appeared in the form of nigiri -- have become touchstones for sushi freaks.
23 Commerce Street (Bedford Street) ; sushinakazawa.com .
Torishin
There is an omakase counter at Torishin, in Midtown, along with other counters and tables where you order from the menu. What you order at Torishin is not raw fish, though. It is chicken, skewered and grilled over charcoal, and you must specify the precise part of the anatomy that interests you: hearts, gizzards, livers, skin from the neck or the belly, tenderloins or tendons, for starters. Torishin is not the only yakitori spot in town, but it is the most conscientious, the one where you are most likely to taste a chicken tail cooked exactly as long as a chicken tail should be.

Texto completo: In the city where my grandfather was saved, I stood with a young Jewish couple under their wedding canopy.
I spend a lot of time in cemeteries. It's part of the gig: I'm a rabbi. And my Hebrew name -- Avraham Yitzhak -- is common enough that I often see myself on gravestones, an eerie reminder of the liturgy we'll recite this Rosh Hashana: "A man's origin and end is from dust."
But last month, I came face to face with my actual name: Avram Mlotek. There it was, on a stone right next to that bearing the name of my grandfather, Joseph Mlotek.
I found their legacies in Vilnius, a city that once teemed with Jewish life. For centuries before World War II, it was called the "Jerusalem of Lithuania" and bustled with synagogues, schools and Yiddish writers. Jews of my generation often know much about how these ancestors died, but little about how they lived. Going to Vilna, as it is known in Yiddish, was a reminder of that vibrancy. It was also a painful reminder that culture alone is not enough to protect a people.
The Mloteks, though, were not longtime residents of that dynamic city. When they came to town it was because they were running for their lives.
It was September 1939. My grandfather, my zeyde, was 21 years old and working for a socialist newspaper, Der Folksaytung, in Warsaw. When the Nazis invaded Poland, he fled to Vilna, where he helped collect refugee testimonies. When the Soviets who controlled Lithuania started arresting Yiddish writers, my zeyde went into hiding. In hiding, he learned that one of his brothers had made it to town. He did not know which brother it would be until there was a knock on his door.
Avram and Joseph somehow learned that a Japanese diplomat was granting exit visas out of a nearby city, Kaunas. They waited in line for days in Kaunas (Kovno in Yiddish) and were among the last people to meet the righteous Chiune Sugihara. All told, he saved approximately 6,000 Jews, the Mlotek brothers among them.
Driving along the highway from Vilna to Kovno to see the place where my family was saved, I couldn't help but wonder: How did my grandfather get there? Was it by horse and buggy? Did he walk the 66 miles to Sugihara's home, where thousands of Jews lined up to wait as the diplomat had to sign each refugee's visa personally?
According to Jewish law, one ought to recite a blessing when visiting a site where a miracle took place. In Sugihara's home, which is now a private museum, I opened up a copy of the Mishna Berura, a Jewish legal text written in Poland, on my iPhone.
Standing over the desk where Sugihara sat signing his name, with the names of my own family members on the wall, I said in Hebrew: "Blessed are you, Lord, God of our ancestors, who performed a miracle for my grandfather in this very place."
I repeated the prayer in Yiddish, feeling as if I had seen my own name on a tombstone. And yet, here I was, humbled and alive. I wrote in the sign-in book: "Because of his kindness, I live."
My grandfather's family included Socialists, Communists, Zionists and Bundists, and I often wonder what the conversation around their Sabbath table must have sounded like. Aside from Joseph and Avram, and a sister, Sara, the rest of the Mlotek family was murdered. Could my grandfather, now long dead, have dreamed that his grandson would become a rabbi and one day return to the city he had fled to officiate a wedding?
Some Jews in Lithuania persevere; among them are a young couple in Kovno. The groom's father, the leader of the small Jewish community there, did not speak English; we conversed solely in Yiddish, the primary language of the more than six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, and the language my own father spoke to me before English. Overlooking the green hills, we stood under the huppah and blew the shofar, the ram's horn, as is typical during the Hebrew month of Elul, though not commonly done at weddings.
In just a few days, the Jewish people will mark our new year, 5780. The Bible refers to this day as one of memory, a day of blasts. But what and who are we remembering? The shofar's cry is supposed to wake us up. But for what purpose? These questions, along with the shofar's wail, are my spiritual alarm clock. They, like my grandfather's legacy and the language he spoke, accompany me wherever I go.
Rabbi Avram Mlotek is a founder of Base Hillel, a home-centered ministry for young Jews worldwide.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- Braving an all-out Taliban threat and the fatigue of repeated flawed elections, Afghans on Saturday voted to choose a president for a country suffering through one of the most violent periods in its recent history.
At a time when there is fighting in nearly two dozen of the country's 34 provinces on any given day, it was feared the election would be marred by widespread bloodshed. While there were dozens of smaller attacks on Saturday, the security forces appeared to have prevented any mass-casualty assaults.
Afghanistan's Interior Ministry said about 68 attacks had been carried out on election targets, resulting in the deaths of three police officers and the wounding of 37 civilians and two army soldiers.
But tallies arrived at by The New York Times, from conversations with local officials across the country, determined that at least 30 security personnel and 10 civilians were killed on Saturday, and at least 40 security forces and 150 civilians wounded -- much higher than the official reports, but in line with the average daily toll of the country's long-running war, now in its 18th year.
The Taliban aren't the only danger posed by this election: There are worries that, as the vote tallying begins, the results could paralyze the government, lead to a prolonged political crisis and complicate efforts to reach a peace deal to end the war. Results are not expected for weeks, and a runoff is likely.
The vote has turned into a battle between two bitter rivals, the incumbent president, Ashraf Ghani, and his government's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah. A dispute between the two men during the fraud-ridden 2014 elections nearly split the country, resulting in an American-brokered unity government.
Saturday's voting took place at about 4,500 polling sites, about 2,500 fewer than during the 2014 election, as violence has spread.
The national election commission in Kabul struggled to calculate exact figures from hundreds of polling sites, as insurgents launched attacks, blocked highways or blew up communication towers that affected phone signals in large parts of the country.
While the flow of information was slowed by attacks on the communication system, the commission's initial figures showed that turnout might be around two million, a historical low.
In parts of the country, including Kabul, complaints trickled in about technical problems. One frequent complaint was that voters could not find their names at the polling stations where they had registered to vote. Such registrations were introduced to curb mass fraud.
The voting also took place amid eroded trust in the country's election bodies, with consecutive elections marked by confusion and fraud -- and election officials often implicated. All 12 commissioners who oversaw last fall's parliamentary election, which resulted in an extended, and sometimes violent, disagreement about who should lead Parliament, were fired, and nine were sent to prison.
Afghanistan's new election commission had promised measures to ensure a cleaner vote, including a mandatory biometric verification process that required a voter's fingerprints and a photo to prevent large-scale ballot stuffing.
But the continuing lack of trust leaves room for a contested result, with Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah, as well as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a militant leader only recently reconciled with the government, all signaling that they see themselves as winning the contest and that any other outcome would indicate fraud.
As polls closed late Saturday, the country's election chief, Hawa Alam Nuristani, seemed confident that her team had managed a less-tainted vote.
"Despite all the challenges, we witnessed the responsible and committed presence of Afghan citizens in voting centers," Ms. Nuristani said. "We witnessed a better election compared to other elections."
Across Afghanistan, it was clear that security was at the top of voters' minds. At a time when wedding halls and educational centers have been hit with deadly bombings, many feared voting queues could be easily targeted by the Taliban, which had vowed to stop the election.
"The turnout is low because of threats," said Najib Jabarkhel, a voter at a heavily guarded polling center in Kabul, the capital. "The Taliban have threatened that if you go to vote, bring your shroud with you."
Protecting the balloting has added to the load of security forces already stretched thin by the daily routine of the war. More than 70,000 soldiers and police officers had been given additional duties of protecting the electoral process, and the country's commando forces carried out dozens of special operations in the days leading up to the vote.
While it appeared that those measures had exceeded expectations in preventing Taliban attacks, an extended political standoff, if it occurs, could threaten the cohesion of the national security forces, which have endured years of conflict and been sustained only with tens of billions of dollars in aid from the United States and its allies.
Reflecting such fears, when they formed a coalition government in 2014, Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah divided the security ministries, with Mr. Abdullah leading the police and Mr. Ghani leading the army.
Western and Afghan officials, however, say the risk that the security forces will be dragged into a political dispute has been reduced in recent years: A younger generation of leaders has made progress in professionalizing the forces, these officials say, and the new leaders are less partisan than their predecessors.
"Our No. 1 priority is securing the day, and making sure Taliban threats are minimized," said Massoud Andarabi, Afghanistan's acting interior minister. He has worked to keep provincial police leaders and others out of politics, he said, "so that we have legitimacy in a difficult time."
Mr. Andarabi said both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah had made clear to him they wanted the security forces to stay clear of their political rivalry.
"Elections will go, institutions will remain," he said.
A total of 18 candidates -- from a former intelligence chief to a former militant leader to a university lecturer and a surgeon -- registered to challenge Mr. Ghani. But campaigning was slow in the initial weeks, as the United States appeared to be nearing a deal with the Taliban that cast doubt on whether these elections would proceed at all amid efforts to reach a wider political settlement with the insurgency.
When President Trump called off the peace talks, the elections became certain again and campaigning intensified.
Both Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani built large coalitions in their bids to win the contest. Many experts and officials suggest a repeat of 2014 is likely, with neither candidate getting the required 50 percent in the first round, forcing a runoff.
Preliminary results are not likely to be determined until Oct. 17 at the earliest, and final results not until Nov. 7 or later.
Mr. Ghani, 70, is an American-educated anthropologist who formerly worked at the World Bank. The first time he ran for office, in 2009, he got about 3 percent of the vote. He became president in 2014 in a disputed election, and has now casts himself as the "state builder," asking for a second term to build strong institutions for Afghanistan.
Mr. Abdullah, 59, is an ophthalmologist who rose through the ranks of the anti-Soviet fighters and then became foreign minister after the Taliban were toppled in 2001. This is his third time running for the presidency.
He is presenting himself as the moderate leader who can work with a broad coalition, in contrast to Mr. Ghani, who has alienated many political leaders -- including his own vice president, who now backs Mr. Abdullah.
A third candidate, Mr. Hekmatyar, made peace with the government only in 2017, leaving behind a small but stubborn insurgency. Mr. Hekmatyar was one of the main faction leaders during civil wars in the 1990s that left Kabul in ruins.
Only fraud could deprive him of a clear victory, Mr. Hekmatyar recently declared, adding a veiled threat.
"Don't make us regret our return, don't make us regret our participation in elections, don't force us to chose another option -- we can do that, and we have the experience of it also," he said.
Reporting was contributed by Najim Rahim from Mazar-i-Sharif, Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Farooq Jan Mangal from Khost, Zabihullah Ghazi from Jalalabad, and Assadullah Timory from Herat, Afghanistan.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- House Democrats have settled on a narrow impeachment inquiry into President Trump centered on his campaign to enlist Ukraine to hurt a political rival, a rapid strategy that will produce hearings within a few weeks and build to a possible vote by November.
That plan was put into action on Friday, when a trio of House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for records of interactions among the president and his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the Ukrainian government.
The Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, which had requested the material about three weeks ago, also scheduled depositions starting next week with five State Department officials, including Kurt Volker, who late Friday resigned as the U.S. special representative for Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Volker drew scrutiny for his interactions with Mr. Giuliani and an aide to Ukraine's president.
Mr. Volker in July introduced Mr. Giuliani to Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The State Department has confirmed Mr. Volker introduced Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Yermak, but said Mr. Giuliani was acting in his capacity as a private citizen. State Department officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted earlier this year when she was recalled to Washington, also is scheduled to testify next week.
The Democrats' approach puts control into the hands of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and the Intelligence Committee and paves the way for a rapidly unfolding investigation. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said Friday that members of his committee would work through the next two weeks, while Congress officially is in recess, and he is planning hearings as soon as next week.
The fast action -- and discussions about resorting to a little-known congressional power to detain, arrest or fine recalcitrant witnesses -- suggests the House could vote on articles of impeachment as soon as late October. The Judiciary Committee, which traditionally is the epicenter of impeachment proceedings, would draft the articles.
The Judiciary panel has been investigating a broader array of behavior by Mr. Trump, including issues raised by former special counsel Robert Mueller's report. But Judiciary members haven't publicly complained about the arrangement that now puts the Intelligence Committee in the driver's seat, with a tighter focus.
"There is a dictate that momentum will not slow," said Rep. Jim Himes (D., Conn.), the No. 2 Democrat on the Intelligence committee. "We are determined that momentum will not slow just because members aren't in town."
It isn't yet clear exactly what charge or charges the House might level at the president in its inquiry, which Mrs. Pelosi announced this past week. Some key Democrats have suggested Mr. Trump was guilty of a "corrupt abuse of power" -- potential grounds for impeachment -- when he repeatedly pressed Mr. Zelensky in a July phone call to work with his lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, and Attorney General William Barr on investigations of former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. That conversation came just after Mr. Trump had held up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, fueling criticism that suspending the aid was another way the president used U.S. foreign policy for personal political gain.
A whistleblower complaint released this week, based on information from multiple U.S. officials, alleges that White House officials worked to conceal evidence of Mr. Trump's actions.
Mr. Trump repeatedly has described his call with the Ukrainian president as "perfect" and dismissed the investigation on Twitter as a "Democrat Scam." His Republican allies have made the case that a rough transcript of the call released by the White House shows no explicit demand for a probe in return for the aid.
Mr. Trump also met Friday at the White House with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Trump and Mr. LaPierre discussed how the NRA might be able to support the president politically amid the brewing impeachment fight on Capitol Hill, one of the people said. The New York Times earlier reported the meeting.
"The NRA is not inclined to discuss private conversations with the President," says Andrew Arulanandam, managing director, NRA Public Affairs.
Separately, two House committees said Friday they are probing why the White House delayed the disbursement of aid to Ukraine, sending a letter to the White House budget office requesting written answers and documents about the decision-making process.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
The inspector general for the Pentagon also is considering a request that it open a review of U.S. military aid to Ukraine. The request was made in a letter from Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.).
In the subpoena to Mr. Pompeo, the committees said multiple State Department officials had knowledge of the subject of their impeachment probe and that new revelations raised "troubling questions about State Department officials' possible involvement in the President's efforts to press Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election." They said Mr. Pompeo's failure to share documents impaired the ability of Congress to protect the country's national security and the integrity of its democracy.
The State Department didn't respond to a request for comment.
As the Intelligence panel's Democrats canceled planned events back home, they began identifying people from whom they would like to hear, with particular interest in Messrs. Giuliani and Barr. Democrats also would like to hear from the White House officials who were on the July call.
It appears unlikely that the probe will be bipartisan. Still, at least some Republicans are refraining from criticizing the investigation before it has begun. "It's important to talk to people with direct knowledge to get to the bottom of it," said Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.

Though the Metropolitan Opera opened its season this week, Jaap van Zweden and the New York Philharmonic were not about to cede the field of music drama entirely to their Lincoln Center neighbor. On Thursday, for the second program of his second season as music director, Mr. van Zweden led the Philharmonic in semi-staged performances of two shattering early 20th-century works: Schoenberg's "Erwartung," and Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."
Every aspect of the program was impressive, starting with the inspired idea to pair these pieces, and to play the seldom-heard Schoenberg at all. Mr. van Zweden drew taut, lucid, richly expressive playing from the Philharmonic in both scores. The three singers, especially the blazing soprano Nina Stemme in the Bartok, gave arresting performances. The staging by the director Bengt Gomer demonstrated how to make maximally dramatic use of minimal space.
The monodrama "Erwartung" ("Expectation"), which Schonberg wrote over 17 days of feverish work in 1909, has been called the first Freudian music drama. The text, written by Marie Pappenheim, a poet and doctor who was fascinated by Freud's studies, is the stream-of-consciousness words of a distraught woman, who, jilted by her lover, enters a forest in search of him. Or so it seems.

In later years, Schoenberg wrote that his aim was "to represent in slow motion everything that occurs during a single second of maximum spiritual excitement" -- a single second stretched over half an hour of music. The score was Schoenberg's boldest push to date into atonality, though he never embraced that term. But the unmoored quality of the harmonic language grippingly matches the expressionist, fraught emotions of the drama, as this tormented, nameless woman, here performed by the formidable mezzo-soprano Katarina Karneus, gives voice to her wandering thoughts.

Before "Erwartung" began, the audience saw what looked like an autopsy taking place on a raised platform behind the orchestra: Three surgeons in white coats lifted a sheet to examine a body. Also present were three men in tuxedos.

Behind them, a video showed what looked like the endless corridor of a hospital, with greenish walls, no place to sit, and scattered chrome medical equipment. This all certainly suggested the "silvery cedars" and confusing pathway that the lost woman describes in the text.
She comes across what she fears is a body, though it turns out to be just a tree trunk. She thinks she sees a distant house, but doesn't move toward it. Finally, she stumbles upon something. Another tree trunk? No, it's "his" body, she sings. Is it? And how did he die? In this staging, the body on the table is revealed to be a dead deer. (Talk about a Freudian image.)
The vocal part shifts constantly, along with the teeming orchestral music. Ms. Karneus, singing both with aching lyricism and silvery-edged intensity, gave a riveting performance. Mr. van Zweden made every moment of Schoenberg's restless, multi-stranded music sound, in an eerily shimmering way, beautiful.

"Bluebeard's Castle" -- Bartok's only opera, composed over several years and first performed in 1918 -- is based on a Charles Perrault fairy tale. It tells the story of a brooding, secretive duke, Bluebeard, who brings his new wife, Judith, to his windowless, dank castle. There she sees a row of seven locked doors. Judith (who seems to have a savior complex) is convinced she can bring light to her husband's life and open up his home. With ill-fated curiosity, she demands that he give her the keys to open the doors.
In an opera house, "Bluebeard's Castle" is an invitation for a director to think big, as Mariusz Trelinski did in his 2015 Met production. Mr. Gomer used the constricted space at David Geffen Hall to create a simple, haunting staging. Behind the two singers, a video showed images of a murky tunnel, with industrial cables lining the endless walls. It allowed Ms. Stemme and the baritone Johannes Martin Kränzle to dominate the drama.
Mr. van Zweden conveyed the charged emotions and volatility of Bartok's vibrantly orchestrated score while keeping textures transparent and never swamping the singers. Bluebeard is usually portrayed as stiff, depressed and dangerous. But with his mellow voice and wiry physique, Mr. Kränzle also had a slightly dashing quality. He even egged his young wife into a moment of dancing. You understood better why Judith was drawn to him. Ms. Stemme was stunning, singing with winsome beauty one moment, and flinty power the next. Here was a young wife convinced, foolishly, that her love could redeem a brooding, powerful man.
The doors, suggested by seven silent women in light violet dresses, open to reveal a series of rooms: a torture chamber, an armory, a treasury with gold coins and jewels, a garden, the vista of the duke's domain, a sea of tears. But everything, even the flowers, is stained with blood, Judith keeps remarking. The final door reveals the truth: It is the room where Bluebeard keeps his three previous wives. Judith will now join them.
Officials from the Philharmonic say they are close to finalizing plans for the renovation of Geffen Hall. The new space should be even more conducive to stagings like this one.

Trump's new reality: A TV drama he can't control

Texto completo: Donald Trump's presidency would have been impossible without his reality-TV fame from NBC's "The Apprentice."
And he is skilled at dominating the visual medium that still matters so much - even in our digital age - from his raucous rallies to his impromptu media gaggles outside a whirring helicopter to his symbiotic relationship with Fox News.
But not this week.
In a tectonic shift of media attention, every major television network - broadcast and cable alike - focused on a deeply damaging story that Trump can't control.
On Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that impeachment proceedings would begin.
On Wednesday, Trump responded in a rambling, low-energy news conference from the United Nations, for which all three broadcast networks ditched their usual programming.
Then, for hour upon hour Thursday morning, the networks did the same for the congressional testimony of acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, who was grilled about a whistleblower's report that puts a harsh spotlight on Trump's urging Ukraine's president to dig up dirt about his political rival.
"Almost like moving forward with impeachment would get people's attention," quipped author Jonathan Katz about the media onslaught.
At least some Americans were riveted. As one indication, Whistleblower Wednesday brought sky-high cable ratings - including on Fox, where Trump defenders were working tirelessly in prime time but where news coverage couldn't fully avoid, or spin, the obvious.
And even those who weren't all that interested could hardly avoid it.
It was thrust before their eyes, including on the three networks' evening news shows, which led their 30-minute broadcasts with substantial segments - not one of which could have made Trump happy. (Those three half-hours are still appointment viewing for more than 20 million people each night, on average.)
Even in this digital age, most Americans still get their news on the tube, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center study - though that, of course, is shifting fast to digital sources, especially smartphones.
In fact, it may be the combination of the incessant online blasts and the negative television imagery that is proving so hard for Trump to control.
"Brace Yourself for the Internet Impeachment," was the headline of a Thursday New York Times article.
"In many ways, it is a made-for-the-internet event," wrote Kevin Roose. 'The political stakes are high, the dramatic story unspools tidbit by tidbit and the stark us-versus-them dynamics provide plenty of fodder for emotionally charged social media brawls."
Frustrated and angry, Trump has ramped up his customary attacks on journalists - and has acknowledged, with an edge of bitter self-pity, that things have dramatically changed.
"I used to be the king of good press," he lamented at the U.N. news conference. "They covered me well - otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here."
He now favors a new adjective of disparagement.
"Much of the press . . . is not only fake, it's corrupt," he said at the same event.
Meanwhile, the White House has abandoned - perhaps foolishly - a traditional way it used to get its message out (and allow itself to be held accountable): the daily press briefing.
It has now been 200 days without one. The new White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, has yet to answer questions from behind the lectern - preferring, apparently, to condemn reporters in writing, whether by tweet or by op-ed in the friendly spaces of the conservative Washington Examiner.
It's about to get worse: Impeachment hearings are sure to flood the media zone with images and words that cannot make the president look good, despite the best efforts of his loyal defenders.
In the new film "Where's My Roy Cohn?" the disgraced lawyer to the mob - and to celebrities, including Trump - is heard speculating in an interview on how he'll be remembered. Cohn confidently predicts that his obituary will emphasize his role as aide to the red-baiting Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy.
His voice then is spookily followed by a photograph of his New York Times obituary. He called it: "Roy Cohn, Aide to McCarthy and Fiery Lawyer, Dies at 59."
The moment of truth for McCarthy and Cohn came in televised hearings when a lawyer for the U.S. Army shut down the senator with his damning accusation: "Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?"
Television made all the difference in 1954, as it did again almost two decades later during the televised Watergate hearings, with their disastrous effect on Richard Nixon's presidency.
Granted, the media world looks nothing like it did in the 1950s or the 1970s.
But then again - for the president - it also looks nothing like it did two weeks ago.

To keep votes safe, $250M only goes so far

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - If the full Senate, as expected, approves a recent committee decision to spend $250 million more to protect the 2020 elections from outside interference, Congress will have devoted at least $630 million toward that goal since Russia sought to influence the last presidential election.
It sounds like a lot, experts say, until the realization that a single state, Pennsylvania, plans to spend at least $125 million to upgrade its voting machines.
And that expense addresses just one vulnerability in an elections system whose security procedures - including vulnerable files of registered voters and inadequate systems for postelection audits - can be even creakier than its voting machines.
State and local election officials are left "rolling the dice" between replacing their antiquated paperless voting machines or upgrading outdated registration databases, said Lawrence 'Norden, the director of the Election Reform Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University.
"Two hundred and fifty million dollars across over 8,000 election jurisdictions doesn't come close to paying for these things in a single year, let alone for elections beyond 2020," he said in an email.
The Brennan Center has estimated that state and local agencies would need nearly $2.2 billion over the next five years to adequately shield elections from tampering.
How much Congress will appropriate for election security this year remains unclear. The House has approved $600 million, but the two chambers are likely to settle on a compromise amount in a legislative conference this fall.
Congress allotted $380 million to the states in 2018, money that has largely been spent or committed to security improvements by the 2020 election season, with much remaining to be done.
That allocation provided $14.1 million of the more than $125 million that Pennsylvania plans to spend on voting equipment, and about $6 million for new voting machines in Louisiana that could cost $95 million.
Colorado received more than $6.3 million from the 2018 grant, and "we have plans to use every penny," Secretary of State Jena Griswold said. But she said a lengthy list of security measures was still unfunded, including safeguards against ransomware attacks; improvements for the state's voter-registration database; protection for county election offices that connect to that database and for computers linked to county offices; an artificial-intelligence system to detect threats to election offices; and a cybersecurity staff to work with counties.
"And that's speaking for a state with some of the best cybersecurity safeguards in the nation," Griswold said. "When you look at other states that don't have recently purchased voting equipment, don't have equipment that's not completely separated from the internet, don't have audits - for them, the need is even more pressing."
Beyond their immediate needs, Griswold and other state officials said, election agencies will need a steady infusion of money to keep their security measures current against the ever-improving skills of potential intruders.
The $250 million allotment in the Senate was the first sign of movement in a standoff over voting security that had stymied a sheaf of legislation even before Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in November.
Since then, the House has passed two sweeping proposals to tighten the elections infrastructure, one of which, the Securing America's Federal Elections Act, recommended the $600 million the House appropriated separately. Other proposals that have yet to pass either chamber would allot up to $1 billion on security before the 2020 election.
Other congressional proposals that have gone nowhere include bipartisan efforts to force social media companies like Facebook to disclose who is paying for political content on their sites and to set rules for cooperation between state election officials and federal intelligence agencies.
Those bills and others have largely been bottled up by Sen. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. McConnell, who after months of criticism for inaction agreed to sponsor the $250 million security package approved last week, said the appropriation would continue the "enormous strides" the Trump administration had made toward more secure elections.
Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the leading Democrats on voting security issues, called the measure a "joke."
"This amendment doesn't even require the funding be spent on election security," he said in a statement. "Giving states taxpayer money to buy hackable, paperless machines or systems with poor cybersecurity is a waste."
That underscored one of the key partisan differences that has blocked voting legislation. Calling it federal intrusion in local elections, McConnell of Kentucky and some other Republicans oppose proposals to tighten oversight of the voting infrastructure, such as limiting the purchase of voting machines to devices that produce a paper ballot. Democrats and other Republicans see such rules as central to shielding systems from outside interference.

Texto completo: Did Trump improperly pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter, as Democrats contend? A timeline of events that led to the release of a five-page summary of Trump and Zelensky's conversation.
July 24
Special counsel Robert Mueller testifies before two House committees about Russia's "sweeping and systematic" interference in the 2016 election. Mueller found numerous contacts between Russians and Donald Trump's presidential campaign but no conspiracy to influence election results.
July 25
President Trump calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, urging him to fight corruption and suggesting he investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had business interests in Ukraine when his father was vice president and working closely with the Ukrainian government.
Aug. 12
A whistleblower reports an “urgent concern” to the inspector general for national intelligence, Michael Atkinson. The New York Times and The Washington Post say the Ukraine call and whistleblower complaint are related.
Aug. 26
After preliminary review, the inspector general finds the complaint credible and reports it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire.
Sept. 9
The inspector general reports the complaint without its substance to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The inspector general says Maguire disagrees that the complaint merits “urgent concern,” which would have required reporting to congressional intelligence committees within seven days.
Three House chairmen – Schiff; Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N. Y. ; and Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md. – announce a wide-ranging investigation into the dealings with Ukraine by Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Sept. 17
The inspector general tells Schiff that Maguire and the Justice Department have told him not to report the substance of the complaint to Congress.
Sept. 19
The House Intelligence Committee meets behind closed doors with Atkinson, who doesn’t disclose details about the complaint.
Sept. 24
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. , announces that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump – the culmination of a months-long investigative battle between Democrats and the White House that came to a head over the president's efforts to press Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.

Texto completo: Almost from the start, "likes" on social media were associated with popularity.
The more you received on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, the more you valued yourself. The fewer likes people get, the more they start to question their self-worth.
That's why Facebook is trying something new – hiding likes.
Thursday, the social networking behemoth said it's testing a feature in Australia that hides the like counter on the Timeline and News Feed.
The person who posts the content can still see how many people engaged with it, giving it a thumbs up. However, the counter is hidden from public view, so friends and followers can't see how many people gave a like. They could still see comments.
Facebook for politicians: Tech giant says it won't 'referee political debates' before 2020 election
'Hide replies': Twitter's new feature helps you moderate responses from trolls
Facebook told The New York Times it had not decided whether to roll out the test beyond Australia.
“We will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people’s experiences,” a Facebook spokesman told the Times. He said Facebook wants to be a place where people feel comfortable expressing themselves.

Texto completo: Ben Platt and Gwyneth Paltrow star in a new Netflix series. And a new horror anthology series is streaming on Shudder.
What's Streaming
THE POLITICIAN Stream on Netflix. Ryan Murphy, the TV creator whose disparate curriculum vitae includes "Glee," "American Crime Story" and "Pose" (to name a few), makes his Netflix debut with this lustrous new series, which stars the Broadway darling Ben Platt. Platt plays Payton Hobart, a Santa Barbara, Calif., teenager of staggering privilege who is running for student body president at his high school -- a race Payton sees as an early step in his plan to eventually make it to the White House. The lavish setting comes with a lavish cast: In addition to Platt, the series stars Gwyneth Paltrow (Payton's wealthy mother), Zoey Deutch (his running mate), Jessica Lange (her grandmother) and, later in the season, Bette Midler and Judith Light. "Often there seems to be nothing but ideas, raised and dispensed with, elbowing aside character, emotional momentum and story coherence," James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times. "The series has enough wit and visual style, though, that it's a pleasure to watch in the moment -- just as long as you don't think beyond the moment."
CREEPSHOW Stream on Shudder. With "It Chapter Two" in theaters and this fall promising both a movie adaptation of "Doctor Sleep" and a second season of Hulu's "Castle Rock," screens big and small have been showing no shortage of Stephen King adaptations. That's good news for fans, who can add a different kind of King-inspired project to their lists in the form of this streaming series. Named after the 1982 anthology film written by King and directed by George A. Romero, this series has tales based on stories by many writers. The first episode pairs an adaptation of King's "Gray Matter" with an adaptation of "The House of the Head," a short story by the novelist Josh Malerman.
What's on TV
FRESH OFF THE BOAT 8:30 p.m. on ABC. This sitcom's stars have gone on to some high-profile projects lately: Constance Wu, who starred in "Crazy Rich Asians," is in theaters opposite Jennifer Lopez in the strip club drama "Hustlers." And Randall Park is on Netflix as a creator and star of the recently released rom-com "Always Be My Maybe." Those projects may bring some renewed interest to the show, which is based on a memoir by the celebrity chef Eddie Huang. Wu and Park play Huang's parents, Louis and Jessica, with the actor Hudson Yang playing a young Eddie. The sixth season's debut episode, airing Friday, concerns Evan (Ian Chen), the youngest son in the family, getting "the talk." Helping Louis in this undertaking, naturally, is a teenage Eddie.
CMT CROSSROADS: SHERYL CROW & FRIENDS 10 p.m. on CMT. Last month, Sheryl Crow released "Threads," a guest-filled record of covers and original songs that Crow has said may be her last full-length album. She performs songs from that record in this one-hour special, bringing with her some of the album's all-star guests: Jason Isbell, Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Joe Walsh, Chris Stapleton and Lucius.

NJ Officials Use Phrase 'Jew Down'

Texto completo: Headnote LOCAL
DURING A SEPT. 5 executive session of the Trenton City Council, the president of that body used the phrase "Jew her down," setting off a debate about semantics and stereotypes.
The phrase was used in reference to a Jewish city attorney's negotiation tactics with a Trenton resident, who had filed a lawsuit against the city after tripping and injuring herself on a city sidewalk. President Kathy McBride believed that the resident deserved more than she had agreed to in her settlement.
"I'm sad for her," McBride can be heard saying on a recording obtained by The Trentonian. "They were able to wait her out and Jew her down for $22,000 with pins in her knee that can never ever be repaired."
Condemnation was anything but swift.
City Councilwoman Robin Vaughan initially defended McBride, and denied that the phrase had any anti-Semitic content.
"I believe her comment 'Jew down' was more in reference to negotiating, not 'I hate Jews,"' Vaughn wrote on Facebook, according to The Trentonian. "Inappropriate in today's PC culture absolutely, but to Jew someone down is a verb and is not-anti-anything or indicative of hating Jewish people."
Another member of the council, George Musehal, told the New Jersey Globe that it was "just a statement of speech."
"You know, it's like a car dealer, they wanted $5,000, you Jew 'em down to $4,000," Musehal told the Globe. "It's nothing vicious. The expression has been said millions of times."
After a few days, McBride, Vaughan and Musehal all apologized, though Musehal told The New York Times that the attorney, Peter Cohen, had told him that he used the phrase all the time, which Cohen disputed. Amid calls to step down, all three have thus far held fast.
Evan Bernstein, director of the Anti-Defamation League's New Jersey and New York chapter, responded on Twitter with: "Anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money are not just 'statements of speech.' Instead, they play on deeply painful myths and stereotypes about the Jewish community that have a long and troubling history. This shows an incredible lack of understanding of the historical significance of this language and the painful impact it can have on Jewish constituents."

There was more contrition in Paterson, New Jersey, after Councilman Michael Jackson used the phrase "Jew us down" at a public meeting about stadium renovation.
"I said, 'Mr. Developer, I respect you, I appreciate you for valuing our city, for offering the best price possible and not trying to go backwards to Jew us down,"' said Jackson at the meeting, according to The Paterson Times. He was roundly criticized by his colleagues, including a council member of Palestinian heritage, who said, "That stuff should not be in this chamber. I never want to hear it in this chamber."
"That statement should have never been made," said Jackson, who claimed the term was once complimentary. "I ask everyone to forgive me for my brief lack of sensitivity. That was meant with no malice. It was a statement indicative of my upbringing."
The idea that "Jew down" is not anti-Semitic - and even has positive connotations, as Jackson suggested, strains credulity. How could it be that someone could use the phrase - reinforcing the stereotype that Jewish people will always seek to drive hard bargains - without seeing that it makes direct reference to Jews?
"It is common for people not to know the origin of phrases with derogatory histories," said Sarah Bunin Benor, a professor of contemporary Jewish studies at Hebrew Union College, who is also the co-editor of the Journal of Jewish Languages. Most people who use the similar term "gyp" or "gip," she said, have no idea that it references "Gypsy," "a derogatory group name for the Roma people."
And yet, "Jew down" seems so unambiguous in its target.
"Let's start with the obvious: Jew down is unequivocally anti-Semitic," wrote Jeffrey Barg in his "Angry Grammarian" column in the Inquirer, responding to the New Jersey lawmakers. "It amplifies hateful historical tropes of Jews as money-grubbing, self-dealing, unscrupulous cheaters who can't be trusted."
The phrase came into existence in the early 19th century and, according to Google n-gram data, peaked in usage in the 1930s. Benor pointed out that this is consistent with the largest waves of Jewish immigration to the United States; however, the stereotype of Jewish tight-fistedness had existed for centuries.
"When people claim that 'Jew down' does not refer to Jews," Benor said, "they are reflecting a common understanding that Jews are not an oppressed group (and therefore it's OK to use derogatory language about them). And when people use this phrase to refer to actions by a Jewish developer, business person, etc., they are reflecting overt anti-Semitism." �

Texto completo: An attorney who promotes forgiveness over punishment in criminal justice, and a landscape architect who transforms neglected urban spaces into places of beauty and community have been named 2019 MacArthur Foundation fellows.
The Bay Area recipients of the so-called MacArthur "genius grants" are Sujatha Baliga, director of the Restorative Justice Project in Oakland, and Walter Hood, a landscape and public artist who has a private studio in Oakland and who is a professor at the UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design.
This year, 26 people received the awards that are intended to encourage people "of outstanding talent to pursue their own creative, intellectual and professional inclinations," the foundation says. Recipients include writers, scientists, artists, teachers and entrepreneurs, and they receive stipends of $625,000, paid out over five years.
Baliga, 48, is a former public defender whose Restorative Justice Project helps develop programs across the country that promote alternatives to incarceration and other punishments for young people accused of crimes.
In such programs, the offender, victim and others affected by a crime typically meet and, with the help of facilitators, come up with ways for the offender to take responsibility, make amends and turn his life around.
"The current criminal legal system often doesn't meet anyone's needs," said Baliga in an interview with this news organization. "Restorative justice offers a way of doing things that doesn't rely on punishment and isolation. In restorative justice, we ask who is harmed, what do they need and who has the obligation to meet those needs."
Baliga speaks from personal experience about how survivors' needs often aren't met. Born to Indian immigrants in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, Baliga said her father sexually abused her through her childhood.
In a 2013 interview with The New York Times, Baliga said she grew up feeling alone and ashamed. She explained that she didn't begin to heal until after she graduated from Harvard University, and learned to let go of her anger during a trip to India before starting law school.
Baliga told the Times she had thought about becoming a prosecutor and locking up child molesters. But then she visitedDharamshala, the Himalayan city that is home to a large Tibetan exile community, including the Dalai Lama. She managed to gain an audience with the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who offered two pieces of advice: Meditate and learn to "align myself with my enemy" and "to consider opening my heart to them."
Baliga said she hopes the MacArthur fellowship brings attention to restorative justice, which she said has the potential to reduce crime, make communities safer and help survivors heal. A study of a restorative justice diversion program offered through Alameda County showed that youth participants were 44% less likely to reoffend than offenders not in the program. Meanwhile, 91% of victims who participated were satisfied with the program.
"The thing I'm most excited about with this fellowship is that I hope it draws national attention to the approach my organization is taking towards expanding access to restorative justice nationally," Baliga said. "It can raise awareness that we can do restorative justice instead of criminalizing young people, especially young people of color."
URBAN LANDSCAPES
Hood, 61, was recently in the news for landing the $20 million project to upgrade the Oakland Museum of California's rooftop gardens, which have become overgrown and unmanageable, according to a UC Berkeley release. Hood plans to create four levels of terraced gardens that represent the different ecological regions of the state and to connect the gardens and open them up to views of Lake Merritt.
Throughout his career, Hood has focused on creating urban spaces parks, gardens, playgrounds that "resonate with and enrich the lives of current residents while also honoring communal histories," according to the MacArthur Foundation.
Hood's speciality is bringing beauty to neglected urban neighborhoods by transforming vacant lots, freeway underpasses and even traffic islands into ecologically sustainable public spaces that residents can enjoy.
"I try to take the most mundane spaces and make people see something beautiful in them," Hood said in a video put out by the Mac-Arthur Foundation. "These can be parks, these can be streets. Everything is a dormant piece of sculpture in the urban environment."
One of Hood's best-known early projects with his Hood Design Studio was Oakland's Lafayette Square Park in 1999, which features a grassy artificial hill for children to play on, game tables and a performance space for nearby residents.
For the Splash Pad Park, across the street from Oakland's Grand Lake Theater, Hood converted an underutilized turn lane beneath Interstate 580 into an urban park that is now the location for the city's largest weekly farmers market.
One of Hood's latest projects has been to design a memorial garden and the landscaping surrounding the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina.
The museum is being built on the site where nearly 40% of enslaved Africans arrived in the United States.
Hood's design features native grasses and a tidal pool whose waters will recede at regular intervals to reveal an engraved pattern of life-size figures, aligned as people were confined within the hold of a slave ship.
"The museum is a great project to show how we honor ecology, history, sustainability and function within a single project," Hood said in the video.

Texto completo: Hulu is set to lose all 180 episodes of the Emmy-Award winning Seinfeld in 2021 after Netflix swooped in with a lucrative deal. It’s true that quality legacy programming, or re-runs, contributes to user engagement and helps to avoid churn, or the rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions in a given period. But it is exclusive originals that drive subscription growth. On that front, Hulu continues to make moves.
The over-the-top platform is developing a one-hour Hardy Boys series based on the beloved source material created by Edward Stratemeyer, Observer has exclusively learned. The show will be a young adult and teen-oriented drama co-executive produced by Joan Lambur and Steve Cochrane. Jason Stone is set to direct. Hulu did not immediately respond to Observer’s request for comment.
Specific plot details for the series are unknown at this time.
The original iteration of the characters, Frank and Joe Hardy, debuted in 1927 as teenage crime-solvers handling cases that stumped the adults in their lives. Since then, the characters have been reimagined several times while remaining successful staples of pop culture. Their books sell more than one million copies annually, per the New York Times , and the characters have appeared in five different television series as well as video games and merchandise. Their most recent small screen appearance came in the short-lived 1995 series The Hardy Boys .
The young adult and teen genre is an increasingly popular target demographic thanks to the success of hit series such as The CW’s Riverdale and Netflix’s Chilling Adventures of Sabrina . The CW is actually set to debut a Nancy Drew TV series in October. The character was also created by Stratemeyer as the female counterpart to the Hardy Boys.
Disney, which assumed full control of Hulu in May and recently shook up its executive hierarchy, will add some muscle to the streaming platform. Leading basic cable network FX, which Disney acquired as part of the Fox deal, will be a significant building block for Hulu. Much of Fox’s other, less family-friendly content will also be rerouted to the streamer. The infusion of resources and content will help Hulu grow its 28 million subscriber base moving forward.
Hardy Boys is expected to begin production in the near future.

Texto completo: Re “Hospital unfazed by bond rating” (News, Sept. 22):
Your article regarding the removal of the CEO of San Antonio Hospital ranks right up there with the recent New York Times report that tried to smear Justice Kavanaugh. It omitted the pertinent information and details of the true financial situation.
The commitment to build the Vineyard Towers addition was already underway when the hospital hired Harris Koenig. In addition, the choice of the contractor (who failed to complete the project up to code) had also been selected.
Because of poor workmanship, the hospital was required to hire a new contractor to repair and replace the unsatisfactory work in order for the new facility to pass inspection and open to the public.
There seems to be a lot more to this story than was published.
— Nancy Ruddock, Alta Loma
More accepting society
Re “Drag queens debate spotlights creepy trend on right” (Opinion, Sept. 13):
Steven Greenhut makes excellent points on the debate on drag queens. In our society, we push down being so different and going against our “norms.”
But as a senior in high school and as the future generation, I applaud those queens for standing up against society and showing them who they are.
Those children are being exposed to this expression, and showing them we can be whoever we choose to be. And hopefully by the time they grow up, our society will be more accepting. People must accept that we are living in an ever-expanding world and society.
— Victoria Neal, Redlands
No taking weapons home
Re “National Guard and guns” (Letters, Sept. 22):
I was in the National Guard for six and a half years. I spent six months on active duty. During that time, I trained with the regular army.
During all the time I spent on active duty and in reserve we were not allowed to take our weapons home. The weapons were locked in the supply room at the armory. The only time we were allowed to use our weapons with ammunition was once a year on the firing range.
I’ve never heard of one soldier killing another soldier during my time on active duty. If we do not trust our military to carry guns, and there have been no deaths, why do we allow untrained personnel to carry guns and ammunition?

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- As the day progressed on Thursday, so too did the rapidly evolving news on the controversial whistleblower complaint and related impeachment inquiry. It's the latest example of a divide in media coverage of President Donald Trump.
The whistleblower complaint lodged about Trump over his interactions with a foreign leader was declassified and made public, the acting national intelligence chief testified before Congress as part of House Democrats' impeachment probe, and news broke that Trump had implied the whistleblower's sources were "spies. "
Throughout the day, prominently featured headlines on news sites and banners across television networks were evidence of how media's framing of issues arguably helps reinforce viewers' ideological perspectives.
More: Joe Biden says Trump tried to 'hijack an election' in wake of whistleblower complaint
For example, just before midday Thursday, as acting National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire testified before Congress and the whistleblower complaint had already been released, the following headlines were featured on major news outlet websites:
The Washington Post: "Whistleblower claimed Trump abused office and White House officials tried to cover it up"
The New York Times: "Whistle-Blower Alleged White House Cover-Up of Ukraine Call"
Fox News: "Maguire Under Fire - Trump intel boss cautions impeachment-driven Dems: Complaint based on ‘second-hand information’"
Breitbart: "Schiff posts deep state complaint… Pelosi humiliated" and "Dossier 2. 0: POTUS seeks ‘interference from a foreign country in the election’. . . . . . Trump covering up Ukraine call transcript!"
As Maguire gave his testimony, conservative-leaning outlets notably chose to focus on the Democratic push for impeachment as well as a perceived slipup from House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, who read what he referred to as a parody of Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president.
"Spymaster Spars: Intel chief's patience with Schiff wears thin after hours of questioning on whistleblower complaint," read a headline on Fox News' website.
More: 'Unique and unprecedented': Intel chief Joseph Maguire cites executive privilege in delaying whistleblower report to Congress
Here were television banners when Congress' questioning of Maguire adjourned midday Thursday:
CNN: "Whistleblower: Trump tried to get Ukraine to interfere in election, and White House tried to cover it up"
Fox News: "House Intel Cmte hearing with acting DNI Maguire wraps on Capitol Hill"
MSNBC: "Acting DNI wraps whistleblower complaint"
CBS: "Acting DNI: Complaint is ‘unprecedented’ and whistleblower ‘did the right thing’ by reporting POTUS-Ukraine call"
ABC: "Maguire: I think the whistleblower did the right thing"
When The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times both reported that Trump had referred to the whistleblower's White House sources as "close to a spy," most news outlets led with that coverage. Those remarks were said at a private event.
"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now," Trump reportedly said.
"Trump threatens US officials who gave information to the Ukraine case whistleblower," a Vox headline read.
Slate's homepage had the following story: "Trump Implies Whistleblowers Should Be Shot, Which May Conflict With Rules. "
Fox News' story based on that private event, not featured as prominently on the website, was titled "Trump slams mainstream media as ‘scum’ and ‘animals’ during private event, criticizes whistleblower. " It did not mention Trump's remarks about spies.
Later in the day, however, another piece was published by Fox News: "Republicans race to identify whistleblower's WH sources as apparent inconsistencies emerge. " It did include the remarks.
More: 'Almost a spy': Donald Trump suggests whistleblower source committed treason as Ukraine firestorm builds
At shortly after 5 p. m. ET Thursday, banners across television news networks read:
Fox News: "Impeachment obsession: Dems press ahead despite lack of public support"
CNN: "Whistleblower: Trump abused power by trying to get Ukraine to interfere in 2020 election, White House tried to cover it up"
MSNBC: "Whistleblower: White House tried to ‘lock down’ records of Pres. Trump’s call with Ukraine president"

'Almost a spy': Donald Trump suggests whistleblower source committed treason as Ukraine firestorm builds

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump lashed out angrily on Thursday at whoever provided a whistleblower with details of his phone call with the president of Ukraine, calling the source of the leak “almost a spy” and suggesting the culprit had committed treason.
“You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?” Trump said, according to published reports. “We used to handle it a little differently than we do now. ”
Trump’s remarks, made at a private event in New York, came as the whistleblower’s complaint was made public and was the subject of a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee. The complaint has prompted House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.
The whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, revealed deep concern that Trump “used the power of his office” to solicit Ukraine’s help to discredit one of his main political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.
The complaint went on to detail efforts by senior White House officials to later "lock down" access to all records of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump urged his counterpart to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
More: Trump's efforts to discredit Joe Biden backfired on him. Will they hurt the former VP anyway?
In New York, Trump reportedly told staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations on Thursday that he wants to know who leaked the information.
“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that’s close to a spy,” he said.
The Los Angeles Times, which reported Trump’s remarks, said it had obtained a recording of Trump’s comments from a person attending the event. The New York Times also published an account of Trump’s remarks.
Bruce Udolf, a former federal prosecutor who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation involving President Bill Clinton, said Trump’s remarks could expose him to potential obstruction of justice or witness tampering charges.
“It’s not clear to me if Trump is more stupid than he is arrogant,” Udolf said, adding that a summary the White House released of the president's conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart also demonstrated that Trump “hasn’t been terribly loyal to his country, either. ”
On Capitol Hill, congressional Democrats expressed outrage at Trump’s comments.
Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. , called them “reprehensible. ”
Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter that Trump's remarks are "a reprehensible invitation to violence" against witnesses in the committee's investigation.
Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. , also condemned Trump’s remarks.
“Whistleblowers who follow the rules, as this one did, are vital to protecting our safety and our freedoms,” she wrote on Twitter. “For the president to threaten this patriotic American with death demonstrates what prosecutors call ‘consciousness of guilt. ’”

Texto completo: The New Haven Register ran a headline on Monday about Justice Kavanaugh, that the NHR picked up from the New York Times. No research was done by the NHR and no witness verification was made by the NHR.
On a day following Iran’s possible attack on Saudi Arabia — with the U.S. on the brink of military intervention — the NHR went with a juicy Kavanaugh story, which the NY Times has now denied and apologized for.
I know nothing “Trump” will be phrased in the positive by the NHR, because the market is very liberal. But, in this situation, a headline apology is in order. Not a page 2 note that “we screwed up.” And, the NHR should be enormously suspect in it’s re-reporting of other publications’ headline stories.

Texto completo: Echoes of Watergate could be heard in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement Tuesday that the House of Representatives will begin a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. But how similar is this path to what the nation experienced 45 years ago?
In 1974, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon as a result of the Watergate scandal, leading him to become the only president to resign. Now Democrats hope their impeachment probe will force Trump from office over allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to give him political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a threat to Trump in the 2020 election.
Just as they were during Watergate, accusations of abusing power for personal political reasons are at the heart of the new impeachment inquiry. Trump allegedly froze congressionally approved aid for Ukraine while asking Zelenskiy to provide possibly damaging information about Biden and his son Hunter.
Similarly, the second article of impeachment against Nixon charged him with abusing his presidential power. Nixon had used the FBI and IRS to hurt journalists, Democrats and other people he didn't like. His administration also created a secret unit to illegally wiretap people and break into their offices. And he used the power of his office to cover up the involvement of his aides in the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C.
Another similarity is the critical role journalists played in exposing critical information that prompted the impeachment inquiries. Over the past week, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post have revealed details of a whistleblower's warning about Trump's phone call with Ukraine's president, the administration's initial refusal to release an inspector general's report about the warning and White House maneuverings to withhold aid to Ukraine.
During Watergate, the Washington Post, New York Times and other news outlets uncovered important details of the Watergate burglary, cover-up and political sabotage efforts.
Like they do now, reporters relied on anonymous sources to disclose much of the information and received the White House's wrath.
Nixon and his supporters accused the press of serving the interests of Democrats and engaging in a witch hunt. Trump tweeted Tuesday that the current inquiry was "Witch Hunt garbage."
A third resemblance is the weak public support for impeachment prior to formal proceedings. Most opinion polls have shown the public opposing Trump's impeachment, with an average of only 38.5% favoring it since the start of 2017. In Nixon's case, public support for impeachment never reached 50% during most of the Watergate investigation. A majority favored removing him from office only after the House Judiciary Committee held its impeachment hearings.

The differences
Those similarities between the Trump and Nixon impeachment efforts are striking, but three key differences could lead to different outcomes.
First, during the Watergate scandal most Americans had a choice of just three television networks, three national news magazines and perhaps a couple of daily newspapers. Although a majority of newspapers endorsed Nixon for reelection in 1972, most media outlets were offering widespread coverage of his administration's crimes by the following year. As a result, it was hard for the public to avoid seeing information about the president's misdeeds.
Now Americans can choose from a multitude of media outlets, many of them highly partisan. Unlike Nixon, Trump has the benefit of outlets such as Fox News and "The Rush Limbaugh Show" that have faithfully backed him, helping him maintain his popularity among conservatives. Trump also has the advantage over Nixon of being able to use Twitter to reach the public directly with his denials and attacks against Democrats and journalists.
Rising partisanship has contributed to another essential difference: declining public trust in public institutions. Once Congress held televised Watergate hearings and the media started covering Watergate extensively, support for impeaching Nixon began to rise.
But since Watergate, the percentage of Americans who have a "great deal" or "quite a lot" of trust in Congress has plummeted from 42% to 11%. Over a similar span, trust in newspapers has fallen from 39% to 23%. This growing wariness of the media and Congress could mean that televised impeachment hearings won't sway public opinion regarding Trump's fitness for office.
Finally, Democrats controlled both the House and Senate during Nixon's presidency. This meant they could steer the impeachment process all the way through a potential trial. The presence of moderate Republicans in the Senate who were appalled by Watergate made it likely that Nixon would have been convicted by the required two-thirds vote if he hadn't resigned first.
Trump has the advantage of a GOP-controlled Senate whose members have loyally backed him and are circling the wagons to defend him against impeachment. Even if the House votes to impeach Trump, the Senate could save him.
Of course, we don't know yet what will be revealed during the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower complaint or other new evidence could contain a smoking gun with Trump's fingerprints all over it. If that happens, it could end his presidency just as tapes of Nixon's conversations -- released four days before his resignation -- showed that he tried to get the CIA to interfere with the Watergate investigation.
But if the impeachment probe doesn't provide any startling new information, it's the Democrats whose political fortunes could be doomed.

Volunteers to help at Parky's Farm for National Public Lands Day Great Parks of Hamilton County will celebrate National Public Lands Day on Saturday, Sept. 28, with a volunteer opportunity at Parky's Farm that will preserve natural resources and protect local native species.
National Public Lands Day is the largest single-day volunteer effort for America's public lands.
"Our work together will be a fun way to have a lasting impact on Parky's Farm, and volunteers will have their own rewards, too," said Dave Liedhegner, Manager of Parky's Farm. "It's very healthy to spend time in the outdoors, and National Public Lands Day is a great reminder of the benefits that come from connecting with nature."
Volunteers will have the opportunity to install a pollinator garden, plant several large trees and maintain a trail at the farm. The pollinator garden is another step in the parks' emphasis on planting and supporting native species and pollinators. The garden will serve an educational purpose for visiting groups to learn about the importance of native species populations. It will also become a tranquil "relaxation station" for Parky's Farm guests.
Trees being planted by volunteers include sycamores, hackberrys and elm trees. On the Woodlot Trail at Parky's Farm, volunteers will remove invasive vines and other non-native species, while also placing new gravel on the trail.
"With each of these projects, we'll have Great Parks' experts on site to teach volunteers at each individual step," Liedhegner added. "So this is also a great opportunity for volunteers to take advantage of the expertise we'll have on hand to learn for their own personal knowledge on how to apply these projects at home."
Volunteers will be working from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., rain or shine, at Parky's Farm in Winton Woods, located at 10073 Daly Road. To ensure enough tools will be provided, pre-registration is required and can be made online at www.greatparks.org/get-involved. Participation is free. Volunteers should dress appropriately for the weather and plan on getting dirty.

Historic farmhouse needs help The Delhi Historical Society has begun a capital campaign to keep open its historic farmhouse and museum on Anderson Ferry Rd.
Built in the last quarter of the 19th century, the farmhouse was home to Mary Witterstaetter and her six children from the 1890s to the 1970s. Developers donated the farmhouse to the Delhi Historical Society in 1991.
After much refurbishment, hard work, and support from the community, the Farmhouse opened as the Delhi Historical Society's museum and headquarters in 1992.
The floorboards on the farmhouse signature wrap-around porch are in need of replacement. About half of the porch floor boards are original to the house. The boiler in the basement dates to the 1960s. Per the manufacturer, the life-span of their boilers is 10-20 years. These projects are estimated to cost $25,000.00.
The farmhouse and Delhi Historical Society are resources to neighboring communities and beyond. Just this year, the world famous Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens brought a group of its horticultural volunteers to the farmhouse to learn about the great floricultural history of Delhi, also known as the Floral Paradise of Ohio.
In addition to the museum on the first floor, the second floor holds a research center where genealogists and historians can investigate the rich history of our communities. Most recently, the New York Times best-seller, "The Ghosts of Eden Park," by author Karen Abbott, was researched in part at Delhi Historical Society.
The mission of the Delhi Historical Society is to discover, preserve, and share the history of Delhi and surrounding areas. While the Society's main focus is on Delhi Township, it also preserves and shares the history of Green Township, Sayler Park, and Price Hill. The heritage and stories of these communities are so intertwined, they are often connected.
The Delhi Historical Society is inviting individuals and businesses to help keep the farmhouse running, so our neighbors and families have a place to learn about their heritage.
You can donate on line at www.DelhiHistoricalSociety.org. Or send an email for more information to info@DelhiHistoricalSociety.org. Stop by any Tuesday, Thursday, or Sunday, between 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m., and visit the museum and research center at 468 Anderson Ferry Rd. You will find out why the Delhi Historical Society is worthy of your support.

DOES HEALTH CARE SEEM LIKE THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL ISSUE?; PAUL FANLUND

Texto completo: Which is it? Are you for or against Medicare for all? Now let's argue for the next hour.
Provoked in part by media questioners, Democrats running for president talk incessantly about health-care politics. It's as if the economy, climate change, firearms, foreign affairs and immigration hardly matter.
Sure, Donald Trump and Republicans want to kill the Affordable Care Act and not replace it even though it has helped insure more than 20 million Americans, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But instead of a focus on the cruelty of the Trump-led GOP or how to improve the ACA, we instead engage in an endless Democratic squabble. And it seems to have become hugely and unwisely outsized in its symbolism.
The New York Times summed it up in a story this summer describing the "ferocious" Democratic intra-party health care fight as "a battle between aspiration and pragmatism, a crystallization of the struggle between the party's left and moderate factions."
If the main goal is to remove Trump in 2020, then Medicare for all and the schism it creates sucking up so much oxygen just seems bonkers.
One assumes U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders sees it as his ticket to differentiating himself in wooing the true-believer extreme left. He likes to yell that "he wrote the damn bill" on Medicare for all.
That has to be music to Republican ears.
The Trump administration supports court action that would invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act. Moderate Democrats who won last fall, and thus helped the party retake the House, took their GOP opponents to task for that anti-ACA position.
Somehow, to some progressives, the fact that Trump wants to push millions off health insurance coverage altogether seems secondary to making a complete makeover of health care a wedge issue within the Democratic Party.
The Medicare for all topic feels ubiquitous, and it reminds me of the email server topic of 2016.
Remember that? A study by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard found that coverage of "scandals" like Hillary Clinton's email server issues got four times as much coverage in major newspapers and on television networks as did Donald Trump's "grab them by ?" harassment of women.
Back then, the resulting narrative among some seemed to be: "Trump is a vile, boorish, lying sexist, but Clinton didn't handle her government email correctly. So it's a push, and I'll stay home."
Now the media seem transfixed by the Democratic knife fight over health care system design, and so that's what the candidates and party leaders talk about. Take the recent debate in Houston as an example.
U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is a smart, low-key centrist from the critical swing state of Minnesota who seems to be getting limited campaign traction because she is, well, a low-key centrist.
But in Houston, she said: "While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill," pointing out how it would move millions off their private health insurance. "And on page eight of the bill it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it.
"I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea," she added.
Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was outspoken in calling for improving the ACA instead of "reinventing the wheel" with Medicare for all.
"God bless" the Democratic presidential candidates putting forth Medicare for all proposals, she told a television interviewer. "But know what that entails."
She added: "I believe the path to 'health care for all' is a path following the lead of the Affordable Care Act. Let's use our energy to have health care for all Americans, and that involves over 150 million families that have it through the private sector."
To top it off, it appears highly uncertain that Medicare for all could be implemented even if Sanders or Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren, another strong advocate, won the presidency.
The House would need to remain in Democratic hands and the Senate is currently 53-47 Republican. The kind of moderate Democratic candidates who would need to win in competitive districts and states to keep or create majorities are unlikely to uniformly support such a radical vision.
Implied in this crusade is condemnation of Barack Obama. Why couldn't he have passed Medicare for all as a newly elected president with all that political capital and momentum?
It's because Obama inhabited the real world. With Pelosi's help, he squeaked through the ACA, providing health coverage for millions and doubtless saving many lives.
I recall David Axelrod, Obama's political strategist, talking about the strain of the hard tradeoffs during his appearance at Cap Times Idea Fest last year. Axelrod described how he wept when the bill passed, recalling how he and his wife almost went bankrupt years before due to the costs of treating their daughter's significant health condition.
In the same vein, there's Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, who has effectively stemmed the Scott Walker politics of division. But has the Democratic governor forced Republicans to accept federal Medicaid funding?
Not yet, but at every opportunity, as he did in my recent interview with him, he points out that in polls Wisconsin citizens overwhelmingly support accepting Medicaid money but that the two Republican legislative leaders refuse to permit a vote.
Oh, he could kick and scream and bicker publicly every day with Republicans, and, I suppose, some progressives would prefer that.
In truth, most pragmatists I know take a back seat to no one in their loathing of Trump, what he is, and what he has done to our country.
They just don't place ideological purity above actual results. CREDIT: By Paul Fanlund

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday he hasn't spoken to his son Hunter Biden about his overseas businesses while forcefully calling again for an investigation into President Donald Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's president.
“I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,” Biden said. “Here’s what I know. Trump should be investigated. ”
“You should be looking at Trump," Biden told reporters in Des Moines shortly after arriving at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual Democratic fundraiser. “He’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum. And he’s using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to smear me . . . Ask the right questions. ”
The comments by the former vice president are the latest in a back-and-forth between Biden and Trump related to Trump's reported discussions with the Ukrainian president, a whistleblower complaint involving Trump, and Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.
Explaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story: What to know about the Trump-Congress standoff over a whistleblower complaint
Multiple news outlets reported this week that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing that community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader.
Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
Hunter Biden, however, told the New Yorker in an interview for an article published in July that he discussed Burisma, the Ukrainian natural gas producer, with his father in December 2015. At the time, Hunter Biden sat on Burisma‘s board of directors.
Around the time of the conversation, Biden was preparing for a trip to the Ukraine and the Obama administration special envoy had raised the issue with the Vice President, according to the article. Hunter Biden told the New Yorker he and his father spoke about Burisma just once.
“‘Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you’re doing,” and I said, ‘I do,’ ” the younger Biden is quoted as saying in the article.
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the reported December 2015 conversation.
Before Biden's comments, Trump fired off several tweets Saturday morning, defending himself and his phone call with Zelensky as a "fine and routine conversation. "
"Nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster," Trump tweeted.
Biden briefly addressed supporters at a pre-steak fry rally Saturday and warned that Trump would try to murky the waters as the election cycle heats up.
“Be prepared for every lousy thing coming from him,” Biden said.
What has happened already
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions about whether Biden, as vice president, pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.

Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"

Texto completo: CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA – Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday accused President Trump of "abhorrent" behavior amid news reports that the president pressured Ukraine's president to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings in the country.
Biden's comments come in the wake of multiple news reports that a whistleblower from the intelligence community filed a complaint with the inspector general overseeing the community concerning a phone call Trump made with a foreign leader. Lawmakers are separately investigating whether Trump pushed for Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Biden's family's dealings in his country.
"If these reports are true, then there is truly no bottom to President Trump’s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country," Biden said in a statement Friday evening. "This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes. It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation — a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia — pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor. "
Asked earlier by reporters after a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, about reports that Trump wanted Biden's son Hunter to be investigated by the Ukrainian government, Biden offered only a brief comment defending his son.
“Whoa, whoa, whoa . . . wait a second. Not one single credible outlet has given credibility to these assertions. Not one single one," Biden said as he left a nature center where he had spoken at a town hall on climate issues. "So I have no comment other than the president should start to be president. ”
Biden added in an interview with the political blog Iowa Starting Line that he found it "concerning to me that a president would do something like that. "
“It’s totally inappropriate for a president to try to get a foreign leader to say something that is untrue about any political opponent,” Biden said in the interview. “I’ve never heard of it before. I’ve never heard of it before. But I think that Congress is looking into it, and I think they should. ”
The president's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has previously raised questions that Biden, as vice president, had pushed for the ouster of former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who had investigated a private Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Group. Hunter Biden was a board member of Burisma.
But Ukraine's current prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.
“Hunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws — at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,” Lutsenko told Bloomberg. “A company can pay however much it wants to its board. ”
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump in a July phone call repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and work with his personal attorney, Giuliani, on the matter.
"At minimum, Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress," Biden said.
Biden has previously said he wanted Shokin out as prosecutor general because he wasn’t doing enough to investigate corruption. The former vice president in March 2016 called on Ukraine’s Parliament to dismiss Shokin, or the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees, according to the New York Times. Shokin was voted out by parliament, but no evidence showing Biden intentionally tried to benefit his son has surfaced.
Still, Trump in a May interview on Fox News suggested Biden engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine's government.
“Look at Joe Biden … he calls them [Ukrainian government leaders] and says, 'Don’t you dare prosecute,'" Trump said in the interview. "'If you don’t fire this prosecutor’ — the prosecutor was after his son — then he said, ‘If you fire the prosecutor, you’ll be OK. And if you don’t fire the prosecutor, we’re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,’ or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?"
Earlier Friday, Trump called reports of the whistleblower complaint against him a “ridiculous story” and said his communications with other leaders were “at the highest level always appropriate. ” Asked by reporters Friday if he had raised questions about Biden's dealings in the Ukraine during a July phone call with Zelensky, Trump replied, “Someone ought to look into Joe Biden. ”
He said it "doesn't matter" if he asked the government of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and that it should be done anyway.
Trump again attacked Biden in a Tweet on Saturday morning. He said his conversation with Zelensky was "perfectly fine and routine. " He added that, "nothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden’s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. "
Sen. Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential contender, called Trump's reported attempts to pressure the Ukrainian president "sober and serious stuff. "
"It should be, in many ways, rocking Washington right now,” Booker said on the sidelines of an LGBTQ campaign forum in Cedar Rapids Friday. “This is not a partisan issue. This is the president engaging in behavior that amounts to, at the very least, serious misconduct. ”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter that Congress' failure to impeach Trump following the release earlier this year of the Mueller report made it “complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. ”
“Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president,” Warren added. “A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won't act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right. ”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call. Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board. The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Did Trump collude with Ukraine to aid his re-election?

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine.
Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for dirt on the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which is engaged in a five-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
Was a meeting with Zelensky or the promise of Ukrainian assistance somehow, by inference or otherwise, made contingent on Kiev investigating Biden? If true, that would be a gross abuse of presidential power.
Trump acknowledged Sunday that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, defending the conversation as appropriate and "perfect." If that's the case, why not make everything public?
The intelligence community's inspector general, Trump appointee Michael Atkinson, was so troubled by the whistleblower's report that he deemed it of "urgent concern."
The law requires that an urgent-concern whistleblower complaint "shall" be turned over to Congress. But the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, blocked this on the grounds that the alleged target of the complaint — presumably Trump himself — is not a member of the intelligence community.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress — not just Democrats but also Republicans who claim to believe in the rule of law — to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Robert Hunter, Grateful Dead Lyricist With a Long, Strange Career, Dies at 78

Texto completo: Mr. Hunter wrote some of the band's signature songs, including "Uncle John's Band," "Scarlet Begonias" and "Dark Star."
Robert Hunter, the primary lyricist on many of the Grateful Dead's most memorable songs, including "Uncle John's Band," "Scarlet Begonias," "Dark Star" and "Truckin'," died on Monday night at his home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 78.
His family announced his death in a statement. His agent, Steve Martin, said Mr. Hunter had recently had surgery.
Mr. Hunter's lyrics, often dreamlike variations on the American folk tradition, meshed seamlessly with the band's casual musical style, helping to define the Grateful Dead as a counterculture touchstone. Interpreting his slippery lyrics became a favorite pastime of the band's most fervent fans, the Deadheads, something he relished.
"I love the fact so many people write their own lives into the songs," he told the newspaper The Independent of East Hampton, N.Y., in 2014. "It's not about what it means, but what sparked it."
Mr. Hunter wrote an oft-quoted lyric in "Truckin"' that could describe his own life pretty well: "What a long, strange trip it's been."
He owed at least some of his songwriting sensibilities to the C.I.A.-sponsored experiments with LSD and other hallucinogens known as MK-Ultra. He was among the volunteer research subjects in the program at Stanford University in 1962, he said, and whatever they were giving him helped his writing process considerably.
"The words jumped from subconscious to the page," he told The Independent.
Mr. Hunter wrote for and with other performers as well, including Bob Dylan. He and Mr. Dylan wrote all but one of the songs on Mr. Dylan's album "Together Through Life," released in 2009.
His work with the Dead, though, remained his signal achievement, one that, he acknowledged, help turn the band into an endearing, enduring musical legend.
"There were other lyricists involved in the writing of the Grateful Dead canon," he wrote in the foreword to "The Complete Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics" (2005; annotations by David Dodd). "Had I not joined, by invitation, as lyricist in residence, a year after they chose the name and nailed down the job through sheer prolixity, the band would have developed differently. It might have been less odd and more popular, for one thing."
Mr. Hunter first met Jerry Garcia, the singer and guitarist who would become the band's most recognizable member, in Palo Alto, Calif., when the two were still teenagers. They found that they shared an interest in music and even played together a bit.
"Our first group was Bob and Jerry, and our first gig was at Stanford," he told Rolling Stone in 2015. "We got $ 5 for both of us. We kept it for a couple of days until we needed cigarettes, and then that was that."
Mr. Garcia, Ron McKernan, Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Bill Kreutzmann formed the Grateful Dead in 1965 (after briefly calling themselves the Warlocks). Mr. Hunter was in New Mexico when he was invited to join the party a year or so later.
"I had written 'St. Stephen' and 'China Cat Sunflower,"' Mr. Hunter said, naming some early songs, "and I sent those -- and 'Alligator' -- off to Jerry, and he uncharacteristically wrote back. He said they were going to use the songs and why didn't I come out and be their lyricist?"
Sometimes he would put lyrics to riffs the band was trying out. He came up with the lyrics for "Uncle John's Band" after listening to a long instrumental tape over and over.
"I think I started out with 'Goddamn, Uncle John's mad,' and like that," he told Rolling Stone, "which turned into 'Uncle John's band.' But it was my feeling about what the Dead was and could be. It was very much a song for us and about us, in the most hopeful sense."
Other times he would present Mr. Garcia with lyrics and hope a song might result. Sometimes it did, sometimes not.
"I would give him a stack of songs and he'd say, 'Oh, God, Hunter! Not again!"' Mr. Hunter said. "He'd throw away what he didn't like. I'd like to have some of the stuff he tossed out."
Mr. Hunter was born Robert Burns on June 23, 1941, in Arroyo Grande, Calif., and took his stepfather's last name. (Details about his early life are sketchy.) He spent his senior year of high school on Long Island but was soon back on the West Coast and in the Stanford experiment.
His participation in what he did not know at the time was a C.I.A. research project is a stranger-than-fiction part of Dead lore.
"He was given LSD, psilocybin and mescaline," Stephen Kinzer, author of the newly published book "Poisoner in Chief: Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA Search for Mind Control," said by email. "Afterward he wrote an ecstatic six-page account of his experiences: 'Sit back picture yourself swooping up a shell of purple with foam crests of crystal drops soft nigh they fall unto the sea of morning creep-very-softly mist."'
"Years later," added Mr. Kinzer, a former correspondent for The New York Times, "he recognized the irony of the C.I.A. project, which was aimed at finding a mind-control drug. 'The United States government was in a way responsible for creating the "acid tests" and the Grateful Dead, and thereby the whole psychedelic counterculture,' he concluded."
Notwithstanding his encounters with drugs, Mr. Hunter took lyric writing seriously. There was, for instance, the matter of rhyming.
"After a few years in the business," he wrote in the foreword to the lyric book, "I developed a rhyming dictionary in my head and didn't even bother to write an end word that would provide a too-limited scope and palette of rhyme. One learns early to tuck the word love into the middle of the line rather than deal with shove, glove, dove, of, and above."
If his lyrics were sometimes hard to make out on records or in performance, that was by design.
"Back in the day," he wrote, "I didn't allow my lyrics to be published with the recordings so people could dub in their own mishearings, adding a bit of themselves to the song. Stone Age recording technique assured a certain amount of verbal blur."
Digitally remastered releases clarified the lyrics, which Mr. Hunter may have regretted.
"I've generally found," he wrote, "that the words to songs I thought I heard in the works of others were more colorful and enigmatically apt than the words I eventually discovered were intended. More to my personal taste. I assume the same is true of my own work."
Mr. Hunter also published several books of poetry. He was a nonperforming member of the Dead, but he did perform solo shows in recent years, accompanying himself on guitar, with plenty of Dead songs in his act.
"There's nothing to compare to that, being up onstage and doing 'Ripple' in front of people who've grown up with that song," he said. "They love it, and I'm able to give it to them as close to the source as you're going to get."
His agent, Mr. Martin, said survivors include Mr. Hunter's wife, Maureen Hunter; three children, Kate, Charlotte and Jess Hunter; and several grandchildren.
In a 2013 interview with Reuters, he recalled his last conversation with Mr. Garcia, who died in 1995. "He said, 'I just wanted to tell you that your songs never stuck in my throat,"' Mr. Hunter said.

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced that the House of Representatives is “moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."
So what happens next?
“Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry. I'm directing our six committees to proceed with their investigation under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry. The president must be held accountable. No one is above the law," Pelosi said.
The Democratic speaker's comments came after meeting with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee and five other committees who have been investigating divisive, controversial Republican President Donald Trump.
In the meeting with the chairmen, Pelosi said the committees, who have been investigating Trump on a wide range of fronts, would put together their best cases on potentially impeachable offenses by the president and send them to the Judiciary Committee, two officials familiar with the conversation told The New York Times.
Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler had already described his panel's inquiry as an impeachment inquiry but until Tuesday had not received the rhetorical backing of Pelosi.
Nadler's committee is investigating along with the Oversight, Ways and Means, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Financial Services committees. Pelosi praised the chairs of all six committees in her remarks.
The Congressional Research Service says an impeachment inquiry is “most often accomplished through the adoption of a simple resolution by the House directing the Judiciary Committee to investigate an official."
During the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, the full House voted for resolutions directing the Judiciary Committee to open the inquiries. But it is not clear whether that step is strictly necessary, the Times reported. The Times also noted that it's also not clear whether one would pass.
Pelosi did not mention a resolution in her remarks.
In the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts, the House Judiciary Committee then held an investigation and recommended articles of impeachment to the full House.
If the Judiciary Committee in this case recommends articles of impeachment to the House and at least one gets a majority vote, the president would be impeached — which is essentially the equivalent of being indicted.
Next, the proceedings would move to the Senate, which would hold a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
If the Senate found Trump committed “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors," he could be removed from office. But the majority of senators are Republicans and they have so far generally been diehard loyalists of the president.
Impeachment has only occurred twice in US history — against Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Neither man was removed from office. President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974 rather than face a House vote on impeachment.

People are still speeding in Providence school zones

LEADING OFF
Happy Tuesday and welcome to Rhode Map, your daily guide to everything happening in the Ocean State. I'm Dan McGowan and my pet goldfish is better than your cat. Follow me on Twitter @DanMcGowan or send tips to Dan.McGowan@globe.com.
Providence issued more than 10,000 school-zone speed camera violations a month during the 2018-19 school year, a sign the controversial program continues to be a moneymaker for the city.
Newly-released figures show the city's 15 speed cameras caught 106,000 drivers traveling at least 11 miles per hour over the speed limit near schools, generating more than $3.1 million from the $50 tickets.
State law requires that speed camera tickets only be issued on days when public schools are in session, and between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. The city is required to issue warning notices during the first 30 days of school, so actual violations won't start this year until October 21.
You can see where all of the cameras are located here.
Providence faced backlash from residents when it launched the speed camera program in January 2018, prompting the General Assembly to reduce the fine from $95 to $50 and prohibit the city from issuing violations on Saturday. The city also agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit related to the cameras last year.
The city has collected more than $5 million in fines since the program was implemented, while payments to the private company that operates the cameras and legal fees related to the lawsuit have topped $2 million.
Mayor Jorge Elorza has not been shy about his support for the cameras, arguing that drivers need to slow down in school zones. He predicted in 2018 that many communities would follow Providence in adopting the program, but only Pawtucket has moved forward.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Elizabeth Warren has climbed up to a virtual tie with Joe Biden in another early state, New Hampshire.
Warren has edged herself to the front of the pack in New Hampshire, where she stands at 27% among registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the state's Democratic primary in February 2020, according to a Monmouth University poll published Tuesday. The Massachusetts Senator is up 19 percentage points from May, where she was at 8%.
Biden is currently at 25%, a 9 percentage point drop from May.
This Monmouth poll follows two other early state polling, Iowa and Nevada, where Warren is also inching ahead or close to Biden to take the lead.
Poll: More good news for Elizabeth Warren, within striking distance of Joe Biden in Nevada
Iowa Poll: Elizabeth Warren leads Register’s Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders
Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement that Warren is looking "stronger with every new poll. "
“She seems to be picking up support across the spectrum with gains coming at the expense of both Biden and Sanders,” he continued.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is at 12% with Democratic and unaffiliated voters who will likely participate in the New Hampshire primary. He is down 6 percentage points from 18% in May. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the only other candidate to stand at double digits at 10%.
More: Here's what to know for National Voter Registration Day
There is a margin of error of plus or minus 4. 9 percentage points. Between Sept. 17 to 21, 664 registered voters were contacted for the poll through telephone, with 401 of those contacted were voters who are likely to vote in the Democratic primary.
Sen. Kamala Harris stands at 3% in the poll. Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are all at 2% in this poll. All other candidates are at 1% or less.
Tulsi qualifies for October debate
By polling at 2%, this is Gabbard's fourth qualifying poll to participate in October's upcoming debate.
Gabbard now the 12th person to qualify for October's debate, which will likely bring debates back to two nights. It was only one night in September. Candidates need to hit 2% in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130,000 individual donors by Oct. 1 to qualify for the October debate, according to the Democratic National Committee guidance.
The next debates will be held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio by CNN and the New York Times. The debates will be held on Oct. 15 and on the 16 if necessary. With 12 candidates, the debates will likely be held on two nights.

A hard time letting go

Texto completo: In 2001, a graphic designer in New Jersey refused to sign a non-compete agreement required by her employer.
The woman's father, an attorney, had advised her not to and the decision cost her the job. Years of litigation followed, with the state Supreme Court ultimately ruling that the company had justly fired her.
The incident is a worst-case scenario of what can happen when parents meddle in their adult children's careers, said John Sarno, president of the nonprofit Employers Association of New Jersey.
Almost 20 years later, parents are asserting themselves to an even greater degree by sitting in on job interviews, filling in job applications, badgering employers to give their children raises and promotions, and — in at least one case — bringing a cake to a child's potential employer, according to a survey by a subsidiary of Robert Half, a global human resource consulting firm.
"Sadly, it's not a new phenomenon," said Dora Onyschak, the New Jersey metro market manager for Robert Half. "Bulldozer parents and helicopter parents are kind of similar in that really they just want what's best for their kid so they want to try and help them to be as successful as possible. But that can sometimes blind them to the fact that maybe they're being too involved or their involvement can be inappropriate or certainly unprofessional when looking for a job."
"Helicopter parenting" became part of American lexicon in the early 2000s to describe the practice of hovering over children and monitoring their every move. The behavior has since evolved into that of bulldozer, snowplow or lawnmower parenting — when parents remove obstacles in their children's lives so they never have to face adversity or failure.
Sarno prefers to call them "advocate parents" and traces their rise to increased diagnoses among children of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, as well as intensified competition to gain admittance to good colleges. Both converge to create anxiety-riddled parents who feel obligated to overly protect their children, he said.
"It's really about a parent who has had this identity, this role as the advocate through the public school, often through college, and they can't give up the role when the young adult starts their career," Sarno said. "I really think it's about parents that can't let go."
Part of that reluctance stems from the 2008 financial crisis and changing social attitudes that have delayed typical markers of adulthood such as marriage and home ownership, said Jacob Goldsmith, director of the emerging adulthood program at Northwestern University's Family Institute. Studies show that unlike more prosperous previous generations, half of children born since 1980 will not out-earn their parents.
"It really scares parents," Goldsmith said. "I think there are a lot of parents looking around and realizing that their kids are not going to make the same money that they did, that their kids are not reaching the milestones they did at the same time and they don't know what to make of that and they really want to be helpful, so they jump in."
Fourteen percent of U.S. adults surveyed this year by Morning Consult for The New York Times said they had pulled strings in their professional networks to secure a job for their 18- to 28-year-old child. About 11% of respondents said they would contact their adult child's employer if the child had an issue at work. Another 16% said they had written all or part of a job or internship application.
Both Goldsmith and Sarno said parental interference in work matters is rare and not unique to millennials, who have been unfairly maligned by some as lazy or entitled.
Most of the parents Goldsmith works with as a therapist exert more subtle control. They will not sit in on job interviews, but they will edit job applications for their children or perform other tasks on their behalf, he said. Instead of teaching, they take action.
"Part of why we as therapists get worried about bulldozer parents is we worry that these kids don't learn the skills they need to do this stuff themselves," Goldsmith said. "I see a lot of emerging adults who struggle to know how to have difficult emotional conversations with their bosses. That's hard, there's no class for that, we often learn that by talking to our parents. But if the parents step in and do it for you, you never learn it."
Children of bulldozer parents often resemble children who have been neglected, he said. Both hit adulthood without a toolkit for dealing with adversity and feel like they have not accomplished anything on their own.
"What I see, and this is a direct result of helicopter parenting, is kids who hit 25 and they've never hit a major roadblock in their life and they are terrified of failure, paralyzed because they feel like life is only successful if you make no mistakes," Goldsmith said. "Kids that were helicopter-parented in many ways look like the kids who never had opportunities... because they're never really doing it themselves."
Most hiring managers are put off by candidates with meddling parents, said Onyschak.
"As an employer, do I then become concerned about the candidate's ability to think independently, do I worry then that they perhaps are not good decision makers?" she said. "It questions their level of independence and maturity and you don't want that to be the reason the person does or does not get the job."
Still, employers like Google, Amazon and LinkedIn have embraced the close relationship between new hires and their parents, launching "Take Your Parents to Work" days to give parents a glimpse of their children's work lives.
Onyschak said she supports parents who provide more hands-off guidance: helping their children practice job interviews, helping them weigh the pros and cons of multiple job offers, looking over cover letters and resumes. But the oversight should stop there, she said.
"We're not hiring the parent, we're hiring the individual, so we want candidates who can think for themselves, who are assertive, who can ask their own questions," Onyschak said.
For parents feeling the urge to become more heavily involved, Goldsmith recommends taking a step back and asking if they are facilitating — or enabling.
"When you've got a parent who's really tuned in and providing good support and facilitating growth, that kid's going to fly to the moon," he said. "But when you have a parent who responds to anxiety by stepping in and trying to run the kid's life — even if it's not as egregious as showing up at a job interview – you still end up with a kid who doesn't really trust the tools they have to be in the world."

Texto completo: PEARL RIVER, N.Y. -- In the summer of 2015, Jaguar Land Rover North America told state officials in New Jersey that it was considering moving to an office development in New York called Blue Hill Plaza.
To keep the automotive giant's headquarters in New Jersey, the state offered $ 26 million in tax credits. So Jaguar stayed.
Five months later, FC USA, a travel company, also told New Jersey that it was looking to relocate to the very same office development in New York.
So did Groupe SEB, an appliance manufacturer.
In total, over five years, 12 companies threatened to leave New Jersey and move to Blue Hill Plaza unless the state provided tens of millions in tax credits.
None followed through on the threat. In fact, an investigation by The New York Times suggests that nearly all of the 12 companies never seriously considered moving to New York.
But all 12 received lucrative tax credits from New Jersey to stay -- more than $ 100 million in total, according to documents obtained by The Times.
Even the leasing agent at Blue Hill Plaza in Pearl River, N.Y., said he realized that the companies were using the site largely to "maximize their incentive packages" from New Jersey.
"We are aware that often times the tenant has no intention at all of relocating to the Blue Hill," said the leasing agent, James B. Tully, an executive vice president at CBRE, a real estate company.
The threats to move to Blue Hill Plaza have emerged as a prominent example of how many companies took advantage of New Jersey's economic incentive programs that in total have awarded $ 11 billion, The Times's investigation found.
That 12 companies all happened to pick the same out-of-state location underscores one of the main criticisms of the programs: The state agency responsible for overseeing the incentives, the Economic Development Authority, carried out little if any oversight. It does not appear that state officials found it suspicious that companies repeatedly threatened to move to the same office complex in New York -- or that the officials even noticed.
Nor did the state officials appear to check whether the companies had sought competing economic development packages from New York, as is typically the case in these cross-state battles over jobs. It turns out that nearly all of the 12 companies did not seek benefits from New York or merely filed cursory applications, The Times found.
The tax credit programs were approved by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, and the Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2013 in an effort to jump start New Jersey's economy after the recession.
But the programs have become embroiled in scandal over revelations that politically connected companies received what amounted to corporate giveaways. Far fewer jobs were retained or created in New Jersey than companies had promised, state officials now acknowledge.
A New York Times investigation in May found that the economic development programs were easily manipulated by lawyers and other insiders.
The controversy over the tax breaks has consumed Trenton, prompting investigative hearings, subpoenas to companies and at least one state agency and setting off open warfare between Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, and legislative leaders of his own party.
Mr. Murphy, who took office in 2018, has assailed the economic development programs, appointing a task force to investigate and overhaul them.
After The Times recently began inquiring about Blue Hill Plaza, New Jersey's attorney general issued another round of subpoenas seeking information from the state agency that administers the incentive programs -- a request that would include information about Blue Hill Plaza.
Mr. Tully, the leasing agent, said many more than the 12 companies identified by The Times sought leases at Blue Hill Plaza in pursuit of tax credits in New Jersey. "We believe the number of companies you cited was a bit light," he said.
Blue Hill Plaza, which consists of a 21-story tower and an 8-story building, is home to a mix of companies and offices, including the North American headquarters of Hunter Douglas, the window blinds manufacturer, and Syncsort, a software company that relocated from New Jersey in 2016.
The complex, located in a town of about 15,000 people that is 30 miles northwest of New York City, would seem to be ideal in making the case for New Jersey tax credits.
It is out of state, even if just barely, and offers leases at a lower rate than many similar high-end buildings in New Jersey.
Most of the 12 companies that The Times identified either declined to comment or would not explain why they had listed Blue Hill Plaza on their applications for credits.
Some of the companies were assisted in the application process by well-connected lobbyists and lawyers. Ted Zangari, a prominent real estate attorney in New Jersey who founded the lobbying group Smart Growth Economic Development Coalition, served as a consultant for two of the 12 companies.
Those companies, Unique Designs and Creative Management Services, were awarded a combined $ 10.3 million in tax credits to stay in New Jersey.
The lobbying group championed the tax credit when it was approved and has defended the program as it has come under scrutiny.
Mr. Zangari did not directly answer questions about his role in the companies' applications but said that, in general, Rockland County is a "natural location" to be considered by businesses in northern New Jersey.
Chris Marx, a senior vice president at Savills, a commercial real estate consulting firm, who identified Blue Hill Plaza for Groupe SEB, the appliance manufacturer, said nothing untoward had happened.
Asked about allegations that these companies never seriously considered moving to Blue Hill Plaza, he said, "I don't think that's true."
"It's the closest to New Jersey, and it's a great complex with a great environment and great amenities," Mr. Marx said.
Tim Lizura, head of the authority in 2015 under Governor Christie, did not respond to requests for comment regarding Blue Hill Plaza.
Mr. Christie has called criticism of the economic development programs "political assassination," saying that the programs saved thousands of jobs in the state.
A spokeswoman for the state Economic Development Authority, Virginia Pellerin, acknowledged this month that the role of Blue Hill Plaza "strengthens the already strong case for adopting Governor Murphy's proposed incentive programs, which prioritize the creation of new jobs over job retention."
The fallout in New Jersey over abuses of its tax credit programs mirrors problems other states have faced in managing economic incentive programs, with budget-strapped agencies often no match for well-heeled lawyers and deep-pocketed corporations.
"Most states just have not invested their resources or the statutory authority, or frankly the political will, to be able to do serious front-end analysis of these kinds of opportunities," said Justin Marlowe, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in public finance management.
Blue Hill was not the only out-of-state building with multiple potential New Jersey tenants.
Three companies said they were going to move to the same warehouse in Orangeburg, N.Y., and ended up getting a total of nearly $ 25 million in tax incentives to stay in New Jersey, according to documents reviewed by The Times. The warehouse is just east of Blue Hill Plaza.
Two other companies, the Michaels Organization and N.F.I., cited the same building in Philadelphia as their potential out-of-state location.
The two companies even expressed concern about the optics of settling on the same building, according to documents uncovered by a state task force.
One top executive wrote in an email, "I think it would be a little suspicious to ask for a duplicate."
The two companies ended up moving to Camden after the state granted them a total of $ 158 million in tax credits.
Three of the 12 companies who threatened to move to Blue Hill Plaza told the state that they could receive millions of dollars in economic incentives from New York if they moved across the border.
But there was little evidence that they seriously pursued the incentives in New York, if at all, the Times found.
One company, the pharmaceutical supplier Lonza AG, said in documents that were reviewed by The Times that it had sought a $ 600,000 "IDA sales tax exemption," referring to the Industrial Development Agency in Rockland County, where Blue Hill Plaza is located.
But Steven Porath, executive director of the agency, said he had never heard of the company.
"I have no record of that company applying to us for anything," Mr. Porath said. "To my recollection, I don't recall ever talking to them."
Jaguar Land Rover North America and FC USA also told the state in their applications they had requested a tax exemption from the county development agency.
Mr. Porath said he remembered talking with Jaguar Land Rover about a potential move to Rockland County but neither company applied for one.
Those same three companies also claimed to have requested another economic incentive through the New York Power Authority, called ReCharge NY, which can reduce energy costs for businesses by up to 25 percent.
But their names are not mentioned on a list of more than 1,700 companies that have submitted a ReCharge NY application.
Lonza AG, an international pharmaceutical supplier, which was awarded $ 3.26 million in tax credits, said, without providing specifics, that it had "informal and preliminary discussions with Empire State Development" in New York about possible economic incentives.
"ESD confirmed its support for the type of project that Lonza was considering, as well as the type and amounts of incentives that would typically be available for such a project," said Sanna Fowler, a company spokeswoman. "Formal applications for New York incentives were not required by ESD or to support the subsequent Grow NJ application."
A spokeswoman at Jaguar Land Rover North America said that its consultant, the real estate services firm JLL, "received a written incentive proposal from ESD" outlining available tax credits and grants in New York. The company did not formally apply for them, she said.
FC USA did not respond to requests for comment.
At Blue Hill Plaza, the notion that New Jersey companies were not serious about moving there appeared to be an open secret.
The leasing agent there, Mr. Tully, said that there was a "low probability of success from this pool of prospects" and that "the decision quite often has already been made before they ever tour the Blue Hill Plaza."

Texto completo: Go local when renaming

I read the approval by Toledo City Council to recommend changing the name of the airport to the Eugene F. Kranz Toledo Express Airport.

When it comes to recognizing individuals by naming buildings, facilities, etc., after them, consideration should be given to how they really contributed to Toledo and/or Lucas County and its residents.

One case in point would be a retired teacher who taught in the classroom for 50 years in the Toledo Public school district at Chase and Cherry elementary schools. Ms. Lorraine Kwiatkowski lived in Toledo, attended Woodward High School, and after graduation from college dedicated her teaching career to the more than 1,200 children she taught.

Many have gone on to give back to Toledo or other communities because of her teaching. A born-and-raised Toledo resident, she lived and worked her entire life in the Toledo Polish district she loved.

Are we forgetting about others like her? Time to rethink the naming process.

Justice maligned

Once again, this time in the New York Times, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has been maligned with a lie.

They reported that a witness saw the judge expose himself at a college party years ago. This witness is a lawyer who worked on the Bill Clinton impeachment defense team.

The so-called victim has no recollection of it ever happening. The story cannot be corroborated, yet the newspaper decided to run it. It has since revised the story.

Some Democrats running for president said he should be impeached. Because he is conservative and could likely vote eventually to overturn Roe vs. Wade, they would love to get him off the court.

The same goes for the potential impeachment farce that President Trump is facing from the Democrats. They know he will continue to appoint conservative judges when given the chance.

The abortion industry makes millions of dollars killing unborn children in the womb. Make no mistake about it, this is the root reason for the angst. What else could it possibly be?

Chicago carnage

There is a letter in the Readers' Forum clamoring for more gun control following any shooting that happens.

Where is the outrage when on a daily basis dozens of people are shot and killed in Chicago, which is the gun control poster boy of the Democrats? You would think they would be appalled by the senseless loss of life in their example of gun control utopia as every person with any compassion or common sense is.

Evil, nefarious people will find a way to buy weapons no matter what laws are in place. Stop blaming the tool and start blaming the operator, because without a human hand and criminal intent a gun will just stay dormant and injure or kill no one.

I guess that's why common sense is so out of style today. It's more politically correct to bluster and posture than to provide solutions. As for myself I would never travel to Chicago for any reason until the talking heads and politicians actually do their elected jobs and provide a real solution.

Texto completo: Presidents these days always seem to get worse, don’t they?
To many on the left, Donald Trump is an order of magnitude more disastrous a commander in chief than was George W. Bush, whose reputation now stands thoroughly rehabilitated in the popular culture.
Bush is no longer the incurious man who launched an unnecessary war that killed hundreds of thousands in Iraq; today, he’s the goofy old fella who paints portraits of the troops, pals around with Michelle Obama and seems to be in on the joke of our times.
“Sorta makes me look pretty good, doesn’t it?” Bush has been reported to smirk about the Trump era.
For the record, I think the jury is still out on whether Trump is worse than Bush. But for most of 2019, I’ve been trying to picture a future that elevates Trump in the same way it did Bush: How much worse could all this get? And worse in what direction — what politics, policies, rhetoric and media mastery will the next extremely terrible president marshal to ruin America anew?
In short: What sort of character do we have to imagine occupying the White House in 2029 to make lefties like myself feel even a slight pang of nostalgia for the good old days of Donald Trump?
The thought experiment is instructive because it compels us to ponder some of the fundamental forces shaping American culture and politics at the moment. It is also horrifying, because what quickly becomes evident is that we might now be only in the middle of everything spinning out of control.
Come, take a stroll with me through my recurrent nightmare: It’s the sweltering summer of 2029, and the man in charge is Tucker Carlson — that is, President Tucker Carlson, the one-time Fox News talker turned righteous, white nationalist economic populist, now in his triumphant second term, after having defeated the incumbent Joseph “Recession Joe” Biden back in 2024.
Like Trump, Carlson spends his first term refashioning America along racial lines. But unlike Trump, whose one term is now regarded by much of the right as a best-forgotten political disaster, Carlson advances an ethnonationalist populism that succeeds in a wild, frightening fashion. His secret: competence, a commitment to true political realignment, and a brutal online political machine that represents the full flowering of the tactics and ideology first displayed during 2014’s Gamergate movement.
Where Trump was a chaotic, undisciplined narcissist, the Carlson who wins in 2024 is a canny political strategist who makes good on Trump’s forgotten promise to embrace anti-corporate economic policies. On paper, parts of Carlson’s agenda seem ripped from former liberal firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren (now in exile in Toronto): His chief enemies are Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft, megacorporations owned and staffed by wealthy liberals.
It’s a winning electoral formula: A large minority of Americans are willing to forgive Carlson’s authoritarian, nativist impulses if they see it as part of a war against out-of-touch, culture-destroying corporations that are automating our jobs; killing every other industry; and exercising complete control over what we watch, read, listen to, buy and believe. And in America, thanks to the Electoral College, winning over a large minority is good enough to regularly win the presidency.
Obviously I am making all of this up. But my premonition is based on months of research — this is what you might call an educated nightmare. My education: Carlson’s own nightly Fox News show, which I’ve been watching obsessively since January. I began tuning in because Carlson — who, with nearly 3 million viewers a night, is the second most popular host on cable, after Sean Hannity — has become one of the most fascinatingly terrifying men in conservative media.
There are two things that terrify and fascinate me about Carlson. First, unlike most Republican lawmakers today, Carlson is sketching an economic vision of a post-Trump America that departs in key ways from Trumpism, especially in its muscular anti-corporate, populist zeal.
In January, in a commentary that went viral on the right, Carlson excoriated American political leaders for their commitment to empty capitalism: “For our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer,” he said. “They teach us it’s more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.”
He regularly criticizes tech giants, whom he argues are censoring his and his followers’ views. But he also hates corporations more generally for what he calls their attempts to influence culture and politics (including by boycotting his show): His critics, he said in May, “believe democracy is when a tiny group of rich people imposes its values on everyone else by force."
In June, Carlson praised Warren’s plan for “economic patriotism”: “Many of Warren’s policy prescriptions make obvious sense,” he said, wondering why Republicans, including Trump, didn’t join her vision. “What if the Republican leadership here in Washington had bothered to learn the lessons of the 2016 election?”
The second thing that scares me about Carlson is his racism, which is both more extreme and more cannily packaged for a digital audience than is Trump’s.
While Trump is a creature of cable television, Carlson’s segments look like extended YouTube clips, and they’re designed to play to an audience that is extremely online. His critics and white supremacists themselves point out that, more than anyone else on television, Carlson functions as a kind of laundromat for white identity movements: Several times a week, he’ll lift ideas, storylines and troll-based narratives directly from the fetid swamp of online hatred. Then he’ll clean these theories up and wrap them in a bow for his mainstream audience, usually to advance an overarching idea that he mentions constantly: that, thanks to an “invasion” of immigrants, white people in America and Europe face economic and cultural calamity, and that the political, corporate and media establishments are abetting their destruction.
“No one covers white identity more consistently than Tucker,” said Madeline Peltz, who watches Carlson’s show every night as a researcher for Media Matters for America, a liberal advocacy group that tracks conservative outlets. “I cannot remember a single episode in the last two years that didn’t include these ideas.”
I’d known all this before I started watching, but actually watching blew my mind: Carlson’s propaganda was so constant, and the sleight of hand with which he inserted barely sanitized racist theories into his broadcast so swift, that I began to see the outlines of my nightmare — that Trump was only a prelude, and that even if he loses next year, someone far more sophisticated than our current president could come along to push digitally mediated politics in an even darker direction.
Carlson — who talks often with Trump, and was reportedly instrumental in advising Trump against attacking Iran in June — recently disclaimed any interest in running for president. He has been a nimble shape-shifter over the course of his career (a decade ago, he was a libertarian), so it’s possible that his latest critiques of capitalism are just an act.
But he may also have noticed that there are lots of conservative voters in America who don’t care for the Republican Party’s giveaways to corporations. Hence the outlines of a political vision: Carlson is aiming to mix a lefty-sounding economic agenda with a white nationalist-inspired cultural agenda — and to muddy the marriage by arguing that his and his followers’ ideas are being stifled by the tech giants that he’s fighting.
This is Carlson’s entire shtick. He uses the cover of capitalist hardship to advance theories of white oppression, often while summoning further harassment of his critics. He’s taking it to television, five nights a week. And where it ends up could be hellish.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump reconoció este domingo en el jardín sur de la Casa Blanca que en su conversación el 25 de julio con el recién elegido presidente de Ucrania, Vladimir Zelensky, habló sobre uno de sus principales competidores electorales, Joe Biden .
Esta afirmación llega después de que se acusara al mandatario estadounidense de forzar a su homónimo ucraniano para que investigara a Biden y a su hijo, Hunter Biden , por las actividades empresariales de este último en su país.
“La conversación que tuve fue en gran medida de felicitación”, dijo el presidente a los reporteros. “ No queremos que nuestra gente, como el vicepresidente Biden y su hijo, generen corrupción en Ucrania . Ucrania tiene ya muchos problemas”, añadió Trump antes de trasladar las intenciones de Zelensky de deshacerse de la corrupción en su país.

El viernes, el presidente había dicho que “no importaba” lo que había hablado con el ucraniano pero, después de que este domingo New York Times, Washington Post y World Street Journal revelaran nuevos detalles, salió al paso con el cambio estrategia discursiva. Hay quien especula con la idea de que Donald Trump detuvo la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que Zelensky accedió investigar al candidato presidencial demócrata, algo que el presidente negó tajantemente este domingo.
Los demócratas han exigido al presidente que publique la grabación de la llamada para demostrar que no tiene nada que ocultar. El senador demócrata por Connecticut, Chris Murphy dijo que si se confirma que Trump solicitó ayuda extranjera para interferir en su carrera a la reelección, habría traspasado los límites. Por su parte, Biden dijo ayer que el republicano había “abusado de su poder” presidencial.

Impeach Kavanaugh? Go for it!

Texto completo: The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had the New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, then most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment. "These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama housing secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former vice president Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh before. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were "like an adrenaline shot" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real." "We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'" Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said "no."
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices. In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could "restructure" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-to-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

This is the inspiration we all need right now

Texto completo: It wasn't an R or a D moment. It had nothing to with a political party.
It was about a promise to a daughter, one who as a little girl would hold my hand and look up to me and tell stories and ask questions and generally melt my heart with her smile.
"You can be anything you want," I told Jazzy, as we walked around a college campus together one evening after work. She was probably 6 or 7. She doesn't like to be called that now. Jazz is her preference now, which is about as perfect a name as you can have when you share a hometown with Charlie Parker.
Those words said to her so long ago felt a lot more real on a night a few summers back as we watched Hillary Clinton become the first female major party nominee for president of the United States. Our excitement wasn't about the Democrats' candidate. The party mattered the least. It wasn't even about the person.
It was about something so much bigger.
What mattered was that others believed a woman could and should run the most powerful country in the world. It now was about so much more than a father's promise to a little girl. It felt like the world actually changed that night for the better.
The next morning as we looked at how the nation's newspapers covered this historical news, which is what you do when your dad is a newspaper editor, it was clear there was more work to do than we thought the night before. Across the country, newspapers illustrated this incredible news by showing a photo of former President Bill Clinton making the announcement at the Democratic Convention.
Not the woman who had been nominated.
I hadn't raised Jazzy to believe she could be president only if her husband was elected first. My heart sank.
That moment resonated again as The Spokesman- Review newsroom began its strategic planning for 2019 almost 12 months ago. With 2019 and 2020 marking the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage in our nation, we wanted to make sure this newspaper was a powerful voice in helping our community understand that more work needs to be done.
We would spend September celebrating the most inspirational women in Eastern Washington and North Idaho. Lots of organizations do this and do it well. We were going to do it differently. We were going to focus on amazing women who are often overlooked.
I'm a huge fan of Spokane astronaut Anne McClain, the youngest ever on NASA's roster. I wouldn't think of missing "American Ninja Warrior" when Sandy Zimmerman is out on that crazy obstacle course kicking everyone's backside, becoming the first mother to compete in the nationally televised contest. Justifiably, Gonzaga basketball coach Lisa Fortier is quickly gaining the recognition she deserves for being one of the best coaches in the nation, regardless of which locker room her players walk into.
Of course these women should be on any list of the most important women in our region. Because they are.
Which is why we wanted our list to be different.
We would let our readers nominate all of the recipients and we'd focus on those who rarely, if ever, have the spotlight on them ... yet it's impossible to think of our community being what it is without these women.
The stories about unsung heroes and the underdogs would no longer go unwritten.
For the past 10 days, our front page told these stories. Today's paper not only republishes those front-pages stories, it also tells the stories of five legendary Washington women whose lives have been spent in splendid dedication to making our community better each day.
Our mission became even clearer as we read all of the nominations our readers sent us. We decided to run them all. The light needed to shine on every woman nominated. Their stories were all so good. That's what you'll also find in today's very special section about The Spokesman- Review's "Inland Northwest Women of the Year."
After you've read all of the front-page news and sports stories in today's paper, make sure to set aside an hour or two to take in all of their inspirational stories of achievement, ingenuity and spirit in that section. You'll be as moved as we were as we put it together over the past several weeks.
We also need to let you in on a little secret: celebrating women has been our goal for a lot more than just the past few weeks. Yes, that's part of the reason why you saw us amp our coverage of the Gonzaga women's basketball team last year, but it was about a whole lot more than Title IX.
We've worked hard to turn our newspaper into something unique in our industry. We try to zero in on things that unite us as a community and celebrate the heroes and moments that have the power to show us that we have more in common than we have differences.
A huge part of our mission is an unconventional community-engagement strategy. We started Northwest Passages - a book club and community discussion series that often brings upwards of 700 people together. Yes, we talk about books, but it's much more about getting together to talk about important ideas and issues.
It's really about talking about our community and bringing us together for something greater.
Our events make our journalism experiential, showing the important role local journalists play in democracy at all levels ... and how our community can help support this important work. Northwest Passages gets our readers involved at such levels that we now literally have "community-funded" newsroom positions funded directly by these events and by the people who attend them.
Over the past 18 months, Northwest Passages has hosted some of the most successful and important authors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the nation. We've had powerful discussions that encouraged thoughtful and positive engagement about difficult topics - a sharp contrast to the divisive dialogue that seems to be our nation's new norm.
And if you've been paying attention to who we've brought to Spokane over the past year, you'd notice the vast majority of our speakers have been women.
We brought in Tara Westover, the New York Times best-selling author of "Educated" - which eventually became one of the top-selling and most talked-about books of 2018. Anita Lo, the first woman to win "Iron Chef America," visited Northwest Passages to talk about what it meant when she beat Mario Batali for the title. Lo also is the first female executive chef to prepare an official state dinner at the White House. Nicole Chung, whose book about the struggles of adopted children was named national book of the year by many organizations, was here in the spring. We hosted the Washington premiere of "A Fine Line" - an independently produced film by Joanna James about why women represent only 3% of the executive chefs in the world.
Over the several months, they were joined by Nancy Pearl, Pam Houston, Mareya Ibrahim, Ana Warner, Sharma Shields and Laurel Randolph. That's not the full roster of our speakers, but you get the idea.
We're going to do it again and even bigger a little later this year.
On Nov. 14, we're going to throw a huge party at the Bing to celebrate the 15 women featured in today's "Women of the Year" section. You're all invited.
Helping us with this celebration will be two of the most inspirational women I've ever met: Karen Wickre and Tess Vigeland.
Wickre has been one of the highest-ranking women at both Google and Twitter. Now she's a best-selling author. Vigeland's voice is instantly familiar to anyone who listens to NPR. She was the longtime anchor for public radio's "Marketplace." Then she walked away from it all and wrote a book about making that "Leap." (She still fills in for "All Things Considered" from time to time.)
Just like the women we're celebrating, Vigeland and Wickre represent something even bigger and more important: Successful women who have solved problems, made difficult decisions and overcome obstacles that half of our population can never truly understand ... myself included.
These women never hit the glass ceiling. They created their own way around it, finding success on their own terms.
That's what the words to my daughter meant. Be whatever your heart tells you matters the most. And know that you can.
Which is why this father of a daughter will keep reminding others that gender doesn't matter. And if you don't believe me, then just go read today's special section and you will.

Texto completo: One summer night in 1986, 7-month-old Christopher Abeyta vanished from his crib at the foot of his parents' bed.
After grabbing books from his locker at Cedaredge High School on Colorado's Western Slope in 1981, 17-year-old Roger Ellison was never seen again.
Beth Miller — a lively 14-year-old who "didn't know a stranger" — set off from her Idaho Springs home on a jog one August day in 1983. She never came home.
With the recent discovery of 12-year-old Jonelle Matthews' remains 34 years after she went missing from her Greeley home, we took a look at years-old missing children cases that have puzzled Colorado authorities.
There are 59 missing juveniles listed in the Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold case database, according to the CBI. Here are eight of those children who vanished, seemingly, without a trace in Colorado.
1. Chris Vigil Missing since: April 30, 1978
Chris Vigil, a 9-year-old boy from Laporte, was last seen on a Sunday afternoon hike with his mom, Marian, and younger brother, Eric, in Northern Colorado's Poudre Canyon. The three set off together on the Greyrock Mountain trail on April 30, 1978, but Chris ended up hiking ahead and disappearing. Despite one of the "most expansive" searches in Larimer County history, Chris has never been found. If you have any information about the disappearance or whereabouts of Chris, contact the Larimer County Sheriff's Office at 970-416-1985.
2. Marie Blee Missing since: Nov. 22, 1979
On Nov. 22,1979, after attending a 4-H Club dance in Craig, 15-year-old Marie Blee went to a party at the nearby Shadow Mountain Village mobile home park with a friend, according to the Charley Project. Blee left the party with an unidentified driver who had agreed to take her back to her home 15 miles away in Hayden. She has never been heard from again. If you have any information on Blee's disappearance, contact the Routt County Sheriff's Office at 970-879-1090.
3. Roger Ellison Missing since: Feb. 10, 1981
It's been almost 40 years since 17-year-old Roger Ellison, a popular A-student with seemingly no reason to disappear, vanished from his Western Slope high school. Ellison was last seen getting his books from his school locker in the small Delta County town of Cedaredge. He never made it to his next class and never came home that day, according to the Denver Post. Despite posters being distributed — and his family offering an $8,000 reward for information — Ellison has never been found. For months after Roger's disappearance, his father, Ernest, reportedly stood at a curb waiting for the school bus that once dropped off his son. He would scan the students getting off, hang his head and cry when he didn't see Roger, according to the Post. Ernest died of a heart attack the spring after Roger's disappearance. If you have any information on Roger's disappearance, contact the Delta County Sheriff's Office at 970-874-2000.
4. Victoria Sanchez and 5. Yvonne Mestas Missing since: Nov. 1, 1982
Victoria Sanchez and Yvonne Mestas, both 15 and students at Rocky Ford High School, were last seen at the school on Nov. 1, 1982. Their disappearances have stretched on decades, but new information in the case led the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and Rocky Ford police to reopen the case in 2017. It currently remains unsolved. If you have information on Yvonne's or Victoria's disappearances, contact the Rocky Ford Police Department at 719-254-3345.
6. Beth Miller Missing since: Aug. 16, 1983
On Aug. 16, 1983, 14-year-old Beth Miller went for a morning jog in her hometown of Idaho Springs, just west of Denver. She never came home and hasn't been seen since. Witnesses claimed to have seen Miller talking to a man in a red pickup truck, but the alleged truck was never found by law enforcement, according to 9News. If you have information on Beth's disappearance, contact the Colorado Bureau of Investigation at 303-239-4221.
7. Christopher Harvey Missing since: July 11, 1984
After visiting a friend in the Hinsdale County mobile home park where his family spent their summers, 14-year-old Christopher Harvey set off to walk his dog. Though the dog returned, Christopher never did. The teen's disappearance — which was further muddled when a badly-beaten boy around the same age was incorrectly identified as Christopher six weeks later — was chronicled in a November 1984 story in the New York Times. If you have any information on his disappearance, contact the Hinsdale County Sheriff's Office at 970-944-2291.
8. Christopher Abeyta Missing since: July 15, 1986
Christopher Abeyta was just seven months old when he vanished from his crib at the foot of his parents' bed in Colorado Springs.
Though more than 30 years have passed, the Abeyta family has actively searched for Christopher ever since.
Before her death of cancer in 2017, Christopher's mother, Bernice, traveled across the county chasing down tips about his whereabouts.
Last year, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released an updated, age-progressed rendering of what Christopher could look like today.

Texto completo: New Yorkers, we live on top of one another, so it's only natural that sometimes we spill out onto the concrete. It happens especially during the sweltering summer spells, when even the apartment walls seem to sweat.
There are very few backyards in the city, so to avoid walking up flights, a steamy basement or balmy bedrooms, we hug the block.
Across all five boroughs New Yorkers set out on their streets with lawn chairs, pools, bouncy castles and tables full of food, to enjoy the summer together. Throughout the day there is a cacophony of familiar music, the laughter of children playing and the sizzling sound of meat on a grill. No cars are allowed.
According to a New York Times article from 1923, this tradition of gathering on stoops and visiting with neighbors goes back as far as the 1860s. By the middle of the 20th century, the custom had blossomed into a full-on celebration.
This is the New York City block party.
The thing is, come out, give love to your neighbor. Everyone you meet, give love, let them know who you are.
-- Leroy Williams, Jefferson Avenue
The openness of the block, the freedom of doing your own thing is what is special about this. This tradition may be changing our New York, but not in this neighborhood.
-- Julie Mancini, East 35th Street
Even though the block party has a long history in New York, the city didn't begin keeping records until 1999. This year there were 1,311 permitted block parties in New York City between June 1 and Sept. 1. The majority were in Brooklyn, which had 721 parties this year, more than the other boroughs combined.
The tradition has at times been marred by violence: In July there was a shooting at a block party in Brownsville that left 11 people injured.
Mostly, they are moments for a neighborhood to come together. Many streets use it as an opportunity for outreach: Health clinics set up tables, church leaders give sermons and neighbors converse and feed one another.
"I just want the community to know that those things are not going to stop us from serving the community or from helping your neighbor or reaching out to your neighbor," said Pastor Vanessa Rodriguez, who attended a block party in Harlem hosted by the Friendly Hands Ministry.
One of the things I love about New York City is the fact that you don't have to be from here to belong in the city because it's a city of transplants. So, you come to the city and you find your family here.
-- Olanna Goudeau, 19th Annual 132nd Street Praise Jam
I grew up in Harlem on 132nd Street. That was my block. The people that lived in my building were my extended family. And as a child who was born in the summer, my birthday parties were usually block parties.
There was the ice cream cake my mother kept in our freezer until it was the perfect time to bring it downstairs. The neighbor from one of the floors closest to the street who would play music loud enough that it would pour out onto the concrete stoop.
The food, as diverse as the people cooking it, took on a life of its own: from filet mignon that fell off a truck to BBQ ribs, elote, burgers, frio frios, Icees, whatever was in the pot your neighbor brought down straight from their stove.
My friends and I would skateboard, ride our bikes up and down the street and sometimes, if you could get us to stay in one place, we'd show off our dance moves for our parents and neighbors.
But the best part of the block party was when we saw someone pull out that massive wrench to open up the fire hydrant. We let the ice-cold water splash solace onto our sweaty skin.
Most important, all of my friends were already there.
Before the previous block party people didn't communicate. People was judgmental of each other. After the first one we became one big family.
-- Paul Padarat, 102nd Avenue and Remington Street
This block is looking out for each other, and it's amazing to watch each generation grow up. There's nowhere else like this neighborhood, where else can you hear Caribbean and West Indian music playing out in the streets like this?
-- Elizabeth Harrinarine, 108th Street Annual Block Party
At block parties across the city you can find people of all ages, from all over the world, who somehow ended up being New Yorkers from the same block. A celebration of those faux familial ties we make as city dwellers. We celebrate one another's birthdays, making rent, a release from prison, a return from military service, a marriage, a baby shower, a graduation, a new job.
Permitted or not, the block can hold enough joy for any occasion.
"Everyone knows each other, everyone looks out for each other. Everyone helped with the signs, collecting money, the permits. It's a lot of deep friendship built in this neighborhood," said Julie Mancini, at a block party in Marine Park, Brooklyn.
In 1923, The New York Times called the block party a "jollification," and a "social phenomenon." Though there are reports of earlier versions of street-based gatherings, the block party as we know it today began when New Yorkers held celebrations for soldiers coming back from World War I.
"To some degree," the author said, "it was organized to fill a purpose, then the idea caught on and the block party as an institution became more spontaneous."
By the 1980s, the spontaneity of block parties had made them fertile ground for rap and hip-hop to bloom. D.J.s would plug their turntables into streetlight outlets. A crowd would form and the M.C. -- the rapper -- would spit livewire rhymes. Live music performances, and the dancing that came with them, became an integral part of the event.
"I'm a D.J., and I love getting the crowd going," said Adrian Lucas, who D.J.s her block's annual party in Harlem. "It's even more fun to see the people I know happy and excited because of the music."
Today is truly for the community and by the community, that's something that we really embrace and that's our mission.
-- Emanuel Bloomfield-Jones, 2nd Annual Back to School Bash
For some, however, the idea of a block party is a New York City relic.
"I think they are dying," Elander Williams said at a block party in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "We have very little participation. The kids are growing up and the new generation are not interested in having block parties."
In the last 10 years the number of permits the city has issued for block parties has been steadily decreasing. There were 537 fewer permitted block parties this year between June 1 and Sept. 1, than in 2009, when 1,848 permits were issued during that same period. That could be because more people are having block parties without the city's permission or because fewer blocks are throwing them.
"Every year it has come to less and less," said Patrick Welch, who went to a block party in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where he has lived his whole life. "Block parties will continue, but those who move on the block must embrace the culture. But, they do not. They pass by you and to them you don't exist. So how can you have a block party after that?"
Maybe fretting over whether block parties are dying, however, is also part of the tradition. In the article from 1923, the author lamented, "What has become of the block parties? It is midsummer and you may search the town from end to end and find scarcely one."
That's how you know you're on the right block. When your neighbors come to help you and you don't even have to ask. And that's the way this neighborhood is.
-- Bob Bieder, Glebe Avenue Block Party
A lot of new folks just moved here from all over the world, right in this one block, so when we have block parties like this we try to bring everybody together.
-- Walter Relaford, Grant Avenue Block Party
Some New Yorkers find it difficult to foster a sense of community with new faces on the block every year, but no matter how new you are, a block party can be an opportunity for New Yorkers to come down from their towers and meet one another.
"I was feeling kind of iffy when the neighborhood started to become gentrified and different colors started to move in," said Duron Johnson, who was attending a party on his block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. "But when I came to the block party today, I'm looking at Asian kids, black kids, Caucasian kids, and they are playing together, and I feel like right now it's a good time, and it's going to be a bright future for block parties."
For me the block party remains a charming part of my life and an intrinsic part of a proper New York City upbringing. Those summer days are a still life in my memory: Getting soaked by the icy water shooting out of the fire hydrant. My mother sitting on the stoop with our neighbors, in her linen blouse, laughing at a joke she was telling. My brother and his friends running past me, probably heading to Cristian's to buy candy.
New York City loses an integral part of itself without the block party, but I am sure it isn't going anywhere. When the humidity and temperatures are high and New Yorkers have only got one another, there's no better place to go than the block.

Methodology
We used NYC Open Data to find the time and place of all permits for block parties in New York City. After mapping the locations for the permits filed for this summer, we sent 20 photographers out across the five boroughs over three weekends in August. They filed from a total of 65 block parties.
Our historical data went back 10 years, and we narrowed those numbers to look only at block parties held between June 1 and Sept. 1 of each year.

Texto completo: As you read this, I’m away on vacation — unless you’re one of those people who let their newspapers stack up, that is. In that case, I might already be back. For the rest of you, look for me again Oct. 2.
Speaking of papers, many of you offered comments online and via email on my Sept. 1 column on the cessation of newspaper sales at Starbucks.
Not surprisingly, many of you enjoy newspapers, especially the printed version.
“I still get the local paper and read it every day. Online isn’t the same,” said Leah Leander Fuller.
“I like an actual paper copy! Especially because I love doing the New York Times crossword puzzle,” Rose Davidson said. “Just no fun to look at it online.”
“I still like spreading the physical newspaper out on my kitchen counter, double pager. It is my solace before a hectic day,” Laura Turnbull shared.
“I just do not want to depend on internet news. I will mourn the day when print dies,” said John Kolody.
“I like a physical newspaper also. Currently get the New York and LA Times along with the Daily Bulletin of course,” says John Fatini. (I like his “of course.”) Fatini continues: “After finishing I take all three to the Chino Senior Center where they are appreciated seven days a week.”
Now that’s an interesting idea. You could drop off your newspaper to a senior center or other place where people might like it. That is, if you haven’t already completed the crossword. They hate that.
Often I leave my morning Daily Bulletin behind at a bakery or coffeehouse if I’m out. Someone might pick it up and be intrigued.
My colleague Ryan Hagen was at a car dealership in San Bernardino the other day when he spotted a copy of that morning’s Sun. The sight “inspired a mother in the waiting room to explain to her roughly 5-year-old daughter what a newspaper is,” Hagen said. “The daughter seems like a fan!”
Get ’em while they’re young.
It’s not just Starbucks that isn’t carrying newspapers anymore, or Barnes & Noble, which stopped a year or so ago. “My Bristol Farms, and I suspect of all them, no longer stock papers,” wrote retired newsman Van Gordon Sauter.
Susan Strother Carrier said she may fight back against the Starbucks decision in her own way.
“I have the Sunday NY Times delivered. When I’m finished reading it,” she said, “I think I’ll start dropping it off at my local Pomona Starbucks.” That’s the spirit.
Karen Karlsson puts a digital spin on the whole thing: “I read my digital subscription to the NY Times (and the IV Daily Bulletin) on my laptop in Starbucks!” Hey, Starbucks has free wifi, so why not?
Let me add, I’m agnostic on print versus digital, enjoying both. Basically I just want to stay employed. Get whichever one appeals to you.
“I miss reading a physical copy of the newspaper, but I am, as of today, the proud owner of an IVDB online subscription!” Judi Holsten Guizado said a couple of weeks back. I hope it will serve her in good stead.
“While physical newspaper sales are diminishing quickly, there will always be a need and desire for great content and stories,” says Joshua Swodeck, who supports us online.
In fact, when someone groused to him recently about how we at the Bulletin have the nerve to want people to pay for our product, Swodeck pulled out a dollar bill — our trial subscriptions online are 99 cents for 13 weeks — and offered it up. (It wasn’t accepted.)
Some ex-readers are disaffected by a perceived political bias in their former newspaper of choice. Randie Kreutzer canceled the L.A. Times after 30 years but said: “I really miss reading the news in print and I do get the San Gabriel Valley Tribune delivered on Sunday as a concession to my need to stay informed. Otherwise, you can count me as one reader who doesn’t miss buying a paper.”
Regarding my quest for a New York Times, newspaper carrier Ray Bernal suggested home delivery of the Times or the Post. He added that “throwing one of those NYT Sunday editions” is “like a shot put.”
I could subscribe, but I already read four papers, including my own, and don’t have the time or dough for a daily Big Apple paper too. Plus, I can read the Times at a library if I need to, albeit not over a beverage.
When the paper became unavailable at Starbucks, though, I did get a sudden craving for what was out of reach. As I wrote here, I found a nearly week-old NYT Sunday edition at Ontario’s Newsboy Books and ponied up $6 plus tax, figuring there would still be plenty of interest. And there was.
I read how “Sesame Street” has used music in its 50 years, with the singer-songwriter Leslie Feist talking about how her “1234” song became her signature tune after the show used it. I read an interview with actor Tom Hiddleston and articles about use of the term “gaslighting” and about the history of nighttime tennis in the U.S. Open. I chuckled at learning the term “hicksters,” which refers to hipsters who live in the sticks.
Two weeks after I bought the paper, I finished it off last weekend by reading its magazine profile of Neil Young. I would say I more than got my $6 worth.
The Starbucks move seemed to have a ripple effect on the NYT’s local availability. Newsboy co-owner Jack Gingold called distribution “problematic” but said the store, which is closed Sundays, gets the Sunday bulldog edition by 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
I’ll have to pick up one again. Or see if Susan Carrier has left it behind at a Pomona Starbucks.

'Are we going to do it again?': Bill Maher warns Democrats against attacks on Brett Kavanaugh

Texto completo: Bill Maher criticized Democrats for resurfacing unsubstantiated sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and calling for the judge's impeachment.
Maher, the host of Real Time with Bill Maher, used his Friday night show to attack Democratic strategy and warned of the "Kavanaugh effect" that possibly cost multiple swing-state Democratic senators their seats in 2018.
"In the 2018 election, it looks like Democrats could’ve won Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri, and West Virginia. All five were home to Democratic senators running for election in tight races. Joe Manchin, the only one that voted for Kavanaugh, won. The other four lost," Maher said, describing the "Kavanaugh effect."
"They have polling on this. People did not like going after a guy for what he did in high school. It looked bad, and now Democrats are talking about impeaching him again?" Maher asked his panel.
NBC analyst Heather McGhee defended Democratic attacks on Kavanaugh, asserting that the allegations against Kavanaugh are relevant to his Supreme Court position as a "moral arbiter."
"Yes, it was about something a long time ago, but it goes to character. We are not talking about a job like we have. We are talking about being one of the nine moral arbiters of this great nation," McGhee said.
Maher called Kavanaugh a "creep" but maintained that Democratic attacks on the judge are mistakes and that people’s actions from high school should not burden them for the rest of their lives.
"We don't have the votes [to impeach him.] And now we lost seats. Are we going to do it again?" Maher asked. "Ruth Bader Ginsburg said glowing things about him. I think he’s an asshole. I think he shouldn’t be on the Supreme Court … [but] what were you like when you were 17, you know?"
iFrame Object
Democratic attacks on Kavanaugh ramped up again after New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly adapted an excerpt from their book for an article in the newspaper.
The article appeared to drop a bombshell accusation against Kavanaugh that had not yet been reported, but the New York Times later corrected the article to reflect that the alleged victim did not remember the incident in question.
Before the article was corrected, several Democratic presidential candidates called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

ANALYSIS: Does Schiff already know the Trump whistleblower's story?

Texto completo: Did House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff have the inside details about the Trump whistleblower two weeks ago?
Earlier this month, the California Democrat announced a “wide-ranging investigation” into allegations President Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine’s government into aiding his reelection campaign.
Schiff ordered the investigation on Sept. 9, hours before he received the first of two letters from the intelligence community inspector general revealing the existence of a whistleblower complaint. Multiple news outlets reported this week that the complaint involved, at least in part, a phone conversation between Trump and recently elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Inspector General Michael K. Atkinson's letter didn't provide Schiff with the details, but some Republicans say they suspect Schiff knew them already and was orchestrating a headline-grabbing story from his perch on the intelligence panel.
Earlier on the day the Atkinson letter arrived, Schiff demanded the Trump administration turn over documents and correspondence related to Trump’s alleged attempts to get Ukraine government officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Included in his list was the transcript of Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, which news reports say alarmed the whistleblower.
Schiff insisted to reporters Thursday that he doesn’t know the details of the complaint and accused the president of “trying to stifle whistleblower complaints" and blocking the information from reaching Congress.
Joseph Maguire, Trump’s acting director of national intelligence, is restricting Atkinson from providing any details about the complaint, Schiff charged after he and other intelligence panel members met privately Thursday with Atkinson.
But news reports soon emerged saying it involved the call with Zelensky and matched Schiff’s comments about the matter Sept. 9.
In a press release that day, Schiff announced an investigation by the intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight panels into efforts by Trump and his attorney former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani to get Ukraine government officials to turn over information about Joe Biden, the leading Democratic presidential candidate.
Trump and Giuliani have been seeking data on Biden’s role, while he was vice president under Barack Obama, in pressuring the Ukraine government to fire a prosecutor targeting a Ukrainian gas company on whose board Biden’s son Hunter served.
“While his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani pressures Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 campaign, Trump withholds vital aid Ukraine needs to defend against Russia,” Schiff tweeted Sept. 9.
Schiff’s representative did not respond to a request for a comment about the fact the Ukraine investigation was ordered the same day Atkinson sent the letter about the whistleblower complaint.
The congressman contends he does not know the identity of the whistleblower or the nature of the complaint and has threatened to take the Trump administration to court to win access to the information.
Schiff’s announcement of the Ukraine investigation also followed a New York Times investigation into the matter.
In his Sept. 9 letter to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, Schiff demanded the Ukraine call transcript be turned over to the committee by Sept. 16, a deadline that passed without any cooperation from the White House.
Two days later, the first leaked whistleblower story appeared in the news.

Texto completo: When UConn has the ball: UConn handed off the ball 53 times in its season opener, but called for significantly more pass plays in its second game with freshman Jack Zergiotis at quarterback. Indiana has been stingier against the pass than against the run so far this season, so don't be surprised if the Huskies return to a run-heavy approach, leaning on tailbacks Kevin Mensah and Art Thompkins.
When Indiana has the ball: As of Friday, Indiana hadn't revealed who would start at quarterback: redshirt freshman Michael Penix Jr., who played the first two games but sat last week with an injury, or junior Peyton Ramsey. Whoever gets the nod won't have an easy time against a UConn defense that, after struggling deeply last year, now ranks 17th in the country in fewest passing yards allowed per game.
UConn impact player on offense: Zergiotis got the surprise start against Illinois and quickly showed why. The freshman from Montreal flung the ball across the field, finding receivers in tight coverage and finishing with 275 yards on the day. The downside of his gunslinger mentality? He also committed three turnovers in his debut. Against Indiana, Zergiotis will look to maintain the big-play production while curbing the giveaways.
UConn impact player on defense: Linebacker D.J. Morgan, who transferred to Storrs after three years at Notre Dame, leads the American Athletic Conference with 9.5 tackles per game. His third-quarter strip sack against Illinois kept UConn close in what eventually became a close loss. Morgan is a big reason the Huskies' defense seems to have taken a significant step forward this year.
UConn impact player on special teams: Kick coverage was somewhat an issue in UConn's most recent game, when Illinois averaged 32.6 yards on five returns, including one that went 68 yards. Against Indiana, Ian Swenson (who earned a game ball for his special-teams performance in a win over Wagner) and the rest of the Huskies' coverage team could be crucial.
Indiana impact player on offense: Hoosiers running back Stevie Scott gashed the Big Ten last year with 1,137 rushing yards. And though he's off to a slow start in 2019 (118 rushing yards on 3.2 yards per carry), he remains dangerous, both as a runner and as a pass-catcher. With Indiana's uncertainty at quarterback, he could get plenty of touches against UConn.
Indiana impact player on defense: Fifth-year senior Reakwon Jones leads Indiana with 18 tackles, after recording 36 in 2018. He's one of the steadiest and most experienced players on a Hoosiers D that has looked impressive at times this season (shutting out Eastern Illinois) and porous at others (giving up 51 points to No. 6 Ohio State).
Indiana impact player on special teams: Senior kicker Logan Justus was named second-team All-Big Ten last year, and for good reason: He hits 83.3 percent of his field goals and 97 percent of his extra-point attempts. So far this year, he's five-for-five on field goal attempts, including a 50-yarder.
About Indiana's coach: Tom Allen has led Indiana since the final game of the 2016 season, going 12-16 in that time. Before becoming Hoosiers head coach, Allen spent three years coaching linebackers at Ole Miss, one year as defensive coordinator at South Florida and one year in that same role at Indiana.
Indiana mascot: None
Famous Indiana alumni: Suzanne Collins (novelist known for "The Hunger Games"), Ryan Murphy (TV producer), Laverne Cox (actress), Dan Quayle (former U.S. vice president), Will Shortz (New York Times crossword-puzzle creator/editor), Jim Jones (cult leader), Joe Buck (sportscaster), Sage Steele (sports anchor), Mark Cuban (Dallas Mavericks owner), Mark Spitz (former Olympic swimmer), Isiah Thomas (National Basketball Hall of Famer), Victor Oladipo (NBA All-Star)
Road test: Saturday will mark UConn's first away game of the season, after the Huskies failed to record a road win in 2018. UConn's most recent victory away from Rentschler Field came Oct. 14, 2017 at Temple. Before that? Nov. 7, 2015 at Tulane.
Well rested: UConn had the first of two open weeks last week, giving players a chance to regroup and recover after their first two games. Coach Randy Edsall and his players say they expect the extra rest to help Saturday.
Big Ten once again: For the second game in a row, UConn will face a team from the Big Ten. With the announcement this week that the Huskies have agreed to a home-and-home series with Maryland, the program now has four Big Ten opponents on its future schedules: Indiana, Illinois, Purdue and Maryland.
What's the word: "Personally for me, I like away games a lot more. Not that I don't like playing in front of the home crowd at the Rent, but away games it's a lot easier to just focus in and not worry about distractions." - Thompkins

Texto completo: Ms. Chicago, who has new shows in Los Angeles and Washington, talks about pioneering female painters.
Judy Chicago, the feminist artist and author, is playing to the coasts this month. There is a show of her important early work at Jeffrey Deitch's gallery in Los Angeles through Nov. 2, and a new series done in painted porcelain and glass called "The End: A Meditation on Death and Extinction," opening Thursday at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington. Her most famous work, "The Dinner Party," an epic 1979 installation that imagined a gathering of 39 important women sidelined by history, continues on permanent view at the Brooklyn Museum.
Recently she brought fireworks to the small town of Belen, N.M., where she has lived since 1996. The pyrotechnics celebrated the opening of a new public space for her nonprofit arts organization, Through the Flower -- and her 80th birthday. Last month at her first event there, Ms. Chicago spoke with Jori Finkel -- a contributor to The New York Times and the author of "It Speaks to Me: Art That Inspires Artists" -- about a source of inspiration for her own work: female pioneers of abstract painting, including Georgia O'Keeffe, Hilma af Klint and Agnes Pelton. Of the three, Pelton (1981-1961), is still on history's sidelines, but that is changing: A major survey, "Agnes Pelton: Desert Transcendentalist," travels from the Phoenix Art Museum to the New Mexico Museum of Art on Oct. 5 and arrives next spring in New York, at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
These are edited excerpts from their conversation.
JORI FINKEL Why does Agnes Pelton's work speak to you?
JUDY CHICAGO I love her work. She was a contemporary of Georgia O'Keeffe who worked in New Mexico and then retreated to the desert in California. She was part of the Transcendental Painting Group, painters very interested in inflecting their work with spirituality. Whenever I saw a Pelton painting -- which was rare, actually; one here, one there -- I was always drawn to the luminosity: a sense of light and inner light that I have also attempted to bring into my work.
You've been a fan of her "Awakening (Memory of Father)," from 1943, for years now.
My reading of the painting is that it's a dreamlike scene, an abstracted landscape with day and night present at once. It has this form in the sky that's been described as a golden trumpet. But if you look closely, underneath that shape and also on top, is a faint texture that makes it feel like it's moving. For me that form is a luminous symbol of death. Agnes Pelton's father died when she was 10 years old. My father died when I was 13, and I also dealt with his death through abstraction. Pelton used abstraction to convey personal meaning as opposed to just dripping paint on canvas, like Jackson Pollock, or making abstract forms, like Ellsworth Kelly. One of my theories is that until the advent of abstraction, women artists were not free to convey their experiences directly. Abstraction opened up the visual landscape for us to invent forms to convey our internal reality.
Besides Pelton, which other artists are you thinking of?
Natalia Goncharova, Sonia Delaunay, Georgia O'Keeffe, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, starting from the early 20th century when abstraction became a possible mode of expression. Earlier, women artists such as Artemisia Gentileschi had to fit their forms into an art historical tradition created by men, like the way she used [her rendering of] the biblical theme of Judith beheading Holofernes to express the violence of being raped.
Hilma af Klint has also been a real revelation in the art world lately since her recent show at the Guggenheim.
That's an understatement [laughs].
Usually we tell the history of abstraction by identifying three or four men who invented abstraction around the same time in 1913: Mondrian, Malevich, Kandinsky and Frantisek Kupka. Seeing Hilma af Klint's "Paintings for the Temple" at the Guggenheim, which she began in 1906 as a result of her séances, just upended this history.
This show was momentous for art history because this has been an agreed-upon narrative promoted by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) all over the world: Modern art was invented by four male artists. Nope.
Even recently, in a 2013 show called "Inventing Abstraction" that tried to complicate the story of abstraction with over 80 artists, MoMA didn't include Hilma af Klint. Their reasoning was that she wasn't a truly abstract artist because she was representing the spiritual realm. And now Agnes Pelton is being called by critics the new Hilma af Klint.
Historically there's a precedent for that. There was a woman named Hildegard of Bingen, for example, from the High Middle Ages, who was an abbot and then two centuries later, some other religious mystic would be called the Hildegard of Bingen of the 14th century. So now we have the Hilma af Klint category into which all these other women are slotted. No, just let Agnes Pelton be Agnes Pelton.
Sonia Delaunay, who with her husband, Robert Delaunay, developed this colorful, symphonic sort of abstraction called Orphism, has an interesting history. It was in 1911 that her painting went from figurative to abstract. She always said the turning point was making a patchwork quilt for her infant son. And she went on to work as a designer in fashion, costumes, stage sets and books. Could design and craft be one root of abstract painting?
That's very interesting. I remember many years ago there was an article in an art magazine about the artist Liza Lou, who does beaded work, and instead of placing her work in the context of the history of beading, like Native American beading or women's crafts, they put her in the tradition of Andy Warhol. Because the way to validate an artist, particularly a woman artist, is to put them in the context of the important male art. What you're talking about now opens up the possibility of starting to see women in our own tradition. I've looked at so much work by other women to validate my own sense of form and also color. When I look at Hilma af Klint's paintings and see all those pastels, I'm like: Whoa, I love that kind of color.
Pelton, Hilma af Klint, Delaunay and O'Keeffe were all bold colorists, although in her first group of abstractions O'Keeffe deliberately avoided color.
I did that too in my first decade of creative practice, because in graduate school they gave me so much grief about my choice of colors. They hated my colors. So for a time my work was monochrome, like with the "10 Part Cylinders" at Jeffrey's show [which Ms. Chicago made from fiberglass in 1966 with the help of boat-builders -- and remade for the Deitch show]. It allowed me to focus on form, so I can see why she did that.
Barbara Haskell, a curator at the Whitney, talks about the Art Nouveau origins of O'Keeffe's abstracted forms: They're spirals, snails, tendrils and snaking forms -- natural forms, not mechanical.
One reason I selected O'Keeffe and Virginia Woolf to add to "The Dinner Party" table is that I believe these two women began to forge a female-centered language in both art and literature that became a foundation for countless women artists. I used to talk to Anaïs Nin, my mentor, in the early '70s. Could there be a 'female form language' in art? At that time it was completely outside the art dialogue. The biggest compliment you could give a woman artist then was to say she paints like a man.
In the '60s my L.A. gallerist Rolf Nelson had a 24-foot cloud painting by O'Keeffe hanging in his gallery for sale for $ 35,000, and no one was interested. People don't remember when O'Keeffe was dismissed or when Frida Kahlo was referred to as "Diego Rivera's wife, who also paints." All of that changed because of the feminist art movement, and now we're seeing decades of scholarship beginning to bring new understanding to a lot of this work.

New video surfaces showing Canada's Trudeau in blackface, compounding scandal

Texto completo: Revelations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has dressed up in brownface and blackface on multiple occasions have rocked his reelection campaign, reinforcing a narrative that has dogged him throughout his political career: that he isn't really who he portrays himself to be.
Trudeau has long cast himself as a glittering spokesman for the world's beleaguered liberals, standing up to President Donald Trump, supporting gender and Indigenous rights, welcoming immigrants, and fighting climate change and racism.
But that carefully calibrated image suffered a major blow this week when photos and a video emerged of the prime minister dressing up as racist caricatures in the early 1990s and in 2001.
One showed him at an "Arabian Nights" party, dressed up as Aladdin in brownface makeup and a turban, his arms wrapped around a woman. The picture was taken while Trudeau was 29 and teaching at a school in Vancouver, British Columbia.
While apologizing for that image at an appearance on Wednesday night, Trudeau also admitted 10 dressing up in blackface while performing "Day-O," the Jamaican folk song, in high school.
Then, on Thursday morning, more damaging material surfaced. Trudeau's campaign spokeswoman, Zita Astravas, confirmed that a video posted by Global-News, a Canada-based news organization, showed the prime minister in the early 1990s dressed in blackface and an Afro wig. In the video, he is waving his hands around and sticking out his tongue.
And the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. posted another photo from the 2001 "Arabian Nights" party. In it, Trudeau, again in brown-face and wearing a turban, has his arms around two Sikh men.
The new disclosures come only a few months after accusations surfaced that Trudeau had bullied his former justice minister and attorney general, an Indigenous woman, while pressing her to settle corruption charges against a major Quebec engineering company. When she didn't comply, she accused him of demoting her.
"Justin Trudeau has carefully crafted an image of what Canadians aspire to: hope, openness to the world and youth," said Jean-Marc Leger, chief executive of Leger, a leading polling company in Montreal. "The blackface episode shatters that perfect image and casts questions on his authenticity."
Nevertheless, he said, Canadians were a "forgiving people" and predicted that Trudeau, who on Wednesday night apologized repeatedly for behavior that had taken place nearly two decades ago, could still recover.
"This is something I shouldn't have done many years ago," Trudeau said. "It was something that I didn't think was racist at the time, but now I recognize it was something racist to do, and I am deeply sorry."
Nik Nanos, the founder of Nanos Research, an Ottawa polling firm, said that finding a way back, while not impossible, will be very difficult for Trudeau and his Liberal Party.
"This is about as bad news as you can get in a campaign," he said. "The Liberals have to find a way to change the channel."
Trudeau's principal opponents are the Conservatives and their leader, Andrew Scheer. According to the nightly polls Nanos runs, support for Scheer started inching upward recently, even before this incident. The increase came after Conservatives began running attack ads suggesting that the prime minister was "not as advertised."
"The Justin Trudeau revelation is a validation of the Conservative attack," Nanos said.
"Right now the election is about Justin Trudeau," Nanos added. "And in my experience, the person an election is about loses."
In many ways Trudeau has a strong hand as the Oct. 21 national election approaches. Canada's economy is vibrant, with unemployment at historic lows. His move to bring in 25,000 Syrian refugees was widely acclaimed and his government introduced several pioneering policies including legalizing recreational marijuana and assisted dying.
His Cabinet, made up half of women and including four Sikhs and a Somali-born immigration minister, has also come to embody a country that prides itself on its multiculturalism and inclusiveness.
But he has been taken to task for seeming inconsistent with his image. Even as he proposed a national carbon tax, for example, following through on his promises to fight climate change, he used $4.5 billion in government money to buy an oil pipeline.
Others complain that he is an Instagram prime minister, too fixated on image and optics at the expense of implementing policy.
"Everything the prime minister does is a calculation about his image," said Nicola Di Iorio, who recently stepped down as a Liberal member of parliament of a multicultural district in Montreal. "There are too many gimmicks."

Shoddy NYT report advances media siege on Kavanaugh

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 20 Sep 2019: 10.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/shoddy-nyt-report-advances-media-siege-on/docview/2295356841/se-2?accountid=14708

Resumen: In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism. © 2019, Washington Post Writers Group

Texto completo: The recent fiasco at The New York Times, which last weekend published the latest uncorroborated sexual-assault accusation against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a monument to hearsay and a travesty of journalistic ethics.
The story, since modified to include crucial information, was an adapted excerpt from a book — "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," written by two Times’ staff writers, Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. In it, the authors reported allegations by a Yale classmate that Kavanaugh was at a "drunken dorm party" where "friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student."
Setting aside the logistics of such a feat, more eye-popping was the omission from the original Times’ piece that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed for the book — and, according to friends, doesn’t remember any such incident.
Such an oversight is inexcusable.
The Times added these details to the story after they were flagged by The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, who had an advance copy of the book. The Times’ writers, who said that the details had been in the excerpt’s initial draft, made media rounds Monday and Tuesday to explain the omission and essentially blamed editors, who, they said, "in the haste" of trying to close out production, had deleted the reference.
The facts that the alleged victim refused to be interviewed by the authors and apparently told friends that she doesn’t recall any such incident amount to the very definition of a non-story. For the record, The Washington Post learned of the accusation last year but declined to publish it because the alleged witnesses weren’t identified and the woman said to be involved refused to comment.
Indeed, the authors’ only sources for the claim were two unnamed officials who spoke to Washington attorney Max Stier, who last year apparently told the FBI and various senators that he witnessed the alleged incident. But Stier refused to talk to the Times’ writers himself.
Some Democratic contenders for the presidency immediately called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. They include Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Sen. Kamala Harris, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
But let’s rewind the reel a bit. With apologies to my grandmothers, the reason The Times’ writers likely included the penis-in-hand accusation at all is because it added context to the accusations by both Deborah Ramirez, who alleged last year that she experienced sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh at another boozy Yale party, and Christine Blasey Ford.
Ramirez, for her part, initially wasn’t quite sure of events. She has admitted to time lapses and also to having been drunk, but told The New Yorker and the Times writers that she remembers brushing away a penis thrust in her face, allegedly by Kavanaugh.
If these stories are true, then Kavanaugh could have been a creepy, perhaps monstrous, drunk in his youth. But all we have to go by is alleged victims who also were drinking at the time and comments from former classmates, who may also have been inebriated, some of whom corroborate the Ramirez accusation and others who dispute it. The Times’ writers reported finding seven people who they say corroborated Ramirez’s story, but much of what they documented were second- and third-hand reports, things overheard and, yes, Ramirez’s mother, to whom she apparently said "Something happened at Yale."
Not exactly a wrap for justice.
The truth is, Kavanaugh has been the target of a media siege since his name was announced for consideration for the high court. Ramirez’s story was first reported by The New Yorker just days before Ford’s congressional testimony, which, frankly, was flimsy at best. None of the other four people Ford named as attending the high school party where she claimed Kavanaugh groped her recalled any such gathering. One of them, a close friend and the only other female, Leland Keyser, not only doesn’t remember the party — but says she’s never even met Kavanaugh.
What’s all too clear is that America’s privileged youth had a serious drinking problem in the early 1980s; and boozy memories from high school and young adulthood are unreliable. Far more troubling is that several presidential candidates seemingly would impeach a Supreme Court justice on nothing more than hearsay — and impeachable journalism.

Why Trump Is Winning on Iran; The U.S. should focus on sanctions while letting the Saudis cope with any nasty local spillovers.

Texto completo: Delicacy forbids resorting to the suggestion that comes to mind in response to an Arab academic declaiming in the pages of the New York Times against Donald Trump's restraint with respect to Iran's military provocations. "Trump, in his response to Iran, is even worse than Obama,'' Abdulkhaleq Abdulla told the paper, which described him as "a prominent political scientist in the United Arab Emirates."
He went on: "Now an Arab Gulf strategic partner has been massively attacked by Iran—which was provoked by Trump, not by us—and we hear Americans saying to us, you need to defend yourselves! It is an utter failure and utter disappointment in this administration."
The Trump sanctions are having their desired effect, weakening the Iranian regime and indicating why its regional machinations are ultimately leading toward a dead end. This is already serving Arab interests incidentally. If there is some regional blowback, such as the drone and cruise-missile attack on a Saudi oil facility, in the spirit of burden-sharing let the Saudis take the steps necessary to repay or repel such attacks if they wish.
Our policy is working. Only when and if it serves our interest do we need to respond militarily (though it might be useful to strengthen the effect of sanctions by attacking under-the-table Iranian oil exports). It does not need to be done, as Arab and other critics suggest, to validate the 40-year U.S. policy of preventing any rival power from dominating the gulf and its oil resources.
We don't have to prove that commitment at the drop of every hat. One of the many benefits of the U.S. domestic oil resurgence is that we don't have to overreact to lesser disruptions of the oil flow from every regional spat or upset. The world economy remains adequately supplied. If prices go up a bit, the U.S. now benefits as a major producer, offsetting some of the damage on the consumer side.
Our position is stronger than ever. Only weak nations need to overreact.
Which is just as well. Even Donald Trump's most devoted followers, for better or worse, have little desire to see him become a war president. They sense that recent wars haven't served U.S. interests. They understand that the peculiar dynamics of the Trump presidency would not provide the unifying and rallying oomph that sometimes makes war an attractive domestic political proposition. Nor would being a war president particularly suit Mr. Trump's episodic and wandering leadership style.
Which is also fine. There is no reason to oblige the Iranians and the Saudis, in their different ways, in how we respond to the attack. The Iranian goal is to lure the U.S. into a confrontation that Washington would eventually be wiling to pay to get out of, presumably by lifting sanctions and resuming the Obama nuclear payola. For the Saudis and their local allies, they wish to see the world's superpower expend some of its military stockpiles to degrade Iran's offensive capabilities in ways that would convenience them but wouldn't do much for us.
Let's recall that the billions the U.S. invests in global military power are aimed not just at keeping the Gulf open, but also at making others feel how much they rely on the U.S. to keep it open. The Chinese, in particular, hardly need at this exact moment to see us reflexively allowing ourselves to be baited by local tinpots into protecting China's ability to consume Mideast oil. On the contrary, the present occasion represents a nice opportunity to demonstrate the flexibility America now enjoys in this matter thanks to its own fracking revolution and rising energy power.
There are no guarantees, but the evidence so far is encouraging. Sanctions have cut Iran's oil exports by 90% since April 2018. The regime is plodding toward a domestic crisis that, as of now, Iran's leadership appears to hope it can escape by initiating provocations meant to suggest a wider war unless the U.S. backs down. Yet these war threats, if allowed to materialize, would only accelerate Iran's domestic crisis. Though more provocations may be coming, these would only make it tougher for a future Democratic president to cancel the sanctions and reinstate the Obama nuclear deal. It's hard to see a way out of Iran's sanctions trap except by meeting U.S. demands to curb its obnoxious regional behavior.
Whether from shrewdness or instinct or an inability to reconcile his bellicose Twitter style with his urge for deals, Mr. Trump's administration has defaulted to a useful strategy. It consists of letting sanctions work while leaving it to our local partners to cope with any spillovers that don't fundamentally affect U.S. interests.

Georgia officials: Five lung cases tied to vaping

Texto completo: State public health officials have confirmed five cases of vaping-related lung illnesses in Georgia, with another 10 being investigated.
Those figures, released this week, add to the CDC's national total of at least 380 confirmed and probable cases in 36 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The CDC has reported six deaths from the vaping-related illnesses, and a seventh was reported this week by public health officials in California, the state's second fatality.
The Atlanta-based federal health agency has activated emergency operations to expand its probe of the outbreak of lung illnesses connected with e-cigarettes.
Vaping devices mimic cigarettes but produce inhalable vapors instead of smoke. E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine, like that found in tobacco, but some contain THC, the psychoactive ingredient in
marijuana. While the devices are marketed as alternatives to actual smoking, health experts say they cause problems of their own.
The CDC is working with the FDA to collect information about recent e-cigarette product use among lung disease patients and to test the substances or chemicals within e-cigarette products used in these cases.
Patients usually have experienced coughing, chest pain or shortness of breath before their health deteriorated to the point that they needed to be hospitalized.
Their various diagnoses have included lipoid pneumonia (which can occur when oil enters the lungs), and acute eosinophilic pneumonia (caused by the buildup of a type of white blood cell in the lungs) and acute respiratory distress syndrome, NPR reported. The latter is a life-threatening condition in which fluid builds up in the lungs and prevents the oxygen that people's bodies need from circulating in the bloodstream.
The CDC has warned that if people are concerned about these specific health risks, they should consider refraining from using e-cigarette or vaping products.
The outbreak has affected users of both nicotine-containing products and those containing THC. But it is more prevalent among people who report vaping THC than those who say they use only nicotine products, NPR reported.
The nationwide investigation has found no particular vaping devices or products linked to all cases, the Washington Post reported. Investigators are looking into the possibility that people are getting contaminated products, or even counterfeit products, because many victims report having bought marijuana on the street rather than from a store, the Post said.
The CDC suspects "chemical exposure."
In all confirmed cases, patients reported vaping within 90 days of developing symptoms, and most had vaped within a week of onset of symptoms.
The New York Times reported that states are rushing to push through bans on e-cigarettes for anyone under 21. Governors are calling for prohibitions on flavors like bubble gum, cotton candy and banana split, which critics say are meant to entice young people into trying vaping. And in some states, lawmakers are contemplating raising taxes on vaping products as a way to discourage their use.

Texto completo: One reader calls Charles M. Blow's critique "character assassination" while another views it as "incisive."
To the Editor:
Re "Joe Biden Is Problematic," by Charles M. Blow (column, Sept. 16):
Let me get this straight. Mr. Blow, your take is to disregard Joe Biden's actions over nearly five decades of public life, and to focus instead on comments, taken out of any historical context, made decades ago, to attack his views on race. You claim you bear Mr. Biden no ill will, yet you deny him the right to change or evolve. That is not fair or decent, and ignores a good man who has committed his life to racial justice.
Reparations are a difficult, emotional issue, and ultimately a distraction from the public policies that can have a direct impact on the lives of anyone who has suffered from discrimination, or who continues to suffer.
Mr. Biden's support among people of color is no accident. It runs deep. I can only wish that his sensitivity and understanding were typical of his generation.
I have known Joe Biden for most of his years in public service. I worked for his son Beau as a deputy attorney general. I don't always agree with Joe on the issues (I am more of the Sanders/Warren persuasion), but I won't tolerate character assassination in the guise of journalism. If you have policy differences with Mr. Biden, then out with it. Don't hide behind selective quotations.
Dirk Durstein
Wilmington, Del.
To the Editor:
Charles M. Blow's incisive critique of Joe Biden helped me to crystallize what exactly bothers me so much about Mr. Biden. His racism and hypocrisy, and his unwillingness to learn, listen or grow, are unnervingly disturbing to me, since he is the current front-runner.
I hope that Mr. Blow's critique will illuminate these issues for both black and white voters. C'mon, Dems! We have so many other truly exciting and qualified candidates. Warren, Bernie, Booker, Harris. Even Beto and Castro. We decide, as voters, who is not only electable but also right for the job!

Lawyers Say Trump Cannot Be Criminally Investigated

Texto completo: The president's legal team is trying to block a subpoena seeking his tax returns, claiming that any criminal investigation of Mr. Trump is unconstitutional.
Lawyers for President Trump argued in a lawsuit filed on Thursday that he could not be criminally investigated while in office, as they sought to block a subpoena from state prosecutors in Manhattan demanding eight years of his tax returns.
Taking a broad position that the lawyers acknowledged had not been tested, the president's legal team argued in the complaint that the Constitution effectively makes sitting presidents immune from all criminal inquiries until they leave the White House.
Presidents, they asserted, have such enormous responsibility and play a unique role in government that they cannot be subject to the burden of investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain.
Several constitutional law scholars interviewed by The New York Times said that if the lawyers' position were accepted by the court, it would set a sweeping new precedent.
But they also said it was far from certain that the theory, which was not based on established case law, would succeed. While an onslaught of investigations would most assuredly disrupt a presidency, the Constitution does not explicitly say that presidents are shielded from criminal inquiries.
"President Trump's position that he is unequivocally beyond the reach of criminal investigators is doubtfully absolutist," said Joshua Matz, who wrote, with Laurence H. Tribe, "To End a Presidency: The Power of Impeachment."
At the least, the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan, is likely to delay the latest attempt to secure Mr. Trump's financial records.
The lawsuit was filed in response to a subpoena issued late last month by the Manhattan district attorney's office to Mr. Trump's accounting firm. The subpoena sought eight years of the president's personal and corporate tax returns as the office investigates the role that Mr. Trump and his family business played in hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.
Both Mr. Trump and the company reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president's former lawyer and fixer, for money that Mr. Cohen paid to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the affair.
The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen said in a court filing in July that they had "effectively concluded" their investigation into possible crimes committed by the president's company, the Trump Organization, or its executives. Neither the company nor any of its leaders were charged. However, the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., is exploring whether the reimbursements violated any New York state laws.
The lawsuit filed on Thursday was the latest effort by the president and his legal team to stymie multiple attempts to obtain copies of his tax returns, which Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he would make public but has since refused to disclose.
Mr. Trump's lawyers have sued to block attempts by congressional Democrats and New York lawmakers to gain access to his tax returns and financial records. They also challenged a California law requiring presidential primary candidates to release their tax returns, and a federal judge ruled in their favor on Thursday. But their arguments in those cases had been made on narrower grounds.
It is an open question whether sitting presidents are immune from prosecution while in office. The Constitution does not explicitly address the issue, and the Supreme Court has never answered the question.
Federal prosecutors are barred from charging a sitting president with a federal crime because the Justice Department -- in memos written during the Nixon and Clinton administrations -- has decided that presidents have temporary immunity while they are in office. The memos indicate that any wrongdoing should be addressed through impeachment, not the courts.
Those memos, however, do not bind the hands of state prosecutors.
"I think there is some force to the argument that states can't be allowed to hobble presidents with local prosecutions, but there is certainly no authority for the claim that they cannot at least investigate while a president is in office," said Frank O. Bowman III, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of "High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump."
Presidents have been subject to federal criminal inquiries in the past, including Mr. Trump, who was recently a subject of an investigation conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, that examined ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Mueller said in May that the Justice Department "explicitly permits" the investigation of presidents, although he acknowledged that they could not be charged with federal crimes.
In their lawsuit, Mr. Trump's lawyers took their arguments a step further, saying that not only are criminal charges against a president unconstitutional, so are investigations. They took particular issue with any investigation conducted by "a county prosecutor," such as the Manhattan district attorney.
"We are in court to protect the president's rights and the Constitution," said Marc L. Mukasey, a lawyer for the Trump Organization.
Mr. Vance, a Democrat, is seeking a range of tax documents from Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, including federal and state tax returns for both the president and his company, dating to 2011.
In their lawsuit, the lawyers, who have repeatedly called Mr. Vance's investigation politically motivated, wrote that prosecutors looking to advance their careers were particularly susceptible to opening investigations that could interfere with presidential duties.
"A county prosecutor in New York, for what appears to be the first time in our nation's history, is attempting to do just that," the complaint said.
The court papers described behind-the-scenes negotiations between the two sides. Mr. Trump's lawyers said that they had been in negotiations with the district attorney's office over an earlier subpoena issued to the Trump Organization. When Mr. Vance's office asked for the company's tax returns, Mr. Trump's lawyers resisted. The prosecutors then sent a subpoena to the accounting firm, this time including the president's personal returns as well.
The president's legal team called the action a "bad faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information." The lawyers are seeking an injunction preventing both Mazars and Mr. Vance from taking action on the subpoena until after Mr. Trump leaves office.
A spokesman for Mr. Vance said the district attorney would respond in court and had no additional comment. Mazars said it would "respect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations."
Judge Victor Marrero of Federal District Court in Manhattan will hear arguments in the case on Wednesday. In a letter, Mr. Vance's office said it had agreed to delay enforcement of its subpoena until then.
Mr. Vance's investigation has been focused on $ 130,000 that Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, just before the election. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last year to violating federal campaign finance laws. He received a three-year prison sentence.
Mr. Vance's office has been investigating whether the Trump Organization falsely accounted for the reimbursements as a legal expense. It was unclear if the scope of the subpoena -- including Mr. Trump's personal records -- meant that the inquiry had widened.
In New York, filing a false business record can be a felony only if prosecutors can prove that the filing was made to commit or conceal another crime, such as tax violations or bank fraud. Mr. Trump's tax returns, if Mr. Vance's office obtains them, would be protected by rules governing grand jury secrecy and not become public unless they were used as evidence in a criminal case.

Texto completo: The U.S. Navy confirmed this week that three leaked videos of unidentified flying objects were the real deal, calling them "unidentified aerial phenomena."
The videos, which were shared by To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science and the New York Times in 2017 and 2018, appear to show flying craft on grainy video that caused shock and awe even to the fighter pilots who witnessed them.
"The three videos (one from 2004 and two from 2015) show incursions into our military training ranges by unidentified aerial phenomena," Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said in a statement. "The Navy has characterized the observed phenomena as unidentified."
To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science, dedicated to the study of UFOs and extraterrestrial life, brought broad attention to the three videos after extensively sharing and discussing them. TSSAS was co-founded by the former lead singer of Blink-182, Tom DeLonge, who has spent much of the last several years dedicated to studying aerial phenomena.
The three videos are known as "FLIR1," "Gimbal," and "GoFast" among the internet, though the Navy declined to use the names in their statement. The Navy did confirm that the oldest video, known as FLIR1, was filmed on an aircraft from the USS Nimitz in 2004.
While TSSAS asserted that the videos had gone through a declassification process, the Navy said that they were not sure how the videos were leaked to the public. The oldest video was said to have been widely shared aboard the Nimitz, but when the Navy was made aware of the leak in 2009, they declined to pursue the matter, citing the large crew size of 5,000 and the amount of time elapsed.
"These videos are copies of official Navy footage taken by Naval personnel conducting training missions in controlled military airspace," Gradisher said in the Navy statement.iFrame Object

Texto completo: Want to do something about climate change by reducing carbon emissions? If you're serious, that "something" has to include a massive commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants worldwide, as well as making sure that existing nuclear power plants don't go offline until they can be replaced by new ones.
Nuclear power is the only major, established, proven source of power that has zero carbon emissions. Of the carbon-free alternatives, only hydroelectric has a long track record as a major power source, and you can only dam so many rivers; solar and wind are still in the teething stages and are unlikely to carry the load any time soon.
Nuclear power is reliable, safe and well understood. If you oppose nuclear power but call climate change a crisis, then you're speaking nonsense, unless you simply want to reduce energy consumption in America to something like what's seen in current day Venezuela, in which case you're just speaking a different kind of nonsense.
Most, but not all, of the Democratic candidates for president are vague on the subject, silent or opposed to nuclear power. But not all. Cory Booker has been a "full-throated" supporter of nuclear power, and nuclear power gets a big boost from Andrew Yang's 2020 climate change plan.
According to Yang's plan, "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move towards creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people – including some other candidates – dismiss it out of hand. Why does it have such a bad reputation? ... First, the public's perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like Chernobyl and The Simpsons."
Yang continues: "When the OECD (11), NEA (11), and NASA (12) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared to other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that's not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels. With modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased."
That's exactly right. Yang is particularly interested in reactors powered by thorium instead of uranium, because thorium is more efficient, and more plentiful, and because thorium reactors can't produce materials suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Plus: "Thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors. Thorium waste remains radioactive for several hundred years instead of several thousand years. Thorium-based molten salt reactors are safer than earlier-generation nuclear reactors, and the potential for a catastrophic event is negligible, due to the design of the reactor and the fact that thorium is not, by itself, fissile."
If you take climate change seriously, you have to take nuclear power seriously. As Mike Shellenberger writes in Forbes, if Germany and California had based their emissions plans on nuclear instead of "renewables" like solar and wind, they'd have 100% clean power now.
But they didn't, and they don't, and the question is whether the rest of us will learn from their mistake. The International Energy Agency reports that planned nuclear retirements will already lead to 4 billion metric tons of extra carbon dioxide emissions. If it makes sense to keep functioning reactors online longer rather than replacing them with fossil fuels, then surely it makes sense to replace existing fossil fuel plants with new nuclear reactors.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden "decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world's most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power.

Chasing Big Stories in an Office on Wheels

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? David Enrich, the finance editor, discussed the tech he's using.
What are your go-to tech tools for work and why?
You will be shocked to hear that I have an intimate relationship with my iPhone. I use it for all the regular stuff: emails, texts, a variety of messaging apps, Twitter, news, taking photos and videos. Even talking to people.
My MacBook Pro laptop is compact enough that I can easily write or edit stories (and my forthcoming book!) on it during my scenic 36-minute train ride to and from The Suburbs.
Speaking of the 'burbs, my other prized piece of hardware is my black 2017 Toyota Sienna minivan. It has tinted windows and all-wheel drive. My boss, Ellen Pollock, thinks I'm lying, but I regularly put in time from my mobile office. With my wife behind the wheel, I have worked on articles about Brett Kavanaugh, Les Moonves, Jeffrey Epstein and, my favorite topic, Deutsche Bank. Sometimes I whip out my laptop and create a Wi-Fi hot spot with my iPhone. Other times I use Bluetooth to pipe in phone calls over the Sienna's booming sound system.
So you often edit and report on sensitive stories. How do you protect the confidentiality of sources and leave no digital trace?
I use encrypted chat programs like WhatsApp and Signal for communicating with sources and, increasingly, colleagues. (It beats Slack, which is the bane of my existence.) For security's sake, my colleagues and I generally avoid discussing confidential sources via electronic communications.
I take notes by hand rather than by typing. One reason is that sources hear a keyboard clacking and are reminded that a journalist is keeping track of what they say -- not helpful! Also, my proprietary, heavily encrypted note-taking system (i.e. illegible handwriting) ensures that my little spiral notebooks are useless to anyone other than me.
As an aside, can I mention that LinkedIn is wonderful? I use it on a near-daily basis to identify and make contact with potential sources. Sometimes I just loiter on the site. Earlier this year, I noticed that a Deutsche Bank employee had viewed my profile. I sent him a message asking if he'd like to talk. He said yes, we spoke by phone, and soon I was pursuing what would become a front-page story.
I recently also started using a service called Lusha, which plugs into LinkedIn and provides phone numbers and email addresses for people to whom I'm not connected. It's great.
As finance editor, how much have you seen tech upend the financial industry and Wall Street?
Lots. The buying and selling of securities has been revolutionized. Transferring money to friends is becoming seamless. Larger loans are available to more people at lower prices. Wall Street firms say they are tech companies, not Wall Street firms, which is not true but sounds cool. Bank employees plot crimes in digital chat rooms. Other bank employees use algorithms to catch them. Bitcoin exists.
On the other hand, despite encroachments from Facebook, Apple and others, the same oligopoly of big banks and Wall Street firms (including those that claim to be tech companies) still dominates.
You're also prolific on Twitter . What are your rules of engagement on Twitter, and what will or won't you do on the service?
I try really hard not to say stupid or bad or mean things. I do my best not to fight with people. Sometimes this is hard.
I've learned that if I have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to phrase a tweet so that it won't get me in trouble, I should just put my phone away. Similarly, if I have to ask a colleague if it's a good idea to tweet something, it isn't. This seems obvious, but it took me a while to figure it out.
I'd also like to rebut your accusation that I'm "prolific" on Twitter. I joined in August 2010 and have tweeted about 10,700 times -- an average of a bit more than three per day. Unhealthy, yes, but prolific?
So argumentative! Maybe we should talk about what tech you and your family love outside of work.
Like everyone, we are big consumers of Netflix and Amazon; we don't have cable. My wife and I are currently watching "The Good Place," which is delightful. At important moments when Boston sports teams are cruising toward championships, I subscribe to YouTube TV. We listen to podcasts and Spotify.
My boys love talking to their grandparents on FaceTime. We use WeChat to communicate with my sister and her husband, who live in China.
We've largely abandoned Facebook -- partly because of privacy concerns and partly because it's boring. We've cleansed our accounts of most pictures of our kids, and we basically use it to communicate with closed groups (to plan school events, for example). I use Facebook and Instagram to promote my work.
Have I mentioned my minivan? Sometimes on lazy weekends, we let our kids play in the Sienna by themselves. They pretend they're driving, open and close our creaky garage door, and fiddle with the settings on the front seats in mysterious ways that can take days for us to undo. Technology!
The boys also enjoy chatting with Siri and Alexa, which is a little creepy. My eldest grabs my phone, commands Siri to show him pictures of Big Ben (he was born in London) and then commands me to print them at work using The Times's fancy color printers.
What do you say to your kids about how much to use tech? What's their response?
We're very disciplined about technology in our home. We impose a strict, 15-minute limit on our kids' daily screen time. We do not use our phones in their presence.
Just kidding, we're as bad as you.
In fairness, we do try to limit screen time. But phones and tablets and "PJ Masks" are such an easy, portable way to pacify our children -- especially while we're getting ready in the morning or when we're traveling or when they're upset or when we really want them to eat dinner or when we're in public. Their silence can be precious.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: RIO RANCHO, N.M. — In what may well have been the biggest event in the history of Rio Rancho, Santa Ana Star Center was jam-packed with almost 9,000 people Monday evening for a Donald Trump campaign rally.
The City of Rio Rancho announced the following day that there were 8,704 attendees inside the Star Center; approximately 1,500 Trump supporters outside; 200 protesters, with three arrested; and about 350 law-enforcement and emergency medical responders around City Center.
President Donald Trump wants to capture New Mexico’s five electoral votes, and told the partisan crowd so. Two people were ejected late in his speech, when he quipped that the media would call that a “massive protest.”
He extolled many things that have happened nationally and in the Land of Enchantment since he took office in January 2017.
“Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for New Mexico,” he said.
Inside the Star Center
The doors to the Star Center opened earlier than the originally planned time of 4 p.m. Around 5, there were an invocation, pledge of allegiance, national anthem, plus comments from a World War II veteran, Cibola County Sheriff Tony Mace, Steve Cortez of Latinos for Trump and state GOP Chairman Steve Pearce.
Trump walked into the arena at 7:25 p.m., drawing four minutes of applause and cheers before beginning what became a 95-minute speech, occasionally interrupted with applause, cheers and well-orchestrated chants.
The floor was packed and every seat filled.
During his time at the podium, Trump made it clear he despised the Democrats and the media; he later suggested the two groups were guilty of collusion.
Trump blasted the New York Times , which had apologized Sept. 15 for a tweet that said the type of misconduct in claims against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh “may seem like harmless fun” and updated its earlier article to reflect that the woman making the allegations reportedly didn’t recall the incident.
The Times then said the tweet was “clearly inappropriate and offensive.”
“I call for the resignations of everybody at the New York Times involved,” Trump said. “They’ve broken down the ‘old gray lady’; the Times is dead.”
The bulk of media members were opposite him on the north side of the Star Center, and clearly everyone knew that, often booing and pointing at the journalists.
As for the Democrats – each time he mentioned that word, boos could be heard — he said, they “want to completely annihilate New Mexico’s economy.”
And, he noted, Democrats oppose his border wall, which he vowed would be completed by the end of 2020. About 500 miles of it have been built, he said.
“Hispanic-Americans don’t want criminals coming across the border,” he said.
Trump also said, “Your politicians have not been loyal to you; they’ve been loyal to themselves.”
Among the tidbits Trump touted as good news:

- “United States is now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world … American energy independence is what we have.”
- “We’ve created 6 million new jobs since Election Day.”
- “Unemployment recently reached its lowest rate in over 50 years.”
- “More than 7 million Americans have been limited off of food stamps.”
- “Since my election, the number of new business applications for New Mexico has increased by almost 30 percent – more than any state in the United States.”
- “The unemployment (rate) for Hispanic Americans is right now at the lowest level ever recorded … Median income for Hispanic Americans surpassed $50,000 for the first time ever.”
- “Tax cuts and reforms … (mean) a typical family of four in New Mexico making $75,000 has seen their tax bill reduced by more than $2,000.”
- “Jobs and factories are coming back home, where they belong … (If you don’t want to face tariffs), come and make your product in America; come and make your product in New Mexico.”
- “We started off with 138 (federal judges), now we’re up to 180.”
- “As a result of our non-stop efforts and millions and billions of dollars invested, last year we saw the first nationwide decline in drug overdoses – and it was a very big decline – in over three decades.”

Deemed a success
Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull termed the event flawless.
“Everybody did what they were supposed to do,” he said. … “I just want to throw kudos out to all the law-enforcement public-safety people, first responders – all of the public servants out there – that participated in making this event really what I considered flawless.
“There were a few minor incidents where we had to take some action, but we got that resolved really quickly,” he said. …. Beautiful event – a real testament to not just Rio Rancho, but all the agencies that supported us in this endeavor in hosting the president of the United States.”

Close friends, acquaintances and employees of Patrick Larkin's accused killer, 51-year-old Gregg Steele, described Steele as a man who often seemed to be teetering on the edge between boiling resentments and physical violence.
According to an arrest warrant affidavit charging him with 2nd-degree murder and three other felonies connected to the death of the popular Taos coffee shop owner, Steele confessed to crossing that threshold late last month, when he told his landlord that he shot and killed Larkin early the morning of Aug. 27 in Llano Quemado.
The landlord, who said he had rented Steele property adjacent to Larkin's over the summer, told his attorney that his tenant admitted to shooting Larkin twice with a handgun the morning of Aug. 27. He said Steele then confessed to loading the 63-year-old's body into a truck, driving it around Taos for hours and then hiding the murder weapon and a .22-rifle he stole from Larkin, according to the affidavit.
Larkin's partner and their friend, who was staying at their home on the 27th, said Larkin had left sometime before dawn that morning without waking them. A single gunshot – what sounded like the pop of a .22 rifle – startled the guest awake around 2 a.m. He went back to sleep and later assumed Larkin was firing at one of Steele’s dogs, which were known to harass Larkin’s livestock.
When Larkin never returned home, they reported him missing, and investigators found a goat that had been mauled to death in his yard. On Aug. 28, they found Larkin’s body hidden in a bush 1.5 miles away on Cuchilla Road with two gunshot wounds – one to the knee and another to the chest. An autopsy performed by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator later recovered a .45 caliber bullet from his body.
As agents canvassed the surrounding area to speak with neighbors early in the investigation, they found that Steele was the only resident not at home and who would not answer his phone.
A Taos County Sheriff’s Deputy arrested Steele just after midnight Aug. 29 for driving with an open alcohol container and resisting arrest, but Steele was released later that week. With approval from his landlord, investigators searched the area of the property where he had been living. They found that his two trailers were reported stolen and their VIN numbers had been scratched off.
The landlord later told police that he had notified Steele of the search. He said the 51-year-old was on his way home at the time, but quickly changed his route, stating he didn’t want to be involved in any “drama.” In a separate conversation, the landlord told Steele that Larkin had left his home with a rifle before he went missing, which he said Steele somehow knew was a .22-caliber weapon.
As the investigation continued, state police agents interviewed several other people in Taos County who knew Steele and said he could be dangerous.
Steele’s employees said he had told them about previous crimes he had committed in California. They said he had expressed a desire to "burn down houses of those he perceived to have wronged him," according to the affidavit. A clerk at the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office in California confirmed with the Taos News that Steele had a criminal history in the area, including three traffic violations and one misdemeanor charge for unspecified crimes.
A friend in Questa said Steele had asked him to tell police he was away from the Llano Quemado area around the time of Larkin’s death. He said Steele told him he had heared gunshots come from Larkin’s property the night of the incident and had whistled for one of his dogs to return.
Another friend from Embudo said Steele “was known to have a short fuse, and constantly talked about exacting physical revenge on those he perceived to have wronged him,” according to the affidavit.
An ex-fiancé, who separated from Steele in April and filed a restraining order against him late last year, said she had seen him pull a man from a car and beat him during a road rage incident. After they split, she said Steele forced his way into her home. She said she recorded him telling her about wanting to murder another ex-girlfriend and bury her body in the woods. She he described “how little he valued human life,” according to the affidavit.
"In interviews with nearly all of Mr. Steele's friends, and associates, multiple agents were advised that Mr. Steele was unhinged and had a propensity for violence ..." the affidavit also reads.
Following the interviews, state police seized Steele’s green Dodge pickup truck and searched it after obtaining a search warrant. Investigators said they found traces of blood in the truck bed and driver-side door that matched a sample of Larkin’s DNA and that of another unidentified person.
Steele has been known to go by a number of aliases, including Greg, Gregory and Stirling. His court cases in New Mexico are also filed under a number of different names.
People in Taos County, particularly those who knew him as the proprietor of Mountain Heritage Tree Service & Landscape Design, referred to him as Stirling. Steele’s business had been based at the northern entrance to Taos Pueblo until earlier this year, when he was “kicked off” the reservation for unspecified reasons, according to an interview with police.
A 1996 article by George Johnson of The New York Times names a "Gregory A. Steele" from Taos as one of two people who turned themselves in after starting an illegal campfire near Bandalier National Monument that sparked a major wildfire. Authorities have not confirmed whether the Steele charged in that case and the suspect in Larkin's death were one and the same.
Steele is currently incarcerated at the Taos County jail pending a no-bond motion hearing in Taos District Court set for Thursday (Sept. 19).

Texto completo: Did Brett Kavanaugh, now 54, sexually mistreat young women when he was in high school and college?
Did he then lie under oath last fall during his U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearing when he vigorously denied accusations against him and offered innocent explanations for seemingly embarrassing or incriminating entries in his high school yearbook?
I long ago made up my mind on these questions and I expect you, whether you're liberal or conservative, did as well.
If anything, the new allegation against Kavanaugh, rolled out in a curious fashion by The New York Times over the weekend, reinforced the conclusion you came to nearly a year ago about Kavanaugh's character and honesty.
And, again, no matter where you come down here, you probably agree with me that it's a pointless waste of energy now to relitigate the matter or consider new testimony seeing as there's close to no chance that he'll be forced off the bench.
One more point of presumed bipartisan consensus: The U.S. Supreme Court is a big deal. Who sits on it really matters. Court rulings have an enormous impact on our lives and on the implementation of public policy. The power to fill vacancies on the court is one of the most consequential powers a president has, particularly when he or she enjoys the support of a pliant majority in the U.S. Senate that will vote to confirm the nomination.
Republicans tend to feel this more strongly than Democrats. Even those who have grave misgivings about the character, temperament and honesty of President Donald Trump and who disagree strongly with his trade policies and his embrace of foreign despots will eagerly pull the lever for him again in the November 2020 election because he has proven to be such a reliable nominator of conservatives to lifetime seats, not just on the U.S. Supreme Court but also on the lower federal courts.
In their focus on issues -- health care, the environment, immigration, gun control, poverty, civil rights -- the Democrats usually forget to emphasize that many of their progressive plans and proposals will be doomed if the Supreme Court rules against them.
Consider what happened in 2016. Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in February of that year, and Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell refused even to hold hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy. His reason: There was a presidential election in a little more than eight months, and we should "let the people decide" who gets to nominate the next justice.
Don't think for a moment that McConnell was acting on principle. On May 28 of this year he told the Paducah (Kentucky) Area Chamber of Commerce that if a vacancy on the court opened up just before the 2020 election, Senate Republicans would help Trump fill it quickly.
Democratic candidates and officeholders ought to have banged their shoes on the table about this brazen violation of norms all year. Instead, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton barely brought it up and didn't mention the Supreme Court during her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.
Democratic voters ought to have been galvanized and outraged, on fire to get to the polls to make sure Trump and the Republicans didn't seize control of the courts. Instead, because Clinton rubbed them the wrong way or they were sore at the way the party had treated Bernie Sanders, many stayed home and sulked or voted for other-party candidates.
Republican voters, in contrast, kept their eye on the Supreme Court. Enough of them quelled their doubts about Trump to hand him a narrow Electoral College victory and the opportunity to name conservative Neil Gorsuch to replace Scalia. Trump has since installed Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court along with 148 lower court judges.
Respect. The Republican voters' resolve revealed a canny understanding that many of the planks in any party's platform might as well be made of the flimsiest balsa wood if the courts don't like them, particularly when Congress is gridlocked and the executive branch tends to govern by fiat. And that the key to stripping away abortion rights and preserving extremely permissive gun rights for generations to come is adding another vote or two to the Supreme Court.
Democrats are supposedly wising up. A September 2018 Pew Research Center poll showed 81% of Democrats view Supreme Court appointments as "very important" to their vote, compared to just 72% of Republicans. Yet the issue has barely come up in the Democratic presidential primary debates and major candidate speeches so far.
Brett Kavanaugh isn't going anywhere, no matter what a book or newspaper excerpt says about him. But as Democrats move on, I hope they are reminded by this minor news eruption of how scandalously cursory the FBI's investigation was of the claims against Kavanaugh, how outrageously the Democrats were robbed of the Scalia seat and how critical it will be for the party to keep the Supreme Court central to the campaign ahead.

Texto completo: Orange trash delay
is big government's fault
I can't think of a better example of the ineptitude of local government than the current Orange County trash collection debacle ("Garbage collection botched by storm," Sept. 10). With the looming storm two weeks ago, there was a multitude of opportunities to continue the trash collection schedule, but Orange County decided to shut down collections and close the landfill. Their inability to pivot and change scheduling is the epitome of a clunky big government response.
If you wanted to see how it should have been done, look to the large corporations, such as Publix, Costco et al. and their ability to run deliveries and keep products/services moving. That should be the exemplar of what we should expect from government, not what we are experiencing.

Learning from
history of slavery
I was reading the article entitled "The truth about American history will set us free" by Danyelle Solomon (Sept. 16) about the New York Times' 1619 Project and their focus of having slavery play a greater part in American history. Truly these people suffered, however, the heart of this article is centered on this subtle sentence, "Those bodies literally built wealth for white families and American industries, wealth that was passed down." Here is another attempt to take tax dollars to enrich a select segment of the current population. Who is trying to get wealthy on the backs of slaves now?

Castro showed
moxie with jab at Biden
Was Julian Castro disrespectful to Uncle Joe Biden during the most recent Democratic presidential debate ("Houston presidential debate winner: the Democratic Party," Sept. 14)? I thought that Castro demonstrated moxie which appears to be lacking among the Democratic field. He did not have his facts correct but he acted on what he thought he had heard.
It is not wrong or disrespectful to challenge the front runner. I think folks are a little to sensitive for Joe B. He's a seasoned politician; this should be nothing new and if he does win the nomination for the Democratic party, he is going to have take more insensitive, nasty and offensive attacks. Castro did not did play nice, but as he said, this is "an election." Democrats need to toughen up, there is no decorum when you are running against an incumbent president like Donald Trump. Get ready to rumble.

Public divide still evident when it comes to Kavanaugh

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by the Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Where the Supreme Court stands today Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.
One year ago, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate following a controversial confirmation process.

Texto completo: Vicki Schmidt and Suzanne Lindberg remember the day Brett Kavanaugh became a Supreme Court Justice like it was yesterday.
But how the Wisconsin women remember the events leading to his confirmation a year ago are starkly different.
As President Donald Trump's nominee to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh's confirmation was cruising for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee only to be rocked by allegations of sexual assault made by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford.
Outrage blew up across the political spectrum in the heightened climate of the #MeToo movement, protests flooded outside of the hearings and emotional testimonies were given by Ford followed by Kavanaugh, who forcefully denied any wrongdoing.
The events surrounding Kavanaugh's ascension to the Supreme Court manifested an already divided nation with protests lasting for weeks after the Senate narrowly voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh, who was sworn in as the court's 114th Justice on Oct. 6, 2018.
Schmidt of Oshkosh remembers the time as a low point for women's credibility.
"I am still unhappy with the results and feel that Kavanaugh's confirmation only reinforced the idea that women are not to be believed," Schmidt said. "It really horrifies me to a certain degree that we would be willing to treat women like that who are coming forward with those kind of stories."
Lindberg of De Pere had a vastly different viewpoint, saying it was a political smear campaign against an innocent man.
"I have never witnessed such a totally corrupt group that would have no limits on the lack of morals and decency that I observed during the hearings," Lindberg said. "Watching the needless suffering of his family (is) forever cemented in my mind."
Earlier this week, the New York Times published new information about sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh reigniting the feud about him. Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have called for his impeachment from the Supreme Court. Trump and several prominent Republicans came to Kavanaugh's defense.
The newspaper later ran an update to the story saying the alleged victim in the story said she did not recall the events described and refused to be interviewed.
The Women's March plans to hold a protest against Kavanaugh on the one year anniversary of his confirmation.
In the aftermath of Kavanaugh's confirmation, studies show public opinion of the Supreme Court dropped. The Pew Research Center found partisan views of the court have reached its widest gap in more than two decades.
An unscientific survey by The Post-Crescent and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin asked people how they feel about Kavanaugh's confirmation process a year out. It generated more than 400 responses from across the country.
The survey showed an even split between those who support Kavanaugh and those who oppose him.
Yet a majority shared concerns about the Supreme Court becoming too politicized in a heightened climate of partisan politics.
"Kavanaugh may or may not vote the way I would like him to, but that is beside the point," said Steve Hermes of Kimberly. "His confirmation destroyed forever the integrity of the process and thus, the integrity of an unbiased, honorable Supreme Court."
Battle heightened worries about high court's independence Ed Skerke of Neenah said the hearings made him change his personal political views and he's lost faith in the Republican Party for sticking by Kavanaugh.
"I would consider myself an independent with conservative leaning up until the Kavanaugh hearing," Skerke said. "I was so disgusted by what I saw during the hearing. The Republican Party will have to work very hard to get my vote."
Roger Vander Logt of Manitowoc County said despite being a Democrat, he was offended by the way Kavanaugh and his family were treated in the midst of the allegations.
"I will never, ever support people that do that to another human being and his or her family," Vander Logt said. "I'll never vote for another Democrat ever."
Ryan Owens, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said putting the court on party lines threatens its legitimacy.
"These hyper-partisan confirmation battles we have these days certainly are not good for the court (and) for peoples' perceptions of the court," Owens said.
Unlike other political institutions, the Supreme Court functions as an independent branch of government. With nine justices on the court appointed for life, it acts as the final arbiter of the law through interpretation of the Constitution.
Owens said when members of Congress and the president attack the court, it undermines its independence and that it's dangerous for presidential candidates to promise to appoint certain types of judges.
"Judging is supremely different than regular politicking and I think when our politicians dumb it down to us vs. them dynamic, that does the court a disservice and frankly, it does the rule of law in this country a disservice," Owens said.
Many women struck by Kavanaugh's confirmation In the wake of the allegations against Kavanaugh, women across the country took to social media platforms, revisiting their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, and using hashtags like #WhyIdidntreport to support Ford. Following Ford's allegations claiming the judge had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school, two other women accused Kavanaugh of misconduct.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed nine people and found "no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual misconduct against him.
Jane Hayes of Oshkosh said she wished an investigation into Kavanaugh's past went further than it had and called his confirmation an "insult to women everywhere."
"An appointment to the Supreme Court is for life, and should be treated more seriously than this," Hayes said.
Schmidt said she felt Ford was treated unfairly in her testimony and her own personal experiences helped her empathize with her.
"Anybody that has been a victim of sexual assault at any point at their lives and I can tell you this from my personal experience as well, it never goes away. It's there with you forever," Schmidt said. "For her to be willing to come to Washington and speak in front of the Judiciary Committee, I thought she was very brave to do so and just thought she was very poorly received."
Many women also stood by Kavanaugh and worried about what the #MeToo climate could mean for their sons and husbands.
A letter in defense of Kavanaugh's character rejecting the allegations was signed by 65 women who knew him and sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee almost immediately after the first accusation came to light.
Janice Huguet of Green Bay said the debacle reminded her of Justice Clarence Thomas's confirmation who was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill in 1991.
"Disgraceful on many levels," Huguet said. "The Democrats had a mob mentality to persecute for political partisanship that any parent that has a son should be frightened of."
Cynthia Koffman of Eden, who supports Kavanaugh, noted that the justice has made hiring women on his staff a priority.
"I'm even happier that he is on the court especially since he is the first ever to have an all-female staff," Koffman said.
Supreme Court rulings have fallen along ideological lines Alongside Kavanaugh and Thomas, members of the Supreme Court include Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch. It has a 5-4 conservative majority.
This year, the court struck down the Trump administration's plan to ask a citizenship question in the 2020 census and ruled that partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts can't be limited by federal courts, both of which fell along ideological lines.
Owens said Roberts acts as the median justice in the current court, but as a 5-4 conservative court, he doesn't expect it to function very differently than it did with Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also been more moderate than expected in his first year on the court.
"He's joined with the liberals in some cases, he's joined with the conservatives in others, but he hasn't pushed doctrine far to the right or anything at this point," Owens said. "A lot of folks, they get on the court their first year, they're a little bit quieter."
The structure of the court has also been talked about on the 2020 campaign trail with some Democratic candidates saying they would be open to expanding the number of justices on the court or proposing term limits on judges.
Whether the future of the court will play a role for voters in 2020, Owens thinks the election will more likely act as a referendum on Trump's presidency than on the makeup of the court.
"I'd say it's probably not going to be the key factor but we'll see what happens," he said.

Texto completo: The sentence came at the end of a list of White House talking points regarding the surprising departure of Jason Greenblatt, President Donald Trump's former top Middle East peace negotiator: "Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook will take on an increased role on the team."
For Middle East tea-leaf readers, Hook was the more immediately interesting story. He's the lead State Department official on Iran, and his joining the peace-brokering team suggests that the Trump administration sees containing Iran and forging peace between Israel and the Palestinians and other Arab states as of a piece.
But Berkowitz's elevation tells an even more Trumpian story: one of elevating those who are close to the family, as opposed to Washington insiders, and of a Middle East peace team that has made Israel's interests paramount in its strategies.
There isn't a ton of public knowledge about Berkowitz, a 30-year-old assistant to Jared Kushner who graduated from law school in 2016, and the critical quick-take headlines were harsh. "Trump's New Mideast Point Man Is Jared Kushner's Former Coffee Boy Avi Berkowitz," Vanity Fair wrote. And from New York magazine: "Trump Somehow Replaces Unqualified Mideast Envoy With Even Less Qualified One."
What's the story on Berkowitz (who declined an interview for this story)? Here are some facts.
He's a good friend of Kushner.
According to the most comprehensive profile to date of Berkowitz, in Business Insider in 2017, he met Kushner when Berkowitz was an undergraduate at Queens College, and they joined a pickup basketball game at a Passover retreat in Phoenix, Arizona.
They became fast friends. Berkowitz followed Kushner to the newspaper he then owned, the New York Observer, and then to the Trump campaign and subsequently the White House.
Much of his job description, at least publicly, appears to include being joined at the hip to Kushner and his wife, Trump's daughter Ivanka. Much of his Twitter feed is retweets of articles praising the two, at times accompanied by a Berkowitz addition of an emoji expressing joy.
He loves his job.
Jewish Insider reported in 2017 that Berkowitz, who had just graduated from Harvard Law, turned down a job offer at the "white shoe" law firm Gibson Dunn the previous year to join the Trump campaign crunching data.
Berkowitz appears to have no regrets: Another feature of his Twitter timeline are photos of him on the White House grounds, as well as traveling with the Kushners on the job.
It's a mutual love fest. Trump, who has posed with Berkowitz on multiple occasions for social media posts, promoted Berkowitz a year ago from special assistant to the president and assistant to the senior advisor (Kushner) to deputy assistant to the president and advisor to the senior advisor (yes, advisor to the advisor is correct).
In the arcana of federal government lingo, the leap from "assistant" to "advisor" is significant" - a transition from answering phones to shaping policy.
He's cut from the same religious and ideological cloth as Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and David Friedman.
For its first year or so, the Kushner peace team included an Arab-American woman, Dina Powell, which at least offered it the patina of diversity. Since her departure in January 2018, however, its uniformity is striking: Berkowitz, Kushner, Greenblatt and Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, were all raised in Orthodox Jewish homes, are all from the New York area, and all have deep pre-government ties to Israel and its religious institutions.
Berkowitz studied at Yeshiva Kol Torah in Jerusalem for two years. His classmate there, Rabbi Johnny Ouzzan, told Business Insider that Berkowitz would have come away understanding that the West Bank is part of "lands that religious Jews believe were part of the whole of Israel that was given to the Jewish people, starting with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob going back to the times of the Bible."
Martin Indyk, who held jobs similar to Greenblatt's under Democratic administrations, on Twitter called Berkowitz a "nice guy but does not have the weight or experience of Trump's former real estate lawyer."
That's not fair, said Matt Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
"Avi has been an integral member of this team since the beginning," Brooks said in an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. "He's been to all of the trips overseas and in all the meetings, in a high-level capacity developing the administration's plan. It's not as if, as some people assume, they plucked his resume off the shelf."
Berkowitz's rare appearances in media coverage of the peace deal suggests that he does indeed have a deep involvement. In April, Reuters reported that he was one of a handful of people who have access to the as-yet unveiled plan. In November, The New York Times reported that Berkowitz, Greenblatt and Kushner convened a private dinner of major Jewish philanthropists identified with both parties to pitch them the peace plan.
Berkowitz also was given got the seal of approval of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
"Mr. Berkowitz has a strong reputation on working on these important issues and we look forward to engaging with him in advancing the prospects for peace and reconciliation between the Israelis and the Palestinians," AIPAC spokesman Marshall Wittman said in an email.
The problem with Berkowitz, said Debra Shushan, the legislative director for Americans for Peace Now, was not his callowness but the very experiences he brought to the job.
"His religious commitment to the Greater Land of Israel is the central story," she said on Twitter.
He's sensitive to some biases, not so much to others.
Berkowitz wrote a column, bylined Avrahm Berkowitz, in Kushner's Observer chronicling the culture wars at Harvard. His advocacy led to a student apologizing for having called former Israeli parliament member Tzipi Livni "smelly" at a Harvard event.
However, Berkowitz also voiced skepticism of activists at the law school whose advocacy led to the retirement of its shield, which was a tribute to one of the school's founders, a slave owner.

Mondale, NYT reporter Savage analyze limits of presidential power

Texto completo: New York Times national security reporter Charlie Savage and former Vice President Walter Mondale had an illuminating discussion yesterday about the limits, or perhaps the limitlessness, of the power of U.S. presidents (and especially the current one) to use U.S. military power in the world without explicit congressional authorization and to use domestic spying for “national security” purposes, without constitutional authorization or oversight.
Both men are experts and have followed those issues for years, and they updated their analysis of those issues to reflect the latest (Trumpian) developments.
Speaking at the University of Minnesota’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, Savage and Mondale portrayed President Trump as operating with disregard for legal and constitutional requirements along these lines, but both also acknowledged that this is nothing new.
Mondale urged the audience to remember a time when senators of both parties were willing to put defending the constitutional allocation of powers ahead of partisan considerations, a tradition that appears to have disappeared in recent years.
Before World War II, Savage reminded the audience, the United States didn’t maintain a huge, perpetual military establishment. After each war, the nation would demobilize. But, as World War II morphed into the Cold War, the line between war and peace became ambiguous. Presidents were granted, or just assumed, vast new powers to operate, covertly and overtly, around the world and to engage in small wars and covert military actions without advance congressional approval, including the overthrow of foreign governments deemed to be on the wrong side of the Cold War.
During the Nixon years, Savage said, Congress took some measures to reassert authority over whether and when the president could use force abroad. But that trend reversed again.
Even before the Nixon years, during the J. Edgar Hoover decades at the FBI, the surveillance state got in the habit of spying, without proper legal or constitutional authority, on thousands of Americans, in the name of fighting communism or other undefinable categories of what Hoover considered “subversive” activities. These Hooverian tactics included extensive improper surveillance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Mondale said.
Hoover, whom Mondale said was “detached from reality” on the subject of King, wanted to destroy MLK and arrogated to himself the right “to pick a different leader of the civil rights movement,” Mondale said.
During his Senate career, Mondale was very active in defending the civil liberties of Americans, including the right to be free of unnecessary government surveillance. He recalled on Monday an exchange he had during an oversight hearing with Clarence Kelly, after Kelly succeeded Hoover in 1973, about the possibility that FBI surveillance threatened the rights of American citizens to privacy.
Kelly, Mondale recalled, said that “sometimes you have to give up some rights to protect others.” As Mondale described the exchange yesterday, he replied by demanding that Kelly specify “which rights” Americans would have to give up. A flustered Kelly said, “I didn’t mean it that way.”
As Savage sees it, a lot of civil liberties issues that “we thought were settled were reopened” after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, implying that a frightened America allowed President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to again start trading guarantees of freedom for promises of security.
Since then, presidents have acquired vast new executive powers, sometimes called “the imperial presidency.” “The line moves, then moves back,” he said. Some of Trump’s assertions of unprecedented presidential powers are “provoking Congress,” he said, and have sparked renewed discussions of whether and how executive authority in such areas might need to be restrained.
For example, Savage asked, does President Trump have the power, without a congressional declaration of war or any other clear authorization from Congress, to order U.S. bombing of sites in Iran that Trump believes are part of a program to develop an Iranian nuclear weapon?
Whether you think such a bombing mission would be good or bad, you would have to acknowledge that such a pre-emptive strike, which would probably kill Iranians, without prior congressional authorization, would seem to violate the constitutional provision that gives Congress the power to declare war. This is just me talking, but it seems the obvious context for the point Savage (and Mondale) were discussing.
The Constitution gives Congress the sole power “to declare war.” If the United States can bomb a country on which Congress has not declared war, or perhaps explicitly authorized an attack, what meaning is left to the constitutional provision that assigns war-declaring power to that branch?
Savage noted that Attorney General William Barr has, at least in the past, taken the position that such an order from the president, without advance congressional approval, would be legal.
Mondale disagreed with that view (and a plain reading of the constitutional provision on declaration seems to agree with Mondale). He said yesterday: “I think the Constitution expects a president who wants to start a war has to come to Congress for authority to do so. Our founders wanted that to be part of the division of powers. … I think we should not allow a president to redefine the Constitution on war powers. … You should have to go to Congress for that authority, and we’ll all be better off if we do.”
Mondale just sort of stuck up for quaint idea of obeying the Constitution, allowing U.S. democracy to work the way it was designed.
I wish I shared his confidence, but I’ll give him the last word. Professor Lawrence Jacobs, who moderated the discussion, asked whether he thought democracy is in retreat. Said Mondale, pretty forcefully:
“No, I keep hearing these doomsday guesses about where democracy is heading. I think there’s every reason to feel optimistic about it.”

Gitmo costs $13M per prisoner

Texto completo: Headnote With only 40 detainees, annual cost is $540M and rising
GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba - Holding Nazi war criminal Rudolf Hess as the lone prisoner in Germany's Spandau Prison in 1985 cost an estimated $1.5 million in today's dollars. The per-prisoner bill in 2012 at the "supermax" facility in Colorado, home to some of the highest-risk prisoners in the United States, was $78,000.
Then there is Guantanamo Bay, where the expense now works out to about $13 million for each of the 40 prisoners being held there.
According to a tally by The New York Times, the total cost last year of holding the prisoners - including the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks - paying for the troops who guard them, running the war court and doing related construction, exceeded $540 million.
The $13 million per prisoner cost almost certainly makes Guantánamo the world's most expensive detention program. And nearly 18 years after the George W. Bush administration took a crude compound called Camp X-Ray and hastily established it as a holding station for enemy fighters picked up in the war on terrorism, it has taken on a sprawling and permanent feel, with the expense most likely to continue far into the future.
Because of the relative isolation of its location on a U.S. Navy base on Cuba's southeast coast, the military assigns around 1,800 troops to the detention center, or 45 for each prisoner. The troops work out of three prison buildings, two top-secret headquarters, at least three clinics and two compounds where prisoners consult their lawyers. Some also stand guard across the base at Camp Justice, the site of the war court and parole board hearing room.
The prison's staff members have their own chapel and cinema, housing, two dining rooms and a team of mental health care workers, who offer comfort dogs.
Judges, lawyers, journalists and support workers are flown in and out on weekly shuttles.
The 40 prisoners, all men, get halal food, access to satellite news and sports channels, workout equipment and PlayStations. These who behave - and that has been the majority for years - get communal meals and can pray in groups, and some can attend art and horticulture classes.
The estimated annual cost of $540 million covers the 12-month period that ended last Sept. 30 and does not include expenses that have remained classified, presumably including a continued CIA presence. But the figures show that running the range of facilities built up over the years has grown increasingly expensive even as the number of prisoners has declined.
A Defense Department report in 2013 calculated the annual cost of operating Guantánamo Bay's prison and court system at $454.1 million, or nearly $90 million less than last year. At the time, there were 166 prisoners at Guantánamo, making the per-prisoner cost $2.7 million.
The 2013 report put the total cost of building and operating the prison since 2002 at $5.2 billion through 2014, a figure that now appears to have risen to past $7 billion.
Guantánamo Bay, said Capt. Brian L. Mizer, a Navy lawyer who has represented detainees at the prison across a decade, has "America's tiniest boutique prison, reserved exclusively for alleged geriatric jihadists."
Guantánamo has held a cumulative total of about 770 foreign men and boys as wartime prisoners at different times, with the prison population peaking at 677 in 2003. The last prisoner to arrive came in 2008.
The Bush administration released about 540 of the detainees, mostly by repatriating them to Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. Then the Obama administration released another 200 through third-country resettlement or repatriation. President Donald Trump ran for office on a promise to keep the prison open and possibly send more "bad dudes" there, though no one new has arrived since he took office.

Paul Krugman: Republicans do not believe in Democracy

Texto completo: Item: Last week Republicans in the North Carolina House used the occasion of 9/11 to call a surprise vote, passing a budget bill with a supermajority to override the Democratic governor’s veto. They were able to do this only because most Democrats were absent, some of them attending commemorative events; the Democratic leader had advised members that they didn’t need to be present because, he says, he was assured there would be no votes that morning.
Item: Also last week, Rep. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a subpoena to the acting director of national intelligence, who has refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint that the intelligence community’s inspector general found credible and of “urgent concern.” We don’t know what the whistleblower was warning about, but we do know that the law is clear: Such complaints must be referred to Congress, no exceptions allowed.
On the surface, these stories may seem to be about very different things. The fight in North Carolina is basically about the GOP’s determination to deny health care to low-income Americans; the governor had threatened to veto any budget that didn’t expand Medicaid. The whistleblower affair probably involves malfeasance by high government officials, quite possibly President Donald Trump, that in some way threatens national security.
What the stories have in common, however, is that they illustrate contempt for democracy and constitutional government. Elections are supposed to have consequences, conveying power to the winners. But when Democrats win an election, the modern GOP does its best to negate the results, flouting norms and, if necessary, the law to carry on as if the voters hadn’t spoken.
Thus, in 2016, the voters of North Carolina chose a Democrat to govern the state; the immediate GOP response was to try to strip away most of the governor’s power. Last year Democrats won a majority of the votes for the state legislature, too, although Republicans retained control thanks to extreme gerrymandering. But they no longer have a veto-proof majority — hence last week’s power grab.
Similarly, last year America’s voters chose to give Democrats control of the House of Representatives. This still leaves Democrats without the ability to pass legislation, since Republicans control the Senate and the White House. But the House, by law, has important additional powers — the right to be informed of what’s going on in the executive branch, such as complaints by whistleblowers, and the right to issue subpoenas demanding information relevant to governing.
The Trump administration, however, has evidently decided that none of that matters. So what if Democrats demand information they’re legally entitled to? So what if they issue subpoenas? After all, law enforcement has to be carried out by the Justice Department — and under William Barr, Justice has effectively become just another arm of the GOP.
This is the context in which you want to think about the latest round of revelations about Brett Kavanaugh.
First of all, we now know that the FBI, essentially at Republican direction, severely limited its investigation into Kavanaugh’s past. So Kavanaugh was appointed to a powerful, lifetime position without a true vetting.
Second, both Kavanaugh’s background and the circumstances of his appointment suggest that Mitch McConnell went to unprecedented lengths to create a Republican bloc on the Supreme Court that will thwart anything and everything Democrats try to accomplish, even if they do manage to take both Congress and the White House. In particular, as The Washington Post’s Greg Sargent notes, it seems extremely likely that this court will block any meaningful action on climate change.
What can Democrats do about this situation? They need to win elections, but all too often that won’t be sufficient, because they confront a Republican Party that at a basic level doesn’t accept their right to govern, never mind what the voters say. So winning isn’t enough; they also have to be prepared for that confrontation.
And surely the first step is recognizing the problem exists. Which brings me to the Democratic presidential primary race.
The leading candidates for the Democratic nomination differ considerably in both their personalities and their policy proposals, but these pale beside their differences from Trump and his party. All of them are decent human beings; all would, if given the chance, move America in a notably more progressive direction.
The real chasm between the candidates is, instead, in the extent to which they get it — that is, the extent to which they understand what they’re facing in the modern GOP.
The big problem with Joe Biden, still the front-runner, is that he obviously doesn’t get it. He’s made it clear on many occasions that he considers Trump an aberration and believes that he could have productive, amicable relations with Republicans once Trump is gone.
Which raises the question: Even if Biden can win, is he too oblivious to govern effectively?

Texto completo: Las páginas en español del New York Times llegaron a su fin este martes.
El periódico anunció que cerró el proyecto lanzado de manera autónoma en 2016. La imposibilidad de monetizarlo obligó a la medida.
“ Lanzamos NYT en Español como parte de un experimento que expandió nuestra cobertura a diferentes idiomas, en un intento de alcanzar y atraer más lectores internacionales”, dijo el periódico en una nota editorial. “Si bien el sitio Español atrajo a una considerable nueva audiencia hacia nuestro periodismo, y produjo regularmente artículos de los cuales estamos orgullosos, no demostró ser financieramente exitoso”.
El medio publicaba artículos en español tanto originales como traducciones de los grandes reportajes de su edición principal. Entre los colaboradores estaban reconocidos autores como Martín Caparrós y Jorge Carrión .
El New York Times en Español tenía una redacción en Ciudad de México. El diario aclaró que se seguirán traduciendo artículos y que se mantendrá activa la dirección www.nytimes.com/es.
Los periodistas de la redacción lamentaron el fin del proyecto.
“Ha sido un camino de mucho aprendizaje y, como bien lo dijo Patricia Nieto, no podría estar mejor acompañada en este periplo. Sigo creyendo que escribir en español siempre es un buen negocio… y el tiempo lo dirá”, escribió Paulina Chavira en Twitter.

Thousands more Jeffrey Epsteins are still out there

Texto completo: Jeffrey Epstein got away for years with raping underage girls, and the public is properly outraged that powerful people seemed to shrug and let him off easy.
But the problem isn't one tycoon but many tens of thousands of men who pay for sex with underage girls across the country. And society as a whole reacts with the same indifference that authorities showed in the Epstein scandal.
"We see it as this singular narrative about this one guy," said Rachel Lloyd, who wrote a superb book, "Girls Like Us," about her own experience being sexually trafficked as a teenager. "There's a much larger narrative out there about girls, often girls of color, who are commercially sexually exploited, often with impunity.
"It's part of the same behavior, part of what we allow as a society," Lloyd added. "He got away with it because society said he could, and that's what other johns think as well."
Lloyd now runs a first-rate program, GEMS, in New York for girls and young women who have been trafficked. The people she helps haven't been whisked off to Caribbean islands on private jets, but the pattern is the same: sordid exploitation of vulnerable girls by older and more affluent men who get away with it.
Indeed, girls across the U.S. are often treated even worse than in the Epstein case: Some end up arrested for prostitution while their rapists get off scot-free.
If we want to channel our outrage at the Epstein case in a productive way, we could: A) ramp up prosecution of pimps who traffic children; B) prosecute johns who rape girls and boys; C) assist programs for survivors of trafficking; and D) support initiatives that help vulnerable youths avoid being victimized by predators.
"They're not billionaires, but it happens all the time," said Shelia Faye Simpkins, who ran away from home at 14 and into the arms of a pimp.
She was raised by an alcoholic who was addicted to drugs and taught her, when she was 6, how to perform oral sex on a man. Simpkins said intervention by social workers might have spared her a brutal career being beaten by a pimp when she didn't earn a daily quota of $1,000.
She estimates that over the years she was arrested about 200 times for prostitution and other offenses; her pimp, never.
Eventually, Simpkins escaped that life and now works with an outstanding program in Tennessee called Thistle Farms that helps exploited women start new lives and find employment.
As world leaders prepare to gather at the United Nations, some 40 million people are effectively locked into modern forms of slavery, according to the Global Slavery Index. That includes sex trafficking but also child marriages and a great deal of forced labor.
In the United States, no one knows exactly how many children are sold for sex, but estimates have run between 10,000 and 100,000 in any given year. Whatever the number, it's too many.
President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump have both denounced sex trafficking, with the president saying he will leverage "every resource" to address this "urgent humanitarian issue." Ivanka Trump has said that fighting trafficking is a major priority of her father's administration.
But while the attention is welcome, it seems to be largely hot air - and Trump's lurid descriptions of trafficking seem mostly to be a misleading rationale for his border wall. In fact, under Trump, the federal government is easing up on human traffickers.
Federal prosecutors initiated only 171 human trafficking cases last year, substantially fewer than the 241 in 2017 or the 223 in 2016, according to the Federal Human Trafficking Report series. Bradley Myles of Polaris, the organization that runs a human trafficking hotline, (888) 373-7888, notes that the number of T visas, which are given to trafficking victims, has also dropped, and a housing program for trafficking survivors has been canceled.
"I'm glad the issue has bipartisan support, but I don't think enough is happening," Myles said. "Epstein wasn't this one bad apple; this is more of a systemic issue."
If we could leverage outrage, there's evidence of what works abroad and in the U.S. A group called the Freedom Fund has a report coming out this month showing that expanding grassroots initiatives could lead to huge reductions in forced labor in India.
Likewise, new studies of My Life My Choice, a Boston program for children who have been trafficked or are at risk of being trafficked, find that the girls become less likely to use drugs, engage in delinquent behavior or be arrested when provided counseling, mentoring and other support. The program's participants on average were first sexually exploited at the age of 14 which should remind us that we need more help for vulnerable children, and less impunity for pimps and johns who exploit them.
"What was so painful about the Jeffrey Epstein case is that it wasn't shocking," Lisa Goldblatt Grace, co-founder of My Life My Choice, told me. "A wealthy white man leveraged his money, privilege and power to sexually abuse, to rape, young girls."
Or, as Yiota Souras of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children put it: "Epstein is the tip of a very large iceberg."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Explosive revelations that the FBI never interviewed witnesses in one of the sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is prompting the House Judiciary Committee to consider options for addressing the lapse, at a minimum grilling FBI Director Christopher Wray about it next month, a committee source told the Daily News.
According to a forthcoming book on Kavanaugh and his controversial confirmation in the Senate, the FBI interviewed Deborah Ramirez about her charge that the future judge exposed himself to her at a college party. But the bureau never followed up with witnesses.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh adamantly denied Ramirez's claims, as well as those levied by Christine Blasey Ford that he assaulted her in high school.
Kavanaugh argued that if he'd exposed himself to the religious freshman Ramirez, it would have been the talk of Yale.
The new book by New York Times reporters suggests the incident probably was widely discussed, and reveals witnesses who back Ramirez's version of events, as well as the fact that dozens of people offered tips to the FBI that were not pursued.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler told WNYC on Monday morning that the issue would not be fodder for a new impeachment probe against Kavanaugh while the committee was busy investigating President Trump.
But a Judiciary Committee aide said Nadler (D-Manhattan, Brooklyn) would question Wray at its October hearing to see if the administration tried to sway the bureau's work.
"We will question Wray on their investigation and whether the White House pressured them," the aide said.
"That would be a potential abuse of power and relevant for our larger work."
The committee's larger work these days is not just oversight of the FBI, but investigating whether to recommend impeaching Trump.
Nadler also told WNYC's Brian Lehrer the Wray hearing could be of great interest to the Senate.
"These deeds that [Kavanaugh] allegedly did years ago would be very relevant to a senator voting for or against his nomination," Nadler said.
Progressive activists have been pushing Nadler since the spring to get more aggressive with Kavanaugh, demanding that Nadler obtain millions of documents from the National Archives concerning Kavanaugh's past White House work.
Nadler requested the documents this summer, but told The News recently that he has not received any of the records yet.
Activists have also been hammering to dig back into the Kavanaugh probe, which, despite Nadler's downplaying the possibility Monday, looks more likely now, if only in relation to possible tampering by the White House.
While Nadler brushed off the idea of a Supreme Court impeachment, the new revelations have sparked calls for it.
Brian Fallon, who runs the liberal judicial activist group Demand Justice, argued that Congress should at least be looking at whether Kavanaugh lied under oath about misbehavior, whether the National Archives documents reveal any lies about his White House work, and why the FBI investigation stopped short, among other other issues.
"You have multiple tacks that ought to be investigated, any of which could be a basis for impeachment or a referral to the Justice Department," Fallon said.
"Even if they won't take a vote to launch an impeachment proceeding, they damn well better pursue all theses lines of inquires - you shouldn't rule out an impeachment proceeding until you've pursued all of this."
Nadler's primary opponent, Lindsey Boylan, called for impeachment over the weekend.

Senators Urge F.C.C. to Review 2 Chinese Telecoms

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Senate's top Democrat plans on Monday to ask the Federal Communications Commission to consider whether two major Chinese telecommunications companies should be barred from operating in the United States.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, along with Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, will cite national security concerns in a letter asking the commission to review the licenses that give the two companies, China Telecom and China Unicom, the right to use networks in the United States.
In the letter, they will say that the two Chinese government-linked telecom operators could use that access to "target" Americans' communications. And they will warn that the companies could reroute communications traveling on their networks through China. The text of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.
The request by the two senators shows how leaders in Congress are willing to apply more pressure to Chinese technology firms even as President Trump seems open to pulling back on some of the restrictions as part of the trade negotiations with China. The focus on two previously untouched firms shows that efforts to restrict Chinese technology firms are expanding.
China Telecom denied that it represents a national security threat to the United States.
"We make the protection of our customers' data a priority, and have built a solid reputation as one of the best telecom companies in the world," said Ge Yu, a spokesman for China Telecom's Americas subsidiary, adding that the company is proud of "maintaining a good standing with all regulatory agencies."
China Unicom did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, Washington has levied $ 360 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, moved to block the ability of American companies to export their technology to China and tried to stop certain products linked to the Chinese government from being sold in America.
National security officials have been worried for years that the Chinese government could use its companies to gain access to crucial telecommunications infrastructure. Those concerns have become more prominent as carriers in the United States and in China race to launch next-generation 5G wireless networks -- and American regulators have targeted Chinese telecom companies in the name of security.
In May the F.C.C. denied an application from China Mobile to operate in the United States. Ajit Pai, the commission's chairman, said at the time that there was a risk that the Chinese state would use the carrier to "conduct activities that would seriously jeopardize the national security, law enforcement, and economic interests of the United States."
But China Unicom and China Telecom have retained the ability to operate in the United States. Both have licenses that were granted by the F.C.C. in the early 2000s, and some regulators have said that they should be re-examined even though the companies are smaller than China Mobile.
Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner on the F.C.C., said in May that the agency should go "even further" than denying China Mobile's application and look at the other two companies. A Democrat on the commission, Geoffrey Starks, said that the "national security environment has changed" since the firms were allowed access to networks in the United States.
Mr. Schumer and Mr. Cotton will echo those concerns in their letter, saying that "the evolving national security environment and increased knowledge of the Chinese government's role in economic and other forms of espionage" requires a re-examination of licenses belonging to any state-controlled Chinese telecom company
Some experts disagreed with the idea that cutting off China Unicom and China Telecom would protect national security, in part because they largely serve companies that do business in China as well as some Chinese consumers in the United States.
"They're not operating in the sense of a Bell company, or a T-Mobile, or a Verizon; they don't compete in the U.S.," said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "I think it's overblown."
Revoking the licenses would be the latest way the United States has tried to check China's tech sector since Mr. Trump's 2017 inauguration.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the panel that vets deals between American and foreign firms, said in 2018 that the acquisition of the chip maker Qualcomm by then Singapore-based Broadcom could limit America's ability to compete. The same panel demanded this year that a Chinese gaming company sell the gay dating app Grindr.
The administration has been especially aggressive in cutting off Chinese telecom companies' access to American customers. It banned the networking manufacturer ZTE from buying American products in 2018. Earlier this year, it placed Huawei on a Commerce Department list of companies to which American companies cannot export goods.
Some of the Huawei restrictions are expected to take effect in November, but the White House has reconsidered its Chinese telecom restrictions under pressure from American companies and the Chinese government during on-again, off-again trade negotiations.
After China's president, Xi Jinping, appealed on the company's behalf, Mr. Trump interceded with his administration to reverse the ZTE ban. In trade negotiations this summer, the administration appeared willing to back down from some of the restrictions it had placed on Huawei.
Lawmakers have been taking their own steps to put pressure on the companies.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has expressed interest in expediting consideration of a resolution declaring that Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE pose a national security threat to the United States, according to a congressional aide with direct knowledge of the matter.
Such requests can be blocked if a senator objects. A spokesman for Mr. McConnell, David Popp, declined to comment.
But a nonbinding resolution is unlikely to satisfy lawmakers in both chambers, including Mr. Schumer, who are trying to make sure that language giving Congress more oversight over some of the Huawei restrictions is included in the upcoming military spending bill.
"If we're serious about this, we need to have something with teeth," said Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland. "Making a statement may have symbolic importance but it does nothing to address the real issues."

'Unfit to sit': Progressive organizations that disrupted Kavanaugh hearings demand his impeachment

Texto completo: Liberal activist organizations that featured prominently in disrupting Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings a year ago called for the Supreme Court justice to be impeached in the wake of a resurfaced sexual misconduct allegation against him.
"The evidence that Kavanaugh committed perjury in his Senate testimony is mounting. Brett Kavanaugh is unfit to sit as a Supreme Court justice in the face of so many credible allegations that he sexually assaulted these women. House Democrats must not delay in launching an impeachment probe," the statement read, which was issued jointly by Women's March, Center for Popular Democracy, and Demand Justice.
"This new report corroborates the allegations made by Debbie Ramirez and proves the FBI investigation conducted last year was a sham from the start," they continued. "At this point, an impeachment inquiry in the House is the only appropriate way to conduct the fact-finding that Senate Republicans refused to conduct." The groups urged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler to begin an impeachment inquiry against Kavanaugh, a sentiment that several 2020 Democrats have echoed.
Women's March and the Center for Popular Democracy formed the nexus of the coalition that sought to derail Kavanaugh's confirmation last fall. The continuous outbursts that disrupted the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings were intended as acts of "civil disobedience," according to reporters with the Daily Caller News Foundation who listened in on a conference call among the activists last year. The groups, which are funded by wealthy liberals and organizations such as Planned Parenthood, offered cash to some of the protesters who were arrested to cover their post-and-forfeits, according to the conference call. The groups plan to mark the one-year anniversary of Kavanaugh's Oct. 6 confirmation with protests in Washington, D.C.
The New York Times published an additional allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh on Saturday, in which a male classmate at Yale claims he "saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student." The claim was similar to that of Deborah Ramirez, who claimed Kavanaugh thrust his penis into her face during a drunken college party. Kavanaugh has denied that he is guilty of any of these sex crimes. President Trump accused "Radical Left Democrats" on Sunday of colluding with the "LameStream media" in trying to destroy Kavanaugh, and publicly urged him to "start suing for libel."

For Sunday’s concert, SoundSpace brings in musicians such as Jose Villalobos, House of Kenzo and Block Party Collective to perform pieces around the museum related to Gibson’s multifaceted influences.
3. La Condesa’s El Grito Celebration
6 p.m. Sept. 16. $25.
Malverde, 400-B W. Second St.
elgritoatmalverde.splashthat.com
Texas takes a lot of pride in being Texas, but what would Austin’s food scene be without our neighbors to the south? To celebrate Mexican Independence Day, La Condesa’s executive chef Rick Lopez is bringing fellow veterans of New York City’s Café Boulud to Austin — namely, chefs Aaron Bludorn and Drake Leonards. They will come together for a real-time breakdown of fish and serve up fresh ceviche. The party will also have mezcal tastings, a make-your-own-tortilla station and DJ beats.
4. William Tyler, Little Mazarn at 3Ten
8 p.m. Sept. 17. $15-$18.
310 Willie Nelson Blvd.
3tenaustin.com
What good deed did Austin guitar fans do to warrant visits by both Bill Frisell and William Tyler within a four-day span? Tyler, from Nashville, is in some ways like a younger version of Frisell, an exquisitely tasteful instrumental composer who brings a broad range of American musical forms into his acoustic-based sound. A major bonus on this bill is local duo Little Mazarn, whose minimalist banjo-saw explorations cast similarly enchanting spells. — Peter Blackstock

Texto completo: Politics and Christianity are increasingly strange bedfellows, and best-selling Christian author and activist Jim Wallis has taken note.
As the author of the megaselling "God’s Politics" in 2006, Wallis now is adding his thoughts on the divided nature of our country in his new book, "Christ in Crisis: Why We Need to Reclaim Jesus."
Wallis will share his book at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 15, at Naperville’s Community Christian Church, 1635 Emerson Lane. Event tickets are sold exclusively at JimWallisAndersons.brownpapertickets.com.
The presentation is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop in downtown Naperville.
In his book, Wallis, a New York Times bestselling author and Christian activist, urges America to return to the tenets of Jesus as the means to save us from the polarizing bitterness and anger of our tribal nation.
Building on "Reclaiming Jesus" — the declaration he and other church leaders wrote in May 2018 to address America’s current crisis — Wallis argues Christians have become disconnected from Jesus and need to revisit their spiritual foundations. By pointing to eight questions Jesus asked or is asked, Wallis provides a means to measure whether we are truly aligned with the moral and spiritual foundations of our Christian faith.
"Christians have often remembered, rediscovered, and returned to their obedient discipleship of Jesus Christ — both personal and public — in times of trouble. It’s called coming home," Wallis says.
Wallis is a leading figure at the crossroads of religion and politics in America today, the author of eight books, and the founder of Sojourners, a global faith and justice network. He is a public theologian, a speaker and preacher and a faith-based activist.

Dumbo's Past and Present, Bridged by Irresistible Views

Texto completo: The view of the Manhattan Bridge from Dumbo has become so Instagram-famous that it has entered the realm of the Eiffel Tower and latte foam: People take pictures of it because people take pictures of it.
Walter Benjamin, the German culture critic who famously warned that artworks lose their "aura" when they're reproduced endlessly, may not be spinning in his grave, but he is almost certainly chain-smoking down there.
And yet, improbably, that particular view from Brooklyn still feels like an artwork when you encounter it in person. When you turn from Water Street onto Washington Street and the bridge suddenly rises up, it's an arresting, pulse-quickening sight, like the scene in sci-fi movies where you first glimpse a little -- just a little -- of the huge monster or alien as it scuttles between buildings. You can even see the Empire State Building across the East River, small as a souvenir, between the bridge's pillars. In another context that might be the whole show. But because of the scale of the vision before you here, it's just a grace note.
The view of Manhattan has made Dumbo a tourist destination in recent years. But back when the neighborhood was in its infancy, it was sufficiently sketchy that Instagrammers, had they existed, would have stayed in their beach chairs taking pictures of their feet. Doreen Gallo, who paints and makes mosaic installations, and who serves as the director of the Dumbo Neighborhood Alliance, remembers getting a visit from a prominent art dealer early on. "In 1984, Holly Solomon came to my studio," she said. "She paid the cabdriver $ 50 to keep the cab running and told him she'd give him another $ 50 if he was still there when she came out. That's how people were about Dumbo."
The story goes that the acronym Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, was dreamed up in 1978 by artists who hoped a weird name would keep developers at bay. According to Crane Davis, who brainstormed the moniker over beers with the other members of the "naming committee," the second choice was Danya, for District Around the Navy Yard Annex. Dumbo won, apparently, because it was dumber.
As in SoHo years earlier, artists made a desolate industrial area their own, living and working in raw, sprawling lofts in buildings that had formerly been warehouses and factories dating as far back as the 19th century. Predictably, developers did not stay away. As more moneyed residents moved in, they brought both extravagances and important amenities, such as giant glass condos, artisanal chocolate and schools. Eventually it was safe to walk home at night from the F train. Dumbo's proximity to Manhattan and the waterfront was a major draw. And, it seemed as if the neighborhood could actually deliver on the contradictory dream that even nonrich New Yorkers never quite give up on: to live in a dense, humming community and still have an apartment bigger than a porta-potty.
Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, a professor at the University of Southern California and the author of "The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class," suggested another reason the upwardly mobile were drawn to neighborhoods like Dumbo and SoHo: They sensed that the artists were building a genuine unscripted life there.
"The artists allowed us to rethink the industrial architecture in a way that we never would have before," she said. "Suddenly, it makes sense, and we're like, 'Oh, yes, high ceilings and light and big windows!' People can't always articulate their motivations for the things they covet, and I'm not sure that the person with the $ 15 million apartment can say, 'It's because of aesthetics, and it relates to bohemianism, and it's a whack against the standardization of houses from the 20th century.' They'll just say, 'I like it.' But somewhere the genesis of that is the artist moving in and changing what we think is attractive."
Today, Dumbo is a hub for tech companies, and the average home is worth just over $ 1.5 million. (The $ 15 million apartment that Ms. Currid-Halkett referred to is the triplex penthouse in the clock tower building on the Dumbo waterfront.) The area is unlikely to return to its roots, but the neighborhood alliance still battles developers and city agencies to preserve its history as much as possible. Ms. Gallo, the director, appears to feel every incursion on the original streetscapes viscerally. "It's about our industrial waterfront," she said. "It's about our immigrant history."
One thing that pains her is the callousness with which the Belgian blocks that pave the streets are treated when the city undertakes improvements or utility companies do a dig. Ms. Gallo sent The New York Times a half-dozen photographs that depict the stones having been restored so halfheartedly after various excavations that the restorations almost look sarcastic. Making the blocks by hand is a lost art, she noted. Ms. Gallo said she wished she could put "the decision makers" in a room and give them a hammer, a chisel, and a slab of marble or granite; she would tell them they had to make one before they could remove even one more from the ground.
More reconstruction is planned for years to come. Ms. Gallo is apprehensive about that, and, though she has made Dumbo her home for 35 years, she sometimes wonders why people keep moving there. "These people living in the $ 5 million apartments want to go to the overcrowded public school?" she asked. "They want to live in a construction zone? I don't get it. I really don't. I guess it's the cache of living in Dumbo."
Ms. Gallo paused, then said something that applied both to residents and to the Instagrammers who keep trooping in: "I guess they're doing it for the view?"
Photograph Construction around the Brooklyn Bridge, top left in 1952 and above left after renovations in 1959, changed the neighborhood, and artists in the 1970s were attracted to the low cost of living and loft spaces near abandoned warehouses, like the vacant area at right in 1972, with views of the Manhattan Bridge. "It's about our industrial waterfront," said Elizabeth Currid-Halkett. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY NIK KLEINBERG; EDDIE HAUSNER/THE NEW YORK TIMES; KEITH MEYERS/THE NEW YORK TIMES; BARTON SILVERMAN/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A22-A23); The neighborhood changed quickly in the 1970s as spectacular views like the one from a movie set, top right, and a Water Street apartment, far right, drew young people to the neighborhood and new bars and restaurants like Bankside Boon Dock, above right, opened in former industrial areas. The name Dumbo was chosen in 1978 to try to keep developers away. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ROBERT LEVIN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; DONAL F. HOLWAY/THE NEW YORK TIMES; NANCY MORAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A23)

Texto completo: After writing 195 books — with another in progress — New York Times bestselling author Jerry B. Jenkins will be among 21 authors who make up the first class of inductees into the Colorado Authors Hall of Fame.
The Black Forest-based writer, known most notably for co-authoring the “Left Behind” Christian book series, will be honored Saturday in a ceremony at the Courtyard Marriott Cherry Creek in Denver. Other inductees include the late Western novelist Louis L’Amour, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, celebrated Colorado photographer John Fielder and horror novelist (and Jenkins’ personal friend, with whom he appeared on the cover of Writer’s Digest in 2009) Stephen King, who wrote “The Shining” in Colorado.
Jenkins’ induction is only the latest honor in a 40-year career full of them.
A self-proclaimed “sports freak,” the Michigan native took quick interest in sports, reading the sports sections in newspapers and Sports Illustrated.
“I wrote imaginary sports stories as if I had covered real games, just for fun,” he said.
At 14, he hoodwinked his way into a job as a sports reporter.
“I went to the ... sports department and asked how they were fixed for sportswriters, ‘because I am one.’ I looked older than I was, and the sports editor tried me out by assigning me to cover a couple of high school football games, not realizing that I wasn’t even old enough to drive yet,” Jenkins said.
He made “$1 per inch that survived the editor’s cuts,” he said.
Jenkins later became sports editor until he was 22 and then worked as a magazine editor and publisher until he was 31. After that, he served as head of Moody Press, eventually becoming vice president for publishing for the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago.
“At 40, I’d written nearly 100 books and went full-time freelance,” he said.
“Left Behind” was his 125th book. The 16-novel series, published in 1995, is set in the contemporary era and tells the story of the end times: the pretribulation, premillennial Christian eschatological interpretation of the Biblical apocalypse. The series has been adapted into four films and has spawned four video games, a soundtrack album and graphic novels.
Jenkins said the idea for the novels came from his co-author, Tim LaHaye, “but he was not a fiction writer. I got the fun part.” LaHaye died in 2016.
At its peak, the first book in the series alone was averaging 275,000 sales per month.
Jenkins’ career includes works in many genres, from mysteries, romance novels and children’s adventures to Christian fiction, biographies and marriage and family titles.
Jenkins and his wife, Dianna, moved to Black Forest in 1999. He’s been named to the New York Times bestseller list 21 times — seven works debuted at No. 1 — with more than 70 million copies sold.

Texto completo: The appearances are appalling. If the California Horse Racing Board concealed the positive drug test of a Triple Crown winner throughout his Triple Crown campaign, that's going to be terribly tough to Justify.
If Bob Baffert's prize colt failed a drug test more than two weeks before winning the 2018 Kentucky Derby, as the New York Times' Joe Drape reported Wednesday, and an independent lab confirmed the result three days after the race, keeping it quiet suggests a cover-up, a conspiracy and another black eye for a badly bruised sport.
Instead of being disqulified from the Santa Anita Derby and therefore ineligible for the Derby, Justify swept the 3-year-old classics and was retired to stud more than a year before Drape's report that he had run his final Derby prep on 300 nanograms of scopolamine
Whatever the rationale for keeping that quiet, however the CHRB will spin its procedures and its concern for due process, this looks like another case of an industry hiding its dirty laundry at a time it ought to be embracing transparency. It looks awful.
"This nasty cover-up has cheated the betting public and the true winners of the Santa Anita and Kentucky derbies," PETA Vice President Kathy Guillermo said, almost on cue. "... Even worse, Bob Baffert apparently drugged and harmed Justify – a horse who was completely at his mercy. Baffert should be suspended and held accountable, and Justify should be disqualified from the Triple Crown victory. Even at the highest levels, horseracing is crooked to the core and must be overhauled."
Overheated rhetoric aside, thoroughbred racing cannot be trusted to police itself. It cannot continue to be regulated by insiders inclined to protect the industry's short-term interests over its long-term integrity. A cover-up that spanned the entirety of the 2018 Triple Crown campaign makes a persuasive closing argument for independent national oversight of a sport too clubby and secretive for its own good; one that continues to struggle at staying out of its own way.
What happened here makes the 2019 Kentucky Derby disqualification of Maximum Security seem as innocent as a split infinitive. It bespeaks the kind of backroom dealings and short-sighted leadership up with which we should not put.
Perhaps there is a plausible and reasonable explanation for Justify testing positive. Perhaps, as the CHRB decided/rationalized, Justify's drug test could have been the result of his eating contaminated food prior to the Santa Anita Derby. Perhaps, in order to allow investigation and deliberations to run their normal course, regulators felt an obligation to proceed with caution befitting a horse of historic significance.
Yet when CHRB executive director Rick Baedeker notified his board members three days after the Derby that a complaint would be issued and a hearing scheduled, his failure to follow through invites suspicion. That CHRB chairman Chuck Winner owns a piece of some horses in Baffert's barn is an obvious conflict of interest.
Maybe everyone involved is entirely honorable, scrupulous and objective. Still, the whole thing looks lousy. Whenever industry insiders double as regulators, their ability to render arm's-length decisions is inherently compromised. When they make significant decisions behind closed doors and neglect to clue in the general public about the relevant issues, it erodes whatever trust the industry has earned.
Prior to the 2005 Santa Anita Derby, the filly Sweet Catomine was taken off the grounds for treatment under an assumed name while being misrepresented as healthy to the betting public. The horse's connections circulated stories about Sweet Catomine jogging over the track on a morning she was not even on the grounds.
After Sweet Catomine finished fifth as the even-money favorite, and her cover stories were exposed as lies, the CHRB filed charges against the horse's owner, Marty Wygod, for conduct detrimental to horse racing.
That the case against Wygod was subsequently dismissed by California stewards suggested good lawyering and limited backbone. It would not be the last time justice might have been better served by an independent judge.

Going to the mattresses with manipulator Mendoza

Texto completo: Wow -- calling the lying swine in state Comptroller Susana Mendoza's office lying swine really got their back up.

Who knew?

They should take it as a badge of honor when they issue a misleading press release touting good news from a devastatingly negative 397-page financial report that is, for the most part, swallowed whole by a statewide audience. But instead of congratulating itself for a dirty job well done, the empire is striking back.

Readers can examine the full response to my Tuesday column in today's Letters to the Editor section.

Suffice it to say, this yapping cur won't be getting any Christmas cards from Mendoza or her minions. My sin: "getting his facts wrong and misleading" readers.

Mendoza's gripe concerns the recently released Illinois Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, which includes the tawdry details about the state's state of effective bankruptcy.

The comptroller's office put a positive spin on its press release about the report, announcing that "Illinois Cuts Its Deficit In Half In Fiscal 2018."

That's a selective reference to the state's "general fund," one of its multiple funds, not its overall financial "net position" picture.

Mendoza said the state managed the feat of cutting its general fund debt of $14.6 billion in the 2017 fiscal year to $7.7 billion in the 2018 fiscal year. It did so by issuing a new round of bonds, counting the bond proceeds as income and using the money raised to pay off part of the state's general fund debt.

In other words, it traded higher-interest debt for lower-interest bond debt. That's a sensible arbitrage play, but all it did was remove taxpayer debt from the general fund column and add it to its bonded indebtedness column.

What the comptroller's press release -- conveniently, just by happenstance, accidentally on purpose -- overlooked is that the state's overall net worth -- its "net position" -- declined by $47 billion. In fiscal 2016, Illinois' net position was a negative $126.7 billion. In fiscal 2017, it declined to a negative $184 billion.

The numbers are right there on P. 358 of the CAFR report under the heading, "Total Government Activities Net Position."

That figure was cited -- and quoted in The News-Gazette -- by a financial analyst at Wirepoints, a source the comptroller characterized as a "fringe website" unworthy of notice.

The comptroller's office may prefer to pretend Wirepoints has zero credibility. But its analyses of the state's financial problems have been cited by many general and specialty publications, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Barrons, Washington Post and The Bond Buyer.

Further, while the comptroller's office dismissed Wirepoints, it ignored an article from The Bond Buyer that echoed Wirepoints' concerns and also was quoted in the N-G piece.

The comptroller's office defended itself from suggestions that its rosy release had a political spin -- nothing to see here, move along.

It said it "highlighted a few of the more interesting numbers, good and bad, and invited everyone to explore all the numbers in the CAFR."

Yes, everyone, let's get out a copy of that 397-page CAFR -- filled with page after page of columns of numbers -- and go over it with a fine-toothed comb. But how realistic is the underlying assumption in the comptroller's "explore-all-the-numbers" invitation that non-experts can understand reports prepared for experts?

Not very, but it's not all incomprehensible. Under the heading "Financial Analysis of the State" (P. 180), it reads, "The state's combined net position decreased $47.426 billion or 34.7 percent during the current fiscal year."

Of that overall $47 billion decline in the state's net position, roughly $41 billion comes from including previously ignored costs for retired employees' health care.

So maybe the Wirepoints analysis, denounced by the comptroller for its "misinformation," and The Bond Buyer article, ignored by the comptroller, were more worthy of public consumption than Mendoza suggests.

Sheila A. Weinberg, the founder and chief executive officer of Truth in Accounting -- www.truthinaccounting.org -- attributes the conflicting perspectives to "confusion and misunderstanding" caused by "the way state and local government accounting is done."

"Under these rules governments maintain two sets of books that produce two vastly different pictures of the government's finances. In Illinois' latest Comprehensive Annual Financial Report one picture is that the general fund made $6.85 billion and cut its deficit in half. While another picture indicated the state lost $6.2 billion," she said, citing the "two sets of books" the state uses.

One -- the general fund -- is "cash-based accounting," and the other is "full accrual accounting," which Weinberg said is "similar to how businesses calculate their numbers."

The comptroller, of course, prefers the "don't worry, be happy" spin in her press release. But, overall, Illinois' negative net worth -- ranked 49 of the 50 states -- isn't anything to be happy about.

Baffert, CHRB respond to NY Times story on Justify failing drug test before Triple Crown run

Texto completo: This week the New York Times reported that 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify failed a post-race drug test after the Santa Anita Derby that could have kept the colt out of the Kentucky Derby.
Horse racing needs another controversy like Dodgers fans need a third World Series disappointment, yet here we are again. Less than two weeks removed from a historic Del Mar meet in terms of safety that helped restore some sanity in California, the sport is left with yet another black eye.
Why?
Because factions like the California Horse Racing Board, the Stronach Group and others can’t seem to grasp the concept that transparency is the only way to go. Deals and decisions made behind closed doors, whether right or wrong, oftentimes blow up in the decision makers’ faces. This is one of those instances.
Here’s what we know about the Justify saga:
— The New York Times reported Justify tested positive for a drug called scopolamine one day after winning the Santa Anita Derby on April 6. The story alleges the CHRB did not inform trainer Bob Baffert of the positive test until nine days before the Kentucky Derby. A second test on May 1, at the request of Baffert, also came up positive.
— Joe Drape, who wrote the Times article, said the CHRB let the matter drag on until after Justify swept the Triple Crown. He reported the CHRB did not file a public complaint per usual protocol and instead made a series of decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case in its entirety after the Belmont Stakes on June 8. Later, the CHRB amended its rules on scopolamine positives.
— On Thursday, Churchill Downs tweeted that “until media reports surfaced Wednesday night, neither Churchill Downs nor the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission had knowledge of any potential tests that may have emanated from California in advance of the 2018 Kentucky Derby.”
— Churchill Downs maintained “we do know that all pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby participants came back clean, including Justify.” The race track also noted, “in advance of our race each year, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission conducts pre-race out-of-competition testing for every Kentucky Derby starter and all starters’ results were clean.” It added that all post-race tests for “a myriad of banned substances” were clean.
— Baffert, in a statement Thursday, claimed he had no influence on any decisions made by the CHRB, saying, “I unequivocally reject any implication that scopolamine was ever intentionally administered to Justify, or any of my horses. Test results indicating trace amounts of the drug were undoubtedly the result of environmental contamination caused by the presence of jimson weed in feed, a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California.” Baffert added: “Justify is one of the finest horses I’ve had the privilege of training and by any standard is one of the greatest of all time. I am proud to stand by his record, and my own.”
— Baffert’s lawyer, Kentucky-based Craig Robertson III, called Drape’s reporting “defamatory.” He also said in a letter addressed to Drape that his article was “long on sensationalism” and “short on facts.” Robertson said: “No trainer would ever intentionally administer scopolamine to a horse. It has a depressant effect and would do anything but enhance the performance of a horse.”
— Chuck Winner, whose five-year reign as chairman of the CHRB expired recently, released this comment Thursday afternoon: “It is most unfortunate that the correct decision by the CHRB to not pursue action due to what was clearly a case of environmental contamination has been badly mischaracterized. All possible tests and procedures and investigations were followed by the CHRB Equine Medical Director and senior staff, which led to the overwhelming evidence that Justify, along with six other horses in four different barns at Santa Anita, ingested scopolamine from jimson weed which was present in the hay that had been delivered to the barns. Furthermore, under ARCI guidelines, scopolamine is a class 4c substance, which would not trigger disqualification or redistribution of a purse.”
Winner went on to say: “The whole premise of the story is false on its face … California law mandates that test results must remain confidential unless and until a complaint is filed, and a complaint can only be filed at the end of an investigative process. It would have been a complete miscarriage of justice for the CHRB to have taken action against Justify or Baffert.”
The CHRB dropped the ball here. It should have informed both Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission about Justify’s positive test. Seeing as though it normally takes 60-90 days for a drug positive to be resolved, it’s highly questionable whether Justify would have been denied a spot in the Kentucky Derby. We’ll never know.
There are so many questions left unanswered in this mess:
— What is the effect of scopolamine on a horse?
Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB, echoed Robertson’s thoughts and scoffed at the suggestion in an interview with the Thoroughbred Daily News that the drug helped Justify during his Triple Crown run.
“Jimson weed is a weed we see in California not infrequently,” he said. “This is not a case of someone drugging a horse. This is a case of a horse poisoning. The source of it is a poisonous plant.”
Arthur also defended his and CHRB executive director Rick Baedeker’s decision to put the case to rest.
“The Board, on my and the executive director’s recommendation, made the correct, appropriate and the gutsy decision to dismiss the case,” he told TDN.
But in Drape’s story, he quotes Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018, as saying “the drug can act as a bronchodilator to clear a horse’s airway and optimize a horse’s heart rate, making the horse more efficient.” Sams added that the 300 nanograms per milliliter was excessive, and he suggested the drug was intended to enhance performance. Said Sams: “I think it has to come from intentional intervention.”
So who’s right here?
Because of horse racing’s non-transparent nature, we’ll never know what Baffert’s intentions were. We’ll never know why the CHRB acted as it did. Would Justify have been as brilliant during his historic run without scopolamine? Because of that non-transparency, Justify’s Triple Crown will forever carry a huge asterisk.
So there you have it, what should stand as one of horse racing’s shining moments now has a huge black stain on it. Telling the truth from the beginning could have avoided this mess. But then, we’re talking about horse racing.
Wonder if any owner will ever name a horse “Transparency.”

Texto completo: Considering David Axelrod helped guide one of the most brilliant presidential campaigns in history, it’s a little jarring that he’s offering 2020 Democrats probably the worst advice of the season.
In an op-ed for the New York Times on Wednesday, Axelrod lays out a strategy for the party’s nominee that comes straight out of the failed 2016 playbook.
“Mr. Trump’s serial assaults on the decency and the decorum upon which civil society depends are enraging — and meant to be,” Axelrod wrote. “It is only natural to respond to his every provocation with righteous indignation. My advice to the Democratic nominee next year is: Donʼt play.”
Axelrod reasons that it doesn’t really matter all that much whom Democrats nominate or whether their candidate has an inspiring message for the general election, because “the person most capable of defeating Donald Trump is Donald Trump,” and “if Democrats are smart, they will let him do the job.”
How come Hillary Clinton hadn’t thought of that?
The idea that a corpse can beat President Trump in a race is a ridiculous, but it remains a lasting -ism of the Democratic Party. They quite nearly did run a corpse in the last presidential election, and she got thumped.
In his op-ed, Axelrod cautioned Democrats to avoid “wrestling” with Trump, because it’s his “preferred form of combat.”
Wrong. Politics is a fight by nature, and Trump just happens to be very good at embracing that fact and engaging. Presidential candidates are expected to have a clear, winsome direction for the country and the ability to demonstrate why electing that other guy would be a tragedy.
It's not simply a matter of hoping people see for themselves how awful the other guy is.
“When they go low, we go high,” may have been aspirational, but it was equally delusional. It’s easy to “go high” when you’ve convinced yourself that it’s not necessary to actively defeat your opponent, as opposed to hoping that they somehow defeat themselves.
Axelrod’s advice for 2020 Democrats is bad. So here’s my advice to 2020 Democrats: Take it!

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied news reports that he instructed his administration to rebuke weather forecasters for contradicting his claim that Hurricane Dorian was a threat to Alabama.
"No, I never did that. I never did that," he said in the Oval Office. "That's a whole hoax by the fake news media, when they talk about the hurricane and when they talk about Florida and when they talk about Alabama. That's just fake news. … It's a fake story."
Two congressional committees are investigating whether top administration officials acted improperly after Trump said Sept. 1 Dorian could impact Alabama – long after the state was no longer in the potential path.
Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, who chairs the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, sent a letter Wednesday to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross demanding information related to the department's involvement in the president's claim and the steps officials took to defend him.
Johnson seeks documents, records and correspondence related to the president's claim Sept. 1 and a statement Friday from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (which is under Commerce) defending the president.
"We are deeply disturbed by the politicization of NOAA's weather forecast activities for the purpose of supporting incorrect statements by the President," Johnson's letter to Ross says. "It is essential that these forecasts remain free of political influence and suppression."
The letter was co-signed by Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., who chairs the panel's subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation. Tuesday, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra l Grijalva, D-Ariz.,sent a similar request to Ross.
On Sept. 1, Trump tweeted out a warning that Alabama was one of four states "most likely to be hit (much) harder than anticipated" by Dorian even though forecasts showed the storm heading north along the Atlantic coast.
Twenty minutes after Trump's tweet, the Birmingham branch of the National Weather Service tweeted to clarify that Alabama was not in the pathway of Hurricane Dorian.
"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian," the NWS wrote.
News reports said acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney directed Ross last week to have NOAA publicly counter the forecasters by saying Alabama was at risk to bolster the president's claim. Ross threatened to fire officials at the National Weather Service over the issue, according to The New York Times.
Friday, NOAA issued a statement defending the president.
"Information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama," it reads. The National Weather Service tweet "spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time."
Former top officials with NOAA accused the agency of what they said was choosing politics over science.

'Timing Is Right' for Harris to Recapture Magic

Texto completo: The good news for Senator Kamala Harris of California is that all the political ingredients are there. Her campaign launch in Oakland remains the largest rally of any Democratic candidate this year, her Senate committee videos go viral and she ignited the most talked-about debate moment to this point, when she confronted the front-runner, Joseph R. Biden Jr., regarding his Senate record on school integration.
The downside: Even with those head-turning moments, she is currently polling closer to the bottom rung of Democratic candidates than she is to the top tier in national surveys.
Ms. Harris's summer dip places additional pressure on her performance at the third Democratic debate in Houston, as surrogates, donors and even some supporters are looking for her to recapture the magic that initially won them over.
Many of her campaign advisers contend there is no cause for panic at the moment, pointing to the calendar -- and the four-and-a-half months between Thursday and the Iowa caucuses. Others push back on the idea that the primary has become a three person race between Mr. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Jess Morales Rocketto, the political director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, said that, in her view, Ms. Harris represents what the party really wants to be and the debate is a crucial moment for the senator to make that clear.
"Voters and operatives, they want to make her their candidate," she said. "They haven't yet because she needs to show some more work to make that happen."
Representative Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat who has endorsed Ms. Harris, said she feels confident about her current position. Ms. Fudge expects the California senator to go on the attack in this debate because "the timing is right," she said.
"This debate matters in particular because people don't start paying attention until after Labor Day," Ms. Fudge said. "Now every day people are starting to pay attention, so this is an important one."
In the last week, both the promise and pitfalls of Ms. Harris's campaign were on display, a microcosm of a campaign that has been defined by both high points and inconsistency. On Monday, she issued a sweeping criminal justice plan, which won her plaudits from progressive activists who had been critical of her reform record in California. But the release was somewhat muddled, as Ms. Harris had to spend the weekend apologizing for a video from an event where she seemed to laugh with an audience member who referred to the president using a mental health slur.
For some, Ms. Harris's up-and-down summer is simply a byproduct of her own success, after an impressive debut and early fund-raising numbers created artificially high expectations she was never going to immediately meet. However, despite Ms. Harris being in the Senate since 2017, her advisers point out that she came into the race without a firm national presence and is the highest-polling Democrat from that position.
"People want to know what makes you tick," Ms. Fudge said, relaying what she has personally told Ms. Harris. "They want to know what your values are, where you come from. That's the huge issue."
Ian Sams, Ms. Harris's spokesman, said in a statement that Democrats should expect Ms. Harris to "take on Donald Trump directly" in the debate, and "make the connection between his hatred and division and our inability to get things done for the country."
In private discussions and in donor calls, Ms. Harris's team has acknowledged the need to better define her policy message and separate herself from her Democratic rivals. They also, particularly after her success in the first debate, have stressed to Ms. Harris that voters respond positively when she leans into her biography as a child of immigrants with a barrier-breaking career.
In an interview last week with The New York Times, Ms. Harris appeared unfazed by the fluctuations of the summer or the pressure to have another well-received debate performance.
In recent weeks, the California senator has tried to differentiate her policy message from Democratic rivals -- offering her own plans on health care, climate change and criminal justice reform. She has also noticeably eradicated go-to phrases like "we need to have that conversation" from her public vocabulary, after criticism she seemed too cautious.
"Maybe I've made it more clear, but I've been clear the whole time," Ms. Harris said of her policy vision. "I've always thought and talked about what wakes people up in the middle of the night."
Still, at times, Ms. Harris's attempts to occupy a pragmatic middle ground between progressive firebrands and old-school Democratic moderates can land in awkward ways. In late July, she said "I'm not trying to restructure society," but in recent weeks she has released a criminal justice plan that would overhaul prisons and police practices, and embraced the possible elimination of the Senate filibuster to pass the Green New Deal.
"I plan on restructuring things in a way that will address those things that wake people up in the middle of the night," Ms. Harris clarified last week. "That's the consistent through line from the beginning. And frankly, even before I ran, I've always thought about it around that kind of metaphor."
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren often target Wall Street corporations as the root cause of people's problems, and Mr. Biden has singled out President Trump as a unique existential threat. When asked what she views as the root cause of societal problems, Ms. Harris said leaders do not see and understand the tangible hardships of working families.
"It is not about some textbook stuff. It is not some intellectual stuff. It's not some ideological stuff," she said. "It literally is, what is that person experiencing?"
"So maybe it's my life experiences," Ms. Harris added. "But these aren't intellectual things for me. 'What keeps people up at night?' -- those have had a profound impact, a profound effect, on me."
It is this type of self-assuredness that supporters hope they will see from her on the debate stage. Some sounded almost giddy that Ms. Harris was not likely to be a primary focus of either the moderators or her opponents. Instead, they said, she would have a prime opportunity to forcefully remind the country that there is a reason people have been whispering about her running for president since she arrived in Washington.
Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of the advocacy group Indivisible, said she still believes Ms. Harris can win over progressive voters, but it would require her embracing the language of systemic reform -- which Ms. Harris has rejected in the past.
"We've been really pleased to see her coming forward on climate change and on criminal justice," Ms. Greenberg said. "But it does feel like she needs to talk about what is the overarching vision that connects those pieces, which are really about significant societal change and structural reform."
Aimee Allison, founder and president of She the People, the an organization for women of color that held a presidential forum this year that included Ms. Harris, said a generous amount of good will still exists for her candidacy. However, the campaign has -- to this point -- been defined by a series of "one step forward, two step back moments," she said.
"People want a sense of political courage," Ms. Allison said.
She offered Ms. Harris a succinct pre-debate message: "She better come correct."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- William Happer, the White House architect of a stalled plan to attack the established science of climate change, is leaving the Trump administration on Friday, according to three people familiar with his plans.
Dr. Happer, a physicist who gained notoriety by claiming that the greenhouse gases contributing to warming the planet are beneficial to humanity, and for likening attacks on fossil fuels to "the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler" in a 2014 interview, serves on the National Security Council as President Trump's deputy assistant for emerging technologies.
His signature effort at the White House was a plan to establish a panel to question the scientific consensus that climate change is overwhelmingly caused by humans and is a growing threat to national security. The effort was blocked by other senior White House and administration officials, including members of the military and intelligence communities.
Dr. Happer also tried to edit scientific facts about climate change in testimony to Congress from a State Department intelligence analyst. His suggestions, first reported by The New York Times, included objecting to the phrase "tipping point" to describe when the planet reaches a threshold of irreversible climate change.
"'Tipping points' is a propaganda slogan for the scientifically illiterate," Dr. Happer wrote in a margin comment captured by track changes in working documents. "They were a favorite of Al Gore's science adviser, James Hansen."

The White House and a spokesman for the National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment, and Dr. Happer did not respond to an email seeking comment on Wednesday. His departure was first reported by E&E News, an energy policy news site.
The three people familiar with Dr. Happer's plans noted the former Princeton University professor just turned 80 and had always intended to stay at the White House for one year.
"There's this big hole now," said Steven J. Milloy, a member of President Trump's transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency who runs the website junkscience.com, which is aimed at casting doubt on the established science of human-caused climate change.
"There's nobody in the White House to pick up where Will left off, except the president."
Environmental activists cheered Dr. Happer's departure but said they are still bracing for continued attacks on climate science from the White House.
"Someone who denies the existence of nuclear weapons or terrorism would never be given a senior position at the National Security Council, and that should have been true on climate change, which is recognized across parties as a security threat to the United States," said Francesco Femia, a co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan think tank. "So while this is good news, he never should have been there in the first place."
Rob Vessels, a campaign manager with the Sierra Club, an environmental group, said it was "an indictment of the Trump Administration's dangerous denial of the climate crisis that countless deniers like Happer continue to be welcomed with open arms."
Dr. Happer's exit is the latest White House shake-up in an administration that has seen near-constant turnover and comes on the heels of President Trump's ouster of John R. Bolton, his third national security adviser. Mr. Bolton was a supporter of Dr. Happer's positions on climate change in the White House, according to several people with knowledge of their relationship.

Can Marianne Williamson's Fans Astrally Project Her Into The Presidency

Texto completo: It began, like so many modern presidential campaign stories do, as a joke. Sarah Marilyn, a 28-year-old Brooklyn social media strategist, didn't bother to watch the first Democratic debates in June. She was only vaguely aware that they were happening until the memes began cascading onto her phone. She chased the best jokes, fell into a kind of Photoshop fugue state, and emerged as the co-founder of a Facebook page dedicated to the candidate with the most stimulating content: Marianne Williamson's Dank Meme Stash.
It took only a few hours for her ironic interest to bloom into something more. Was it just her, or was Marianne Williamson actually kind of making sense? Somebody tweeted that "Marianne Williamson just needs 2 or 3 hot Bushwick witch girls to run her social media and she will absolutely run away with this," and Marilyn decided that she would be one of them.
As Marilyn waded into the campaign, she met resistance from Williamson's old-school supporters, the kind of people who sincerely seek her spiritual self-help content. When Marilyn shared a meme featuring the candidate in a meditative pose that said "Re-Align America's Chakras Again," somebody called her a "hater." Others worried that mocking memes would undermine Williamson's claim to a serious run. Williamson herself seemed a little spooked. "I am not a cult leader," she clarified on Twitter. "Why do people make crystal jokes?" she pleaded to The New York Times. "I don't use crystals!"
But Marilyn wasn't concerned. She'd seen what happened with President Trump, and she believed that Williamson could cast a similar kind of spell.
In a modern campaign, unseriousness can be a virtue. We are living in a time when two meme-literate teenage boys are directing the campaign of an 89-year-old former senator. They are the political equivalent of children stacked in a trench coat, angling to buy a ticket to the presidential race. And they are riffing, really, on the example set by Trump himself: that joke candidacies can be laced with serious potential.
In Marilyn's Bushwick apartment in August, we spoke about the proximity she sees between Williamson and Trump. "Both of them are talking to people who don't take politics very seriously," she said. These political cynics "think the whole system is corrupt," she added. "The only way they're going to engage is if it's not going to take serious energy from their souls."
THERE'S A PERSISTENT MEME format known as the expanding brain meme that depicts a human brain growing in size and strength until it is so intellectually powerful that mind lasers blast from its skull. Somebody crafted a version of it that perfectly articulates Marilyn's position: The most intellectually evolved stance in the 2020 election -- the laser-brain one -- is to support Williamson both ironically and unironically. Perhaps the giddy feeling of memeing could translate into the grass-roots energy necessary to lift a guru to the White House. I mean, has anything Joe Biden has ever said supplied the natural high produced by grafting Williamson's face into a scene of the Na'vi people of "Avatar?" All Marilyn knew is that she had never been so excited about politics.
Within a month, she was juggling 20 meme pages and managing online efforts across the chat service Discord, the livestreaming platform Twitch, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Instagram, plus a candy-colored central hub, OrbGang.love. She helped leverage the crystal ball emoji to inject Williamson's ethereal vibe into the wonky discourse, calling Williamson her #OrbMom and the movement the #OrbGang (styled after the #YangGang, for fans of Andrew Yang). Posters on her pages often addressed their messages to either "ironic supporters" or "unironic supporters," but increasingly that was a distinction without a difference. "Thanks to this group," one supporter wrote on Marianne Williamson's Dank Meme Stash, "I would now for real vote for Marianne Williamson."
When the second debate came around, in July, Marilyn attended a watch party in Manhattan. I descended into a basement to find it stuffed with a diverse array of her fellow travelers. There were younger men in tank tops and older ones in suspenders. One woman clutched Nancy Pelosi's memoir and another wore a fez, which she was very much pulling off. A guy in a Dallas Cowboys hat and river sandals engaged me in a crossed-arm double handshake and said, "We've closed the energy circle."
We did not see much of Marianne Williamson that night. Long shot candidates with more traditional qualifications -- John Delaney, Tim Ryan -- crowded out the margins of the televised debate. But the real action was not happening on CNN. As Beto O'Rourke droned on about his "administration" on TV, Marilyn stared into her phone, its glow revealing her beatific smile as she thumbed out tweets like "My spicy orb mom there is no other but you." A few incisive political points (Williamson's speech advocating reparations) and aesthetic quirks (she dropped a "yadda, yadda, yadda") would be enough to sustain the #OrbGang for weeks.
By the end of the evening, Williamson had become the most-searched-for candidate on Google in every state except Montana. When she walked off the stage, a reporter asked her to rate her performance and she replied, "I'll tell you later when I see the memes." Soon she would share one on her Instagram: her face Photoshopped into "Game of Thrones," with Williamson styled as Melisandre, a priestess who is secretly very old and works blood magic in the service of her god, the Lord of Light.
The next morning, Marilyn texted me a link to a Twitch stream where #OrbGang members crowdsourced fresh memes. The Williamson memers run a shadow campaign, discussing strategy, philosophy and psychology. The day after the debate, they were capitalizing on a report from The Hill newspaper that claimed they were organizing an "occult task force" of "chaos magicians, witches and energy workers."
It was the kind of straight-faced reporting of manifest absurdity that creates a richly ambivalent environment for memes to thrive. A supporter began assembling an "Orbgang Chaos Magician Starter Pack" on Photoshop featuring occult objects. "I'd recommend a classical painting of witches," someone advised over chat. "Or possibly the Goya painting of the seance with the goat devil."
IRONIC OR NOT, all the meme energy behind Williamson's campaign was not strong enough to propel her into the third Democratic debate. But Williamson's fans are undeterred. "We will be orbing/meme-ing Marianne into the debate coverage," Marilyn wrote in an email to supporters.
Or to put it in the language of Marianne memes: They will astrally project her onto that stage. Soon, Williamson had announced that she would hold her own kind of shadow debate: a "What I Would Have Said Had I Been There" livestream. Marilyn is stockpiling memes in anticipation.
Williamson may not be our next president, but this kind of half-parodic campaign -- in which disengaged voters proficient in memes plumb the psychic undercurrents of the American electorate to forge an ambivalent relationship with the candidate's official efforts -- may just be our future. After all, as Marilyn puts it: "Ironic votes are just votes."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova accused ex-CIA Director John Brennan of being the "father of all leaks" about a CIA informant close to the Kremlin.
Calling for an investigation into Brennan, diGenova said the vocal Trump critic is the source behind the "fraudulent" NBC News story about a possible Russian spy living openly in a suburb of Washington, D.C., and other reports.
"As part of the Russia hoax, they needed to create the image that somehow this information had gotten out from Putin about influencing the election. So John Brennan created the myth of this guy whose initials are O.S. And who lives in Virginia," diGenova said Tuesday evening on Fox News during a panel with host Laura Ingraham and attorney Alan Dershowitz.
"And who bought a house in his own name and lives openly and notoriously," he continued. "Now when the CIA brings back a real asset, do you know what they do? They hide him forever. They give him a fake name. He lives in Siberia but they don’t allow him to live in Fairfax, Virginia, under his name. This story was leaked by John Brennan who gave the name and the address of the agent to NBC news who sent one of the reporters there. Thank you, John Brennan. Great patriot. This is a fraudulent story perpetuated by Brennan, and he should be indicted for incompetence and fraud."

Following reports revealing the informant being extracted from Russia in 2017, NBC News published a story that said they sent a reporter to the house of a former senior Russian government official in Virginia, who might be the informant. Within minutes an SUV drove up with two men inside who identified themselves as friends of the Russian and asked the correspondent what he was doing there. Current and former officials said these men were probably government agents and the Russian will likely have to be relocated as a precaution.
DiGenova said he believes the same "CIA people" were the sources behind prior reporting about the spy, who provided critical information to Brennan and former President Barack Obama about Putin's role in ordering 2016 election interference.
Back in May, one day after President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr "full and complete authority to declassify information" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the New York Times reported this source is in jeopardy. But this week multiple news reported the informant was evacuated from Russia in 2017.
Another source of controversy this week has been how CNN's report strongly suggested the extraction was due to concerns about Trump's handling of classified information. Following strong denials by the White House and the CIA, the New York Times revealed that the informant was offered, and denied, a chance for extraction in 2016, before Trump took office, and that it was media scrutiny that prompted concerns about the individual's safety.
Dershowitz said there has to be a stop to these "weaponized leaks in a partisan war," which are putting the lives of U.S. informants at risk.
"This is such a joke that they send a reporter to the guy’s house," diGenova added. "Look. Failed Russian hoax. Your story doesn’t work anymore. What’s the next thing? Okay, let’s blame Trump for exposing a spy in Russia. Even worse falsehood, complicit CNN, NBC totally false story, thank you, John Brennan."

Historical context is no excuse for founders’ failure on slavery -BYLN-

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach — that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses — or at least mitigations — for the moral failures of the founders on matters of race.
The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later. The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country’s founders precisely because of the moral ideals the founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins urged his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain’s attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery…?"
America’s founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America’s story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle — the principle of human equality — introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation’s founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America’s moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Texto completo: When it comes to freedom of the press in the United States, I truly believe we are at a crisis point. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump gone after journalists and publications he doesn't like (at times even boycotting them). Journalists are being targeted and are part of his stump speeches on the campaign trail. He even encourages violence and aggression toward them.
Now the president and his allies are taking his war with the media a step further with a new tactic of digging up dirt on specific reporters. As described in a memo viewed and quoted by Axios, the group says it will circulate the damaging information to Trump-friendly media outlets and others as well.
The top "fake news" targets named in the tactical memo are CNN and MSNBC, "all broadcast networks," the New York Times, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, and their reporters and editors. Axios has also reported, based on unnamed participants, that pro-Trump groups are preparing to attack alleged bias by social media platforms as part of Trump's 2020 re-election strategy.
While these tactics are unconventional, it's more important to focus on the real issue at hand: Freedom of the press and how this will erode trust in the fourth estate. It is critical that the press be allowed to do its job, which means fact-checking and reporting. While today's news cycle has become hyper-partisan, it is still important for journalists to be held accountable – and for them to hold our government accountable. As Thomas Jefferson said, "Our liberty depends on the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost."
It's no secret that during the Obama administration there were frequent complaints about right-of-center media outlets for pandering to a specific viewpoint, and they were sent to the back of the line or criticized for what was deemed unfair coverage. But it is hypocritical for the Trump administration to do the same thing (and to a much greater and more dangerous extent). So far we have seen the Trump administration single out journalists and outlets for what he believes to be "fake news," and even try to revoke White House passes from two reporters. But all outlets deserve the right to report on the happenings at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, because, after all, it is the people's house.
This rhetoric against the media has also become dangerous. In October, there was a series of scary moments when suspicious packages containing faulty pipe bombs were found on or near the properties of many Trump targets, from Barack Obama and the Clintons to CNN's studios. I would hate to jump to conclusions as to why explosive devices were sent to these places, and a judge did not accept the defense argument that Trump's rhetoric contributed to these crimes. Yet it is important to note the language that has consistently come from the White House about journalists and the media as well as Democrats.
Has this become the new normal? If you are a public official or a member of the press, should you constantly be on edge and fear for your safety or even your life?
What's more, in the wake of the targeted attacks Trump has only ramped up the attacks on the media by calling the press "truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE" in an April tweet. It is important to remember that leadership comes from the top and America currently has a president who advocates for "body slamming" reporters, mocks and ridicules mainstream media networks and their anchors, calls the media the "enemy of the American people" refers to Democrats as "extremists" and an "angry, ruthless, unhinged mob," joked about punching protesters in the face, and casts significant blame and name calls Democratic leadership. Trump must stop his own fear-mongering rhetoric against the news media and call for an end to this type of rhetoric overall.
While White House officials are trying to punish various networks for what they deem unfair coverage, they are missing opportunities to correct the record that they feel misrepresents their agenda, and to reach a broader audience. The administration needs to accept that President Trump represents all Americans, not just the ones who voted for him. And with that should come the understanding that not all Americans watch the same news programs.
Throughout the eight years of the Obama administration, conservatives voiced their dissatisfaction with Obama's progressive policies; now it is crucial for conservatives to respect the right of those who disagree with the current president to voice their concerns. Free speech is a foundation of our society and vital to a healthy, vibrant democracy.
Trump consistently belittles reporters he disagrees with and will shut them out from asking questions, but it's important that they keep asking and don't stand down. The First Amendment isn't selective; it applies to everyone. Trump would be smart to recognize that the First Amendment he so ardently defended during the campaign also applies to his adversaries and those whose political opinions are different from his.
As the 2020 presidential campaign moves forward, journalists should not fear digging for the truth and should always strive for accuracy in their reporting. They are the guardians of a pillar of our democracy.

Texto completo: Today, I decided to try a recipe for "really the best gazpacho ever" shared a while ago by a reader.
My reason for trying it today was that I harvested a basket of ripe tomatoes with spots or cracks and had to do something with them, and quick.
So I cut bad parts off and plugged in my blender. I blended the tomatoes with red onion, cucumber, a Hungarian pepper from my garden, a bit of sherry vinegar, garlic, salt and a decent amount of olive oil. The recipe called for straining afterwards, but you know what? I had a big bowl of it straight from the blender, sans straining. Addictively good.
You could do either, leave as is or strain for an elegant presentation.
Now truth be told, I have a packed file of gazpacho recipes. This one, though, is my newest fave. A smooth Spanish style gazpacho, easy and so fast.
The bonus? It uses those late summer, less than perfect, dead ripe veggies.
Make this gazpacho! Let me know how you like it, OK?
Originally from Julia Moskin, New York Times. Here's my adaptation. As always, go to taste.
Ingredients
A good 2 pounds red or combo of ripe tomatoes, cored and chunked up — I used red, yellow, and grape
1 Cubanelle or sweet banana pepper or about half of a sweet bell, seeded and chunked. I used a sweet Hungarian banana pepper
1 cucumber, about 8" long, peeled and chunked
1/3 to 1/2 cup red or mild onion, chunked (careful, here, you can always add more but you can't take away...).
1 nice teaspoon garlic/1 large clove
1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
Salt — I used 11/2 teaspoons
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil or to taste, plus extra to drizzle
Instructions
Put everything but vinegar, salt and oil in blender and blend on high until very smooth. With motor running, add vinegar and salt.
Slowly pour in oil and blend until everything is emulsified and again, smooth. It will be the thickness of salad dressing. If a bit watery, add a little more oil until it's creamy the way you like it.
Now you can either strain it all through strainer or food mill, making sure you press hard on solids, or leave as is, or just strain some of it.
For a silky smooth soup, you should strain it all.
Chill about 6 hours or overnight.
To serve:
Adjust seasonings. If too thick, add a bit of ice water.
Serve with drizzle of oil.
Serve as appetizer or first course in shot or small glasses or as an entre in a bowl.
Try my garlic crostini alongside.
Substitute for sherry vinegar
Try red wine vinegar with maybe a tad of sugar, since sherry vinegar has a sweeter flavor profile.
Serve alongside the gazpacho.
Rub a clove of garlic on thick baguette slices. Drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with shredded Manchego, Parmesan, or leave plain.
Run under broiler.

Texto completo: Impossible as it may seem, our collective memory of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is starting to fade.
Even among those who stood in horror as the towers fell 18 years ago, the events have lost much of their visceral sting, the inevitable consequence of time and a world that doesn't let us linger on much for long.
And there is now a whole generation, some of them high school graduates now, that has been born since that terrible Tuesday. To them, 9/11 is history.
But for a relative few out there, the memories of 9/11 can never fade - circumstances just won't allow it. Wednesday, the anniversary, is their day.
There are, of course, the nearly 3,000 people who died directly in the attacks, as well as their loved ones, for whom the Sept. 11 anniversary is not only a day of national mourning but also a day of personal - and very public - tragedy.
Wives and husbands, sons and daughters, mothers, fathers and friends were lost so suddenly. The stories that came out later - that are still coming out today - of final phone calls and messages, and of tremendous acts of humanity and selfless courage aboard the airplanes and in the burning buildings, should be told and remembered.
And they are, by those who can't forget, in many places, including the plaza at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, where every day people leave trinkets and reminders as a way to mark the lives of loved ones lost in such an incomprehensible way.
As The New York Times reported, one message said simply: "Hay gente aun que te aman" - "There are still people who love you."
Today is for the first responders, too, who rushed to the scene, and everyone who worked for weeks in the rubble, only to get sick from exposure to harmful chemicals at the site.
Hundreds have died since of cancer and cardiovascular illness. Thousands more are expected to develop diseases as a result of their exposure at ground zero; experts predict that the death toll as a result of the aftermath will one day exceed that of the attacks themselves.
After Republicans dragged their feet for years, Congress this year finally passed a permanent reauthorization of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, which will provide billions of dollars for these heroes and their families through 2090. They never should have been made to worry that they'd be left hanging; now they won't have to.
And there are, of course, the thousands of members of the U.S. military who have served in the wars that followed the attacks. About 14,000 American soldiers remain in Afghanistan; 16 have been killed this year.
The seemingly intractable situation in Afghanistan shows how 9/11 echoes today, even if some of the soldiers there are too young to remember it.
The echoes can be seen in the continued influence of radical Islam, and of Islamophobia. They can be seen in our debates over troop deployments, defense spending and civil liberties. Today's students need to know the history of 9/11 to understand much of what is going on in the world now.
But today, the anniversary of the attacks, is about the people for whom Sept. 11, 2001, is far less academic, political or abstract.
For them, the anniversary is about personal loss, and on this day, they are in our thoughts.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Seventy. One hundred and eight. Twenty. One hundred and thirty-two. These were the weekly death tolls for security forces and civilians in Afghanistan in August. Compared to preceding months, it was relatively peaceful.
For the past year, The New York Times's Kabul bureau and The Times Magazine's At War channel have published weekly reports from the war in Afghanistan, documenting all significant security incidents from the previous seven days. The project began in September 2018 as a way to create more transparency around civilian and security-force casualties, since this information was being routinely suppressed by the Afghan and American governments.
Fahim Abed and Fatima Faizi, two Afghan journalists who write the reports, reflect on what they've learned from a year of tracking these deaths and injuries.
Fahim: Tracking casualties among Afghan forces and civilians is incredibly difficult. Right now, The Times is the only organization that tracks both (the United Nations monitors civilian casualties). For me, it was an important issue because I thought there should be a record of those dying in this war -- something we haven't had in the past. Only in November 2018 did the Afghan government acknowledge that more than 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers had been killed since 2015.
Every week, our team of five reporters and stringers in Afghanistan collects tips and stories from social and local media of security incidents. To verify them, we first call the provincial police or provincial governor's office for details. If we aren't getting consistent information, we also reach out to hospitals, provincial councils and so on. The casualty reports also include claims of Taliban casualties, but it's impossible for us to independently verify those claims. Taliban officials do not give out their own death tolls, or do not do so credibly, while on the government side, many officials give out inflated numbers.
Fatima: Sometimes it is a lot of work to verify a single incident. When the Taliban spokesman claims that there was an attack, I call my colleagues in the provinces and ask them to check. They go to their sources. Sometimes it takes 10 calls to get one confirmation.
Fahim: The province with the greatest number of casualties we've verified is Kunduz, in the north, where there were more than 405 deaths over the past year, followed by Badghis, in the northwest, and Farah, in the west along the border with Iran. Kunduz has been a hot spot for years, but before 2016 the other two provinces did not see a lot of Taliban activity. With the Taliban and the Americans in peace negotiations for much of the past year, it felt like the Taliban was trying to demonstrate its reach by targeting regions historically controlled by the Afghan government.
Fatima: Another thing we noticed, particularly in the last six months, was that 87 percent of the combat deaths among security forces that we tracked happened during Taliban assaults on military and police bases, outposts, checkpoints or command centers. The number of deaths during Afghan security offensives was pretty small.
Fahim: In several cases, after an attack, the government sent the wrong bodies to the families. At least once they sent a body to a family whose son hadn't even been killed; instead he was in Taliban custody.
Fatima: Reporting on Afghanistan, especially filing this report every week, can sometimes take a toll on me. One week in July, the death count was nearly 200, which was higher than average. A few minutes after I finished compiling our dispatch, our regional reporters called to say that there were more incidents to include. I spent two hours adding casualties that my colleagues had verified last-minute. My head felt so heavy, but I couldn't sleep. The numbers were just too large for me to process. At the end it was 322 people: 264 security force members and 58 civilians. Three hundred and twenty-two isn't just a number; it's 322 families.
Fahim: Once I dreamed about an outpost that was under attack by the Taliban in Faryab Province. In my dream, soldiers were calling us to tell officials to send reinforcements. In another dream, I saw soldiers being slaughtered by the Taliban at an outpost. Twelve bodies were lined up in a row for the funeral.
Fatima: Two months ago, I met the defense minister and showed him one of our published casualty reports. He had never seen one before. It left him speechless. These reports seem to be the only recognition of loss the Afghan security forces receive.

Texto completo: Headnote HURRICANE DORIAN
Dozens of weary Bahamas residents hoping to seek refuge in the United States from the storm-ravaged islands were kicked off a ferry headed for Florida on Sunday night, after an announcement on board that anyone without a valid visa would "have problems" at the American port of entry.
Videos of the incident, which occurred after an apparent failure of communication between the company operating the ferry and U.S. authorities, spread rapidly on social media. Frustrated passengers were lamenting that their hopes of getting away from Hurricane Dorian's devastation had been suddenly dashed.
"At the last minute like this," said one passenger, Renard Oliver, who held onto a toddler as he spoke to a reporter with the Miami television station WSVN. "It's hurtful because I'm watching my daughters cry, but it is what it is."
U.S. authorities issued conflicting statements about the matter in a space of a few hours on Monday, adding to the confusion and frustration among hurricane survivors.
Initially, Customs and Border Protection officials said that they would have allowed the passengers without visas into the United States as long as they had valid passports, documentation of a clean criminal record and prior approval for entry by the U.S. Embassy in the Bahamas. Later, though, a spokeswoman for the agency said that only travelers arriving by air, not by sea, were eligible to enter without visas.
"You can imagine that any kind of natural disaster like this, where you have this huge disaster, a lot of resources going on, there's going to be some confusion," Mark Morgan, the agency's acting commissioner, told reporters during a briefing at the White House.
But he then appeared to contradict, yet again, the latest official statement from the agency's communications office, as well as the experience of passengers on the ferry: "We're not telling the cruise line you cannot allow anyone without documents," he said. "That's just not being done."
Oliver, the passenger interviewed on television; said it was indeed being done. He said that after he boarded the boat, crew members announced over the intercom that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials had called the boat and said that anyone without a visa had to disembark the ship before it left the Bahamas.
U.S. officials said their procedures for processing Bahamians into the United States had not changed. They said that other cruise lines and airlines that have carried hundreds of people from the Bahamas to safety in the United States since Hurricane Dorian had taken a step that the ferry operators had not: They had contacted the U.S. Embassy before departure to confirm that passengers without visas met the requirements for entry, which include a valid passport and a clean police record obtained within the last six months.
A spokeswoman said the agency had not denied the ferry passengers entry into the United States, but instead had advised that passengers without visas disembark and coordinate with the U.S. Embassy, because without such preclearance, it would have taken hours to process them after arrival in Florida.
"CBP continues to process the arrivals of passengers evacuating from the Bahamas according to established policy and procedures - as demonstrated by the nearly 1,500 Hurricane Dorian survivors who arrived at the Port of Palm Beach, Fla., aboard a cruise ship on Saturday and were processed without incident," an agency spokeswoman said in a statement.
The statement continued, "CBP relies on the transportation companies in both the air and sea environments to be engaged in ensuring the safety and well-being of any individuals that have been devastated by this tragedy, and that requires transparent communication and planning for adequate resources to receive any arrivals."
The ferry was operated by the company Balearia, which conducts frequent sailings between Fort Lauderdale, Bimini and Grand Bahama - all popular tourist destinations. Representatives of the company could not be reached for comment, and it was not clear whether or why Sunday's boarding may have been handled differently from past boardings.
Peter Vazquez, a yacht broker in Fort Lauderdale who has been delivering aid to the Bahamas daily since the storm, said he had been bringing survivors back to South Florida and that they had encountered no problems. The people were not required to have a visa, but they did have to check in and be processed by Customs officials when they landed, he said.
In a statement, Sen. Rick Scott of Florida urged officials from CBP and the Bahamian government to clarify the rules on visas, to waive some visa requirements for those Bahamians who have family in the United States, and to set up a temporary site at U.S. ports of entry to help speed Bahamas residents through immigration clearance.
"As hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport," he said. - (The New York Times)

Texto completo: It’s sometimes lost amid Donald Trump’s endless affronts to the Republic, but the undermining of U.S. intelligence capabilities is one of the overarching stories of his administration.
So CNN’s scoop Monday about the exfiltration of a top U.S. intelligence asset in Russia is, like so much in the Trump era, both staggering and not at all surprising. According to CNN, in a secret mission in 2017, America “extracted from Russia one of its highest-level covert sources inside the Russian government,” partly because of worries that Trump’s cavalier handling of intelligence information could expose the person. On Monday evening, The New York Times added to the story, reporting that the source was a Russian official whose job provided “access to the highest level of the Kremlin.”
“The secret removal of the high-level Russian asset has left the U.S. without one of its key sources on the inner workings of the Kremlin,” reported CNN’s Jim Sciutto. The CIA gave CNN a carefully worded denial, and The Times cited former intelligence officials who said there’s “no public evidence that Mr. Trump directly endangered the source.” It’s hard to know exactly how to parse the word “directly,” or how much to credit the insistence, by some current administration officials who spoke to The Times, that news media scrutiny alone put the source at risk.
Even the possibility that Trump jeopardized America’s most important intelligence asset in Russia should be a very big deal, though I’m not sure it will be. The pundit class has mostly grown bored of the story behind Trump’s corrupt relationship with Russia. And too many in power, including almost all of the Republican Party, have grown used to the president deploying national security secrets in the same way he once traded tabloid gossip. He discloses U.S. intelligence to deflect attention from unflattering stories, suck up to people he wants to impress, or simply on a whim. He treats it, as he treats everything else in American government, as a private tool of self-gratification.
Trump, you’ll remember, was in office for only a few months before he revealed to Russia classified intelligence about ISIS that originated in Israel, potentially endangering a source who was, as The Wall Street Journal reported, “the most valuable source of information on external plotting by Islamic State.” This led a senior German politician to describe the president as a “security risk for the entire Western world.”
Not long after, Trump bragged to Philippine strongman Rodrigo Duterte about the presence of U.S. nuclear submarines off North Korea. (“We never talk about subs!” stunned Pentagon officials told BuzzFeed News.) Then, that September, after a subway bombing in London, Trump tweeted out that the perpetrators “were in the sights of Scotland Yard,” information that had not been publicly released. This prompted a rebuke from the British prime minister.
Less than two weeks ago, Trump tweeted what was likely a classified photo of the aftermath of an explosion at an Iranian space center. From the image, journalists and internet sleuths were able to deduce important information about the type and location of the satellite that produced it. “This is the first time in three and a half decades that an image has become public that reveals the sophistication of U.S. spy satellites in orbit,” reported Wired.
And these are just his own disclosures. The president personally overruled intelligence officials to demand that his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be given a top-secret security clearance. Kushner, in turn, may have passed U.S. intelligence to Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s homicidal crown prince; according to The Intercept, the prince boasted to confidants that he’d discussed Saudis disloyal to the regime with Kushner. Shortly after these alleged conversations, the crown prince initiated a purge.
So while the degree to which Trump’s logorrhea put the Russian asset in peril is not yet clear, what is clear is that Trump has gravely damaged America’s ability to collect crucial information, and not just about Russia.
Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told me that because of the president’s attacks on the intelligence community, “inexplicable fondness” for despots like Vladimir Putin, “and general lack of confidence in his discretion and judgment, I think it means that sources are more reluctant to share information with us.”
That includes not just individuals, but allied foreign intelligence services. These services, as Prof. Daniel Byman of Georgetown has written, have local resources that are hard to duplicate, and act as a “force multiplier for the United States.” “Countries have their own reasons for knowing what’s going on within their country or within their neighborhood,” he told me. It matters if they’re reluctant to share information with their American counterparts for fear that the president could reveal their sources and methods.
“Our allies understand that they can’t not share with us. They still have a great interest in receiving intelligence from us,” said Schiff. But, he said, every country makes fine-grained judgments about when to pass on the most sensitive of information. “These persistent problems with the president — his erratic nature, his questioning of his own intelligence agencies in favor of explanations given by Vladimir Putin — cause them great concern.”
One would like to think that America’s intelligence-sharing relationships can be repaired if Trump is voted out in 2020. But it’s not just the president that foreign spies can’t trust. The United States has shown the world that it is capable of putting someone like Trump in office, and that can’t be undone. He’s left the whole country compromised.

Texto completo: Tom Steyer, the billionaire and former hedge fund investor turned impeachment activist, became the 11th Democratic presidential candidate to qualify for the October debates on Sunday after a new poll showed him with 2 percent support in Nevada.
To make the cut, candidates must procure donations from 130,000 people and earn 2 percent support in four qualifying polls. Steyer fell one poll short of qualifying for the third Democratic debate in Houston this week. But the Democratic National Committee's rules allow polls to carry over and count toward qualification for the fourth set of debates.
With three qualifying polls already under his belt and the fourth published Sunday, Steyer has now secured a spot in the debates next month, scheduled for Oct. 15 and possibly Oct. 16, in a location to be announced in Ohio.
Only 10 candidates earned enough support to appear in this week's debate, and they will all appear on a single stage Thursday night. But with 11 candidates now qualified for the October event, the DNC may split that debate across two nights, as it did for the first two sets of debates in June and July. The committee has not yet indicated whether it will do so.

Pompeo continues ducking questions about Senate race
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo continued to deflect questions Sunday about his political future, declining to swear off a run for the Senate from his home state of Kansas next year.
Pompeo, who represented the southern portion of central Kansas for six years in the House before joining President Trump's Cabinet, has been Senate Republican leaders' top choice to replace Pat Roberts, a retiring Republican senator. They believe he could clear the GOP field and easily win the general election.
Pompeo, who served as Trump's CIA director before getting confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018, reiterated Sunday that he is focused on being America's top diplomat. But he appeared to leave open the possibility that he would run if the president wanted him to.
"I've said this repeatedly, as long as President Trump wants me to be a secretary of state, I will do what I've been doing for the last, goodness, almost year and a half now, focus on trying to deliver security for the American people. It's my mission every day," Pompeo said on ABC's "This Week."
Washington Post
Trump to visit Baltimore on Thursday to meet with GOP
Just weeks after lambasting Baltimore as a "disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess," President Trump will visit the Maryland city to huddle with congressional Republicans, a gathering that could draw local protests and reignite an ugly feud between the White House and the black-majority locality.
The White House confirmed Sunday that Trump would address House Republicans at their biennial retreat this Thursday. Republican lawmakers and aides — who chose the city for their three-day gathering before Trump decried it as "the Worst in the USA" — weren't sure the president would want to attend.
Trump's attendance could elate GOP lawmakers still licking their wounds from last fall's midterm shellacking by the Democrats, who took the House majority. But it could also spark protests from residents and local leaders who are still simmering over Trump's attacks on their city and don't want him there.
Trump's offensive on Baltimore started in late July, when he took to Twitter to accuse Representative Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, the House Oversight Committee chairman, of being a "brutal bully."
Cummings' panel has unearthed deficiencies in the administration, including shortfalls in the security-clearance process at the White House and concerns about Trump's decision to give his son-in-law Jared Kushner access to the nation's top secrets.
Washington Post
Air Force Alaska crew did not favor Trump Scottish hotel
Military officials are disputing a report that claims a joint Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard unit on a routine mission to Kuwait went miles out of their way to spend the night at a resort in Scotland owned by President Trump.
Politico first reported that the military transport that took off from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage in March spent the night at the Turnberry resort, about 50 miles outside Glasgow.
The disclosure comes as Trump last week denied he had any role in Vice President Mike Pence's booking a room at a Trump resort in Ireland or Attorney General William Barr's booking a holiday party at a Trump property in Washington, D.C., actions that Democrats and critics claim enrich the president at taxpayers' expense.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has opened an investigation into the matter.
Military flights making stopovers in Scotland are not unusual, and there were no rooms closer to the airport, an Air Force spokesman said Saturday in an e-mailed statement to the Associated Press.
"As our air crews serve on these international airlift missions, they follow strict guidelines on contracting for hotel accommodations and all expenditures of taxpayer dollars," Brigadier General Edward Thomas wrote.

Texto completo: The Kelleys were considering moving out of state before tragedy hit Thousand Oaks. What kept them here was the support they saw after the Borderline Bar & Grill mass shooting and the Woolsey fire.
“The support, immediate, massive and ongoing support,” said Mike Kelley on Monday. “This is home.”
“Home” is getting a “Healing Garden” at Conejo Creek North Park in Thousand Oaks to honor 12 innocent lives lost.
The Garden began its march toward completion Monday as crews began construction on the Thousand Oaks memorial, with a goal of finishing it by Nov. 7, the one-year anniversary of the Borderline mass shooting.
A skip loader moved dirt just south of an existing pond, home to turtles and koi. And soon, the sounds of loaders and crews will give way to a place of reflection.
The Healing Garden will be built at Conejo Creek North Park, the city’s most popular park.
It will honor:
* RON HELUS : The Ventura County Sheriff sergeant was shot running into the Borderline Bar to help.
* CODY COFFMAN : The 22-year-old had been meeting with recruiters and planned to enlist in the Army.
* JUSTIN MEEK: He worked as a promoter at Borderline Bar. The 23-year-old was a former student at Cal Lutheran.
* NOEL SPARKS: She was a Moorpark College student who liked horseback riding.
* ALAINA HOUSLEY: The 18-year-old was a Pepperdine University freshman who aimed to study law.
* TELEMACHUS ORFANOS: He had the misfortune of being at the Las Vegas mass shooting and the one in Thousand Oaks.
* SEAN ADLER: He was a security guard at the bar, but he has just opened his dream business: a coffeehouse.
* DANIEL MANRIQUE: He was an ex-Marine sergeant who dedicated his life to helping emotionally scarred veterans get back on their feet.
* BLAKE DINGMAN: This 21-year-old Newbury Park resident played high school baseball at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.
* JAKE DUNHAM: He always answers his phone, his father said, but it just keeps ringing.
* KRISTINA MORISETTE : She graduated from Simi Valley High School and reportedly worked as a cashier at the bar.
* MARKY MEZA JR .: He worked as a busboy and food runner at the bar and would have turned 21 in less than two weeks.

A group comprised of city and park officials, Ventura County sheriff’s officials and Cal Lutheran staff recommended building the memorial at the park by the one-year anniversary of the shooting.
Thousand Oaks Mayor Rob McCoy said officials were unwilling to let the building of a memorial languish for years, as it has for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
“We wanted to have that in place (in Thousand Oaks) because we’ll never forget that day,” McCoy told the Daily News in June, when the garden’s design was unveiled. “While it’s a place for the families to come, it’s a place for the entire city to come. Every resident, over 160,000 residents were affected.”
And so, officials are on a fast track to having it completed by that November anniversary date.
When it’s done, the “Borderline 12” will be represented by a fountain feature with 12 vertical jets in the center of a pond, according to the city’s plan.
The scene will symbolize the broader community. There will be a contemplation area, where a shoreline will include seating and landscaping. A large Oak will be planted bordering the garden area. A boulder will introduce visitors to the Healing Garden at its entryway.
There will be 12 large natural stone-slab benches along the plaza — granite to illustrate the strength of the community. A unique color will designate 248 pavers in a scene that will represent the number of survivors from that night. And at the site’s north end, the existing Lakeside Pavilion will offer space for community events and other gatherings.
On June 25, the city of Thousand Oaks approved a grant agreement with Conejo Recreation and Park District for $250,000 to provide funding for the construction.
Since November, Borderline has itself become a place of reflection.
Kelley touched one of twelve crosses at the makeshift memorial outside the closed club. It was there for Jake Dunham, one of the 12 victims and Kelley’s Newbury Park neighbor. Kelley and his wife watched Dunham grow up.
“He was a force,” Kelley said of the young man who rode motorcycles and worked on his truck with friends in the family garage.
“Watching his mother light his lantern (one of 12) and set it free was the single most emotional event I’ve ever seen in my life,” Kelley said.
The question is where will all the photos, bibles, cowboy boots, rocks, hearts and the ceramic “Love” and “Peace” sculpture end up after the formal memorial is built.
Since the Borderline massacre, 2019 has continued to be a year in which gun violence in the United States is taking a deadly toll.
According to Mass Shooting Tracker, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are shot (but not necessarily killed), there have been 352 such incidents in the United States this year.
And of those, according to the New York Times, which compiled MST’s and other data for a report, there were 38 shootings by the end of August in which three or more people were killed (the Department of Justice defines a mass killing as an episode in which three or more are killed). That number — 38 — includes the shooting in El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 3, in which 22 were killed.

NOAA's acting chief scientist reportedly to investigate effort to bolster Trump

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The acting chief scientist at NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is conducting an investigation after a week that ended with the scientific agency issuing a statement that sought to bolster President Donald Trump's erroneous claim that a recent hurricane posed a threat to the state of Alabama.
The development was reported Monday by both the Washington Post and the New York Times.
The Commerce Department, which oversees NOAA, also denied reporting from the New York Times Monday that Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire NOAA's political appointees over a tweet from the Birmingham, Ala. , station of the National Weather Service that contradicted Trump's initial tweet on Sunday, Sept. 1.
As Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas and threatened parts of the United States, Trump held firm on his Sept. 1 claim that the storm would threaten Alabama, despite being contradicted by the National Weather Service on Sunday soon after his original tweet. Trump used an altered NOAA map of Hurricane Dorian’s path as a visual aid while speaking reporters in the Oval Office last week.
Then, an unsigned statement released by NOAA late Friday disavowed the Sept. 1 tweet by the Birmingham station of the National Weather Service that had sought to correct Trump's claim.
"From Wednesday, August 28, through Monday, September 2, the information provided by NOAA and the National Hurricane Center to President Trump and the wider public demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama," NOAA wrote in a statement Friday, that also pointed to a number of its advisories during that period.
"The Birmingham National Weather Service’s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time," NOAA also said in the statement.

“The NWS Forecaster(s) corrected any public misunderstanding in an expert and timely way, as they should,” NOAA’s Craig McLean wrote in an email to his agency colleagues Sunday, according to the Washington Post. “There followed, last Friday, an unsigned news release from 'NOAA’ that inappropriately and incorrectly contradicted the NWS forecaster. My understanding is that this intervention to contradict the forecaster was not based on science but on external factors including reputation and appearance, or simply put, political. ”
After pointing out how the episode raises questions about trust in the agency's information, possible danger to the public as a result and the agency's scientific integrity policy, he continued: “I have a responsibility to pursue these truths,” NOAA's acting chief scientist also wrote. “I will. ”
The New York Times also reported Monday that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top employees at NOAA after the NWS’s Birmingham station contradicted President Trump's claim about Hurricane Dorian's path and Alabama.
According to the Times, Ross confronted acting NOAA Administrator Neil Jacobs by phone, demanding the agency fix the contradiction of Trump. Jacobs refused the request and was told by Ross that top NOAA political appointees would be fired if difference with Trump's claim was not rectified.
A Commerce Department spokesperson has denied the Times report in a statement provided to CNN.
"The New York Times story is false," the spokesperson said. "Secretary Ross did not threaten to fire any NOAA staff over forecasting and public statements about Hurricane Dorian. "

Texto completo: Iranian energy official Behrouz Kamalvandi says "there's not much time left" to save the nuclear agreement Iran entered into four years ago with the United States and several other countries. That is encouraging, because this is an agreement that should not be saved.
From the beginning, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was a bad agreement for the United States and our allies in the region. That's because it only paused Iran’s nuclear project, instead of ending it, and did nothing to stop Iran’s aggression against its neighbors, or its support of terrorism, or its brutal repression of the Iranian people.
President Donald Trump saved the world from the worst of the JCPOA when he withdrew America from it last year and imposed broad new economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its leaders.
US sanctions have reduced Iran impact
As a result, Iran’s economy is in a tailspin — with the International Monetary Fund projecting it will shrink by 6% this year, down from 3. 8% growth in 2017. Inflation may reach 40% or higher in 2019. And the sanctions have cost Iran at least $10 billion in lost oil sales.
These economic contractions brought on by U. S. sanctions have also had a limiting effect on the Iranian regime’s hegemonic ambitions. Iran has halted a credit line to the murderous Assad regime in Syria. And reports quoting unnamed Hezbollah employees and State Department officials, published by The New York Times, The Washington Post and Fox News, note Hezbollah and Hamas receiving less financial support from their patrons in Tehran.
In sum, the Iranian regime has been put on the defensive more than ever before. However, the political dynamics of the Democratic presidential campaign risk giving the Iranians renewed hope that if they can make it through the pain of sanctions until January 2021, they can look forward to a Democratic president bringing America back into the JCPOA.
Most of the party's presidential candidates have said they would do that if elected. The position gets a big round of applause from the partisan audiences of a primary campaign, but it's inconsistent with America’s national security interests. Our goal should be to negotiate a better deal with Iran rather than rushing back into the JCPOA. A better deal would end Iran’s nuclear program and eliminate two other dangerous parts of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA.
First, the arms embargo on Iran under this resolution expires Oct. 18, 2020. This sunset provision was one of the worst features of the agreement, because countries will no longer have to take measures to prevent Iranian transfers of weaponry to its terror proxies around the world.
Nuke deal sunsets would unleash Iran
Given Iran’s 40-year history of violence — assassinating, bombing and droning its enemies — the expiration of the embargo is incendiary. The Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas and Iraqi Shiite militias will be the primary beneficiaries. In report after report to the Security Council, U. N. member states have documented Iranian arms found on the battlefields of the Middle East.
In the latest version, the U. N. Secretariat examined “partly disassembled surface-to-air missile, three sets of wings pertaining to a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle, and a new unmanned surface vessel laden with explosives,” which were discovered in Yemen and found to be of “Iranian manufacture. ”
As my organization, United Against Nuclear Iran, has documented, if the United States rejoins the JCPOA without insisting on any changes, Resolution 2231’s sunsets would act as a force multiplier for Iranian manpower, money and materiel in the Middle East, and beyond.
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo:Trump administration pressure is weakening Iran’s regime
Second, the Oct. 18, 2023, termination of Resolution 2231’s limitations on Iran’s ballistic missile program, the delivery vehicle for nuclear weapons, will be particularly harmful. In the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 — the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom (the five permanent members of the U. N. Security Council) plus Germany — Tehran was able to soften and sunset the previous U. N. restrictions on its ballistic missile program. Prior resolutions mandated that “Iran shall not undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. ” But under Resolution 2231, this strong language was replaced: Iran was merely “called upon not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons. ”
In fact, Iran has found loophole after loophole in this permissive language and has threatened to increase the range of its missiles beyond 2,000 kilometers, or 1, 240 miles. It will surely do so if the limitations expire by 2023.
Resist pressure to oppose Trump
In the Democratic debate this week, I hope the candidates will take a second look at this critically important foreign policy question. They should explain why, if elected president, they would rush the United States back into an agreement that gives Iran a legalized pathway to a nuclear weapon and the means to deliver it, and enables Iran to give even more arms to terrorists and military forces that are hostile to the United States and our allies in the region.
Bad deal, boxed-in president: A wobbly Donald Trump decided not to strike Iran. We should be glad.
A better strategy would be to pursue a new, more comprehensive agreement covering nuclear and nonnuclear issues. But that will only be possible if the United States doesn’t rejoin the JCPOA and the U. S. economic sanctions against Iran stay in force.
The Iranians watch developments in Washington very closely, and the flow of leading Democratic presidential candidates announcing they will quickly reenter the nuclear deal will only encourage Tehran not to negotiate a new agreement now. A few of the Democrats — notably Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey — have resisted this pressure, and said they would aim for an improved agreement rather than rejoin the existing JCPOA.
Whether you were for or against the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015 won’t matter on Inauguration Day in 2021. The Trump administration’s maximum pressure campaign is working. I hope Democrats will recognize that inconvenient truth, and use it to find a way to a new and better agreement instead of reviving the flawed, old one.
Joseph I. Lieberman, a former senator from Connecticut and the 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, is chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran.

Burning Questions About the Amazon Fires

Texto completo: Hurricane season is upon us, so the media hysteria surrounding fires in the Amazon has moved off the front page. The world is still coming to an end in a decade or so, according to some environmentalists. But now it's warming seas rather than jungle infernos that we need to obsess about.
This apocalyptic flavor-of-the-month routine is regrettable, and not only because so many untruths are never corrected. It also wastes an opportunity for learning. In this case, early evidence suggests it's worth exploring the link between private property rights and responsible conservation in the Amazon -- quite the opposite of what you might have gleaned from most press reports.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a polarizing figure, and many in the media don't like him. Fair enough. But Brazil is a democracy, and after some 13 years of Workers' Party socialism and corruption, last year Brazilians asked for a change. Bolsonaro derangement syndrome doesn't hold the president accountable. It only deepens the visceral Brazilian divide.
Mr. Bolsonaro has shown disdain for policies aimed at walling off the Amazon from humans. So perhaps it isn't surprising that much of the data deployed by journalists to tell the story of the fires have been cherry-picked to make him look like an environmental villain. "Satellite data shows Amazon rainforest burning at record rates," United Press International shouted on Aug. 21. But the story seems to have made selective use of data collected daily by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research.
As of Saturday the data show that there have been 69,565 fires in Brazil's "legal Amazon" -- which includes savanna -- so far this year, up 59% from the like period last year. But the number of fires during the like period in each year from 2002-07 was significantly higher. For 2010, the last year of left-wing President Lula da Silva's eight years in office, the comparable number is 109,940 fires, a jump of 261% from the preceding year. The media never blinked. In fact, on Dec. 1, 2010, despite what had occurred in fire season, the BBC reported "Brazil: Amazon deforestation falls to new low."
The institute counted 97,972 fires in all of Brazil this year -- not only the Amazon -- up 51% from the preceding year. That sounds dire, but in 2010 there were 158,258 fires during the like period, an increase of 195% from 2009.
Photos of charred trees hype the media spin. Yet an Aug. 24 New York Times report on "scientists studying satellite image data" found that "most of the fires are burning on agricultural land where the forest had already been cleared" and "were likely set by farmers preparing land for the planting season."
NASA's Earth Observatory website says fire in the Amazon "typically increases due to the arrival of the dry season. Many people use fire to maintain farmland and pastures or to clear land for other purposes." There also has been drought in the south of the continent, raising fire hazards there.
Yet it isn't clear that the Amazon is experiencing anything historic, according to NASA's Earth Observatory: "As of August 16, 2019, an analysis of NASA satellite data indicated that total fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average in comparison to the past 15 years. . . Though activity appears to be above average in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia, it has so far appeared below average in Mato Grosso and Para, according to estimates from the Global Fire Emissions Database, a research project that compiles and analyzes NASA data." The page was updated Aug. 22. In a separate post the site said the fire activity is the highest since 2010.
In August 2016 Reuters reported on a study by the nonprofit Climate Policy Initiative that linked the absence of land titles in the Amazon to conflict and environmental degradation. "Without clear titles proving land ownership, farmers have less incentive to make new investments, improve productivity or protect the environment, said the CPI, a San Francisco-based group with operations in Rio de Janeiro," Reuters wrote.
No one knows exactly how much of the actual forest destruction has been on land that isn't private property. But it may be a lot.
Brazil's Ministry of the Environment compiles fire data, largely from the states. The ministry told me last week that from these data it estimates that 51% of the fires occurred on property with no title and no owner. Another 14% occurred on land that has been "donated" to the landless peasant movement known by the initials MST, and 13% were in conservation areas or on indigenous lands. Only 22% of the fires occurred on registered property.
This suggests that much of the destruction took place where there was no economic incentive to protect the forest because there is no private ownership. For those who actually care about the Amazon and aren't simply trying to score points against Mr. Bolsonaro, this is a trail worth following.

Texto completo: Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hello, my name is Cade Metz. I cover artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other "emerging technologies" for The New York Times. Today I'm here to give you the lowdown on the week's tech news.
It was another black eye for the giants of the industry. On Wednesday, Google agreed to pay a record $ 170 million fine. Regulators said YouTube, the company's enormously popular video site, had illegally collected personal information from children without the consent of their parents and used it to make millions of dollars from targeted ads.
Natasha Singer and Kate Conger reported in The Times that Google would pay $ 136 million to the Federal Trade Commission and $ 34 million to New York after a joint investigation found that YouTube had violated the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, known as COPPA.
That $ 136 million is the largest civil penalty laid down by the F.T.C. in a children's privacy case -- the previous record was $ 5.7 million -- but critics said it was a pittance for a tech giant like Google.
The settlement is another indication that the Trump administration is willing to take action against Big Tech. In July, Facebook agreed to pay $ 5 billion to settle a privacy case with the trade commission. But on Vox, Peter Kafka wrote that both the Google and Facebook settlements showed that the government wasn't ready to regulate the internet, arguing that there was no guarantee the companies would obey the law in the future.
"In both cases, the government is relying on the five-person F.T.C. to rein in the most powerful forces on the internet by asking them to interpret and enforce laws that are, in internet terms, prehistoric," Mr. Kafka wrote.
The settlement requires YouTube to ask people who upload videos whether they are sharing content for children and to change its data-gathering and ad-targeting behavior accordingly. But Mr. Kafka -- and an F.T.C. commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who voted against the settlement -- believes the company should be required to proactively identify content that children will view.
"A cynical observer might wonder whether in the wake of this order YouTube will be even more inclined to turn a blind eye to inaccurate designations of child-directed content in order to maximize its profit," Ms. Slaughter wrote in her dissent.

British court allows live facial recognition
Don't misbehave in Britain anytime soon -- at least not in public. Adam Satariano reported that a British court had ruled that governments could use live facial recognition technology without violating human rights. In other words, the police are free to use cameras in public spaces to identify people in real time.
Facial recognition technology is improving rapidly, and many legal and ethical questions loom as police departments and other government organizations increase their use of it in countries across the globe, from Britain to the United States to China.
Brought by a resident of South Wales, where the police have deployed live facial recognition, the High Court case is one of the first of its kind. The South Wales police and crime commissioner hailed the court's decision. Ed Bridges, the man who brought the suit, vowed to appeal.
"This sinister technology undermines our privacy, and I will continue to fight against its unlawful use to ensure our rights are protected and we are free from disproportionate government surveillance," Mr. Bridges said.
In China, according to reporting by my colleague Paul Mozur, the government is using the technology to track ethnic minorities. Other issues abound. Public advocates -- and many experts in artificial intelligence -- are concerned that facial recognition technology can be biased against women and minorities.

Big Tech talks election security with F.B.I.
Election Day is still 14 months away. And Big Tech is already planning security. Bloomberg reported that Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft met with government officials in Silicon Valley on Wednesday with an eye to reducing online disinformation and foreign interference in the run-up to the next American presidential election.
Security officers from the companies gathered at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., with representatives of the F.B.I., the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security. They want to facilitate coordination between industry and government in ways that didn't happen during the 2016 election. That could involve building threat models and, ultimately, sharing information about the real threats.
Yes, it's early. But after the 2016 election, it's never early.
______
Some stories you shouldn't miss
■ The chief executive of a company called Basecamp said Google search ads were a "shakedown." This is not an original thought, but amid the talk of antitrust action, it sounded a little different from before.
■ In The Atlantic, Zachary Fryer-Biggs explored the future of warfare and "robots that can kill." Though the United States military says it has no plans to take humans out of the loop, automated technology is improving.
■ Casper Klynge is the world's first foreign ambassador to the technology industry. But Silicon Valley hasn't exactly embraced Mr. Klynge, a Danish diplomat, as Adam Satariano noted in a profile. Don't miss the moment when a Silicon Valley executive bad-mouths European tech policy before handing Mr. Klynge a goody bag.
■ India is planning to land a rover on the moon on Saturday. That would make it the fourth nation to get there, after Russia, China, and the United States.
■ Hackers backed by the Chinese government have been burrowing into telecom networks in other parts of Asia in an effort to track Uighurs, China's mostly Muslim ethnic minority. So said Reuters.
■ YouTube said it was removing five times as many videos for violating its hate speech rules. Wired said this missed the point.
■ WeWork is mulling an initial public offering and thinks its business may be half as valuable as it used to be.
■ Facebook's dating app is now available to everyone in the United States. And it can integrate with Instagram. Yes, despite all the criticism, Silicon Valley continues to expand.
■ More than half of all adults in the United States believe law enforcement will use facial recognition responsibly. Do they say the same for the tech giants? Not so much, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
■ My colleague Mike Isaac's Uber book came out. It's called "Super Pumped," and you can hear him talk about it on "The Daily."

There is no telling where the man died, or exactly when, or how. But Hurricane Dorian's swirling, pounding floodwaters receded early last week to reveal his body sprawled amid the wreckage of a vast shantytown here in Marsh Harbour, the capital of the Abaco Islands.
On Sunday, a full week after the hurricane hit, the corpse was still where it had come to rest.
The extent of the damage here and elsewhere in the Abaco Islands is so great, the work of assessing it so arduous and the Bahamian government so overwhelmed that a full accounting of the missing and dead may not be known for weeks or even months.
The official death toll attributed to the hurricane remained at 44 but there is no estimate yet of how many people are unaccounted for. The Bahamian security forces are still responding to reports of missing and trapped people, officials said, and teams of forensic investigators are still combing through the storm debris.
Officials could not be reached for comment on why the bodies have not yet been collected.
But that body -- splayed on the foundation of a house that, like the rest of the neighborhood, had been turned to splinters -- was a grim reminder that there are more deaths to be counted and perhaps many more.
"Listen, it's been a week," said McAdrian Farrington. He lost his 5-year-old son and namesake when the floodwaters rose in Murphy Town, just west of Marsh Harbour, after he put the boy on the roof for safety. "Bodies are decomposing day by day."
His child's body has not been found.
Hurricanes are indiscriminate in where they strike but they often take a disproportionate toll on the poor, who may live in less resilient structures and in areas prone to flooding.
In the Abacos, among the hardest hit neighborhoods were shantytowns mostly populated by poor Haitian immigrants, many of them undocumented.
And though the government has not provided the identities of the victims, or information about where they died, many Abaconians suspect that some of the highest concentrations of fatalities will be in the sprawling, illegally constructed shantytowns of Marsh Harbour known as the Mudd and Pigeon Peas.
Thousands of people, most of them Haitian laborers and their families, lived in those two contiguous communities, labyrinths of rudimentary homes mostly built from plywood and two-by-fours.
While the Bahamas has one of the strictest building codes in the region, most if not all of the structures in the Mudd and Pigeon Peas did not adhere to them.
The hurricane last week blasted the neighborhoods' homes to pieces and reduced the area to a vast debris field of splintered wood, pulverized cinder block, twisted metal, scattered personal belongings -- and bodies.
There are still corpses pinned under fallen timber, wedged where the surging floodwaters deposited them.
And former residents know where they are.
"Do you want to see them?" asked Herbert Luberal, 47, who had lived for years in Pigeon Peas but fled when the hurricane approached. He returned this weekend to check on a friend.
Mr. Luberal turned and headed into the ruins of the neighborhood. Wearing flip-flops, he carefully picked his way through piles of battered construction material that had once been homes, and over the artifacts of lives eked out on the margins of Bahamian society: a pickax, a snorkel, chicken feed, a Haitian passport, a Winnie the Pooh backpack.
A putrid odor had settled over the neighborhood: the smell of death.
Mr. Luberal picked up a roll of toilet paper, ripped off a strand and pressed the wad against his mouth and nose.
"There," he said, pointing to a body jackknifed beneath a collapsed wall. Five yards away, the swollen foot of another corpse protruded from beneath a stack of wood topped by a stray car tire.
Two other residents -- Johnly Pierre, 47, and Ansernio Pierre, 69 -- appeared and said they knew of more. They headed deeper into the maze of half-standing structures and piles of detritus. Power cords snaked through the rubble. The neighborhood had been powered on electricity stolen from the city's grid and shared from home to home.
The men had built their own homes using whatever materials they could find.
"If you build by yourself, you can't build strong," the elder Mr. Pierre explained. "You build a little one."
One of the men pointed into a narrow passageway between two damaged homes: another corpse. Not far away was a woman's body, pinned under a piece of metal and branches torn from a tree, next to a jumble of splintered packing crates.
In a 45-minute tour that covered only a small section of the Mudd and Pigeon Peas, The New York Times saw six bodies.
"This area here?" said Mr. Pierre, 47. "Plenty dead."
The men suspected that there were more bodies that nobody had yet discovered, and the pervasive stench of rot suggested they were right.
Yet none of the men had seen government teams in the area recovering corpses.
"They don't even check it," Mr. Luberal said. "They don't care."
The government crews looking for bodies have been working in Marsh Harbour throughout the week, though it remained unclear how they chose their locations and when they planned to enter the Mudd and Pigeon Peas.
Requests for interviews with the commanders of the Royal Bahamas Police Force and Royal Bahamas Defence Force in Marsh Harbour were declined or went unanswered, and the chief governmental administrator for the region was unreachable on Sunday.
On Saturday, a forensics team of about a dozen men and women dressed in white hooded jumpsuits descended on a property near Pigeon Peas, following up on a report of bodies trapped in a collapsed church.
They pulled three bodies from the rubble, wrapped them in plastic body bags and laid them out on the back of a flatbed truck.
Minutes later, after the truck had driven away, Michelle Guerrier approached the site, flustered. She was the niece of one of the victims and knew the others, and she had hoped to bear witness to the extraction of their bodies.
"I'm late," said Ms. Guerrier, 37, a resident of Pigeon Peas. "I couldn't see them for the last time." The three victims had sought shelter in the church during the hurricane, she said.
Dejected, Ms. Guerrier turned the corner, slipped through the tangled branches of a fallen tree and into the Pigeon Peas, picking her way carefully through the wasteland of her destroyed neighborhood.

It’s The Only Hospital In Town, And Critics Say It Has Become As Proficient At Suing For Unpaid Bills As It Has At Healing

Texto completo: CARLSBAD, N.M. - The first time Carlsbad Medical Center sued Misti Price, she was newly divorced and working two jobs to support her three young children.
The hospital demanded payment in 2012 for what Price recalled as an emergency room visit for one of her children who has asthma. She could not afford a lawyer, and she did not have the money to pay the bill.
Price let the summons go unanswered, figuring she would settle the balance - with interest, about $3,600 - when she could. A few months later, she opened her paycheck and discovered the hospital had garnished her wages by $870 a month.
Her car was soon repossessed because she could no longer make the payments. She was on the verge of losing her house, too, when her mortgage company stepped in to help her save it.
“I was going to let it go,” Price said, tearing up recently in an interview at the Carlsbad Public Library. “It was tough.”
And it was only the beginning. Price, 40, a nurse and local 4-H leader, has been sued five times by Carlsbad Medical Center, for bills totaling more than $17,000.
It’s not because she and her children are uninsured; according to the hospital, the charges are what she owed after her insurer had paid. But Price said she had never received an itemized bill outlining exactly what she owed money for. The collection agency wanted the balance in full, and she was not able to work out a payment plan until after she was sued.
In this town, she has a lot of company.
Land of lawsuits
An examination of court records by The New York Times found almost 3,000 lawsuits by Carlsbad Medical Center against patients over medical debt since 2015, more than 500 of them through August of this year alone. Few hospitals sue so many patients so often.
Price’s sister, a police dispatcher, has been sued twice. Her husband has been sued. The county judge who hears many of these cases was once sued, too.
Carlsbad Medical Center is not the only hospital to have filed reams of lawsuits over unpaid bills. In Memphis, Tennessee, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, a nonprofit hospital, has filed 8,300 lawsuits in the past five years, including some against its own employees, according to an investigation by the journalism nonprofit groups ProPublica and MLK50.
In Virginia, hospitals filed more than 20,000 lawsuits over patient debt in 2017 alone, according to a study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Just five hospitals accounted for half of the resulting wage garnishments in the state.
People across the country are coping with soaring medical costs, opaque pricing and surprise bills, but these issues are felt acutely in one-hospital towns like Carlsbad, where residents have few options for care - and must pay whatever prices the hospital sets. “Hospitals that have little competition can negotiate higher rates, because the insurer wants that hospital in their network,” said Sara Collins of the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. Patient deductibles, which must be paid out of pocket, are rising for almost everyone, she added.
Nationally, more than 1 in 4 consumers in 2018 were reported to credit bureaus over unpaid debt, according to the Consumer Credit Protection Bureau. More than half of those reports involved medical bills. One survey of women with breast cancer found that a third of those with health insurance had been referred to bill collectors; among those without insurance, the number rose to 77%.
People confronted with medical debt typically drain their savings, the Commonwealth Fund has found, and 43% said it lowered their credit rating, suggesting that many of these consumers were reported to collection agencies.
Melissa Suggs, a spokeswoman for Carlsbad Medical Center, declined requests for interviews about the hospital’s debt collection practices.
“The majority of accounts from which we seek to collect payment are patients with insurance who have not fulfilled their deductible, copayment, or coinsurance responsibility set by their health insurance plan - and who have chosen not to enter into a payment arrangement for those amounts,” the hospital said in a written statement.
Following inquiries from The New York Times, the hospital said last week that it would no longer sue patients whose incomes are below 150% of the federal poverty level (roughly $19,000 for a single person), whether they have insurance or not, and would release current court judgments against any such patients.
Uninsured patients will now receive “discounts” that will bring down their bills roughly to Medicaid reimbursement rates, the hospital said.
New Mexico expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act in 2014, and almost all of these patients qualify for coverage. The state is now considering a Medicaid “buy-in” option that would further expand coverage.
A small, sun-baked town once known mostly for its nearby caverns, Carlsbad’s population has ballooned in recent years with an influx of workers drilling and fracking in the oil-rich Permian Basin.
The town’s sole hospital, Carlsbad Medical Center has long faced criticism from community leaders for high prices.
In 2013, officials of Carlsbad, which is self-insured, formed a task force called the Mayor’s Hospital Reform Committee to address the strain on its budget over health care costs for city employees. Administrators considered sending employees to neighboring towns for care before they were able to negotiate lower rates for key services.
In a presentation to the state Legislature in 2015, the mining company Intrepid Potash, a major employer in Carlsbad, calculated that it would be cheaper for one of its workers to travel to Hawaii for a gall bladder operation - including airfare for two, and a seven-day island cruise - than to get the procedure at the local hospital. The company still encourages employees to seek care out of town when possible.
Above the norm
In May, a nationwide survey by the RAND Corp. found that private insurers paid Carlsbad Medical Center five times more than Medicare would have paid for the same services - about twice the figure in the state overall.
Carlsbad Medical Center is owned by Community Health Systems, a chain of hospitals based in Franklin, Tennessee.
(Community Health Systems is the parent of Commonwealth Health, which owns six hospitals in Northeast Pennsylvania: Moses Taylor Hospital in Scranton, Regional Hospital of Scranton, Wilkes-Barre General Hospital, Berwick Hospital Center, First Hospital in Kingston and Tyler Memorial Hospital in Tunkhannock.)
An investigation in 2014 by The Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper found that the three hospitals charging the highest prices in the state were all owned by Community Health Systems.
In 2015, the company paid
$98 million to the federal government to settle charges that it had inflated revenue by admitting patients unnecessarily. Community Health Systems admitted no wrongdoing.
In 2018, a unit of the company agreed to pay $260 million to settle charges, brought by the Department of Justice, that it had systematically overbilled for emergency room visits. Company officials noted that the fraud occurred before Community Health Systems bought the subsidiary.
There are alternative hospitals near Carlsbad, but the closest is more than 40 minutes away in Artesia, which residents may find too far to drive to in an emergency. One of Price’s bills followed an emergency room visit after her daughter broke her arm on the soccer field.
“When your kid’s in pain, it’s hard to wait 45 minutes to get them there,” she said.
Artesia General has no debt-collection suits against patients on record since 2015. Neither does Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque - which, at 450 licensed beds, is almost four times as large as the hospital in Carlsbad. By contrast, other hospitals in New Mexico owned by Community Health Systems also regularly file suits over unpaid bills: Lea Regional Medical Center in Hobbs has filed almost 2,000 such suits since 2015; Mountain View Regional Medical Center in Las Cruces has filed about 2,000 suits against patients in that time, and almost half of them came just this year.
In Carlsbad, these lawsuits flood the docket. District Judge Lisa Riley, who has been on the bench in Eddy County since 2011, estimated that about one-third of all civil cases that come across her desk involve unpaid medical debt.
The overwhelming majority of lawsuits simply go into default judgment, she said, meaning that the defendants fail to respond - as was the situation in Price’s first case - and the hospital proceeds to garnish wages.
“Out of those people who do respond, which is very few, the responses almost always say, ‘I admit I owe the money and I’d like to make payment arrangements,’ or ‘I can’t afford to pay it right now,’ ” Riley said. Hearings on the hospital cases are rare. Hospital suits over unpaid debt are so frequent in Eddy County, “I had no idea that it wasn’t common practice,” Riley added. “I assumed that all hospitals did that.”
What frustrates patients is the inability to find out prices until the bill comes, even when they ask. “They say, ‘Oh, we can’t tell you until insurance pays,’ ” said Melissa Phillips, Price’s sister. “That’s the answer. Or, ‘Depends what all we have to do.’ ”

Shift from 'slave' to 'enslaved person' may be difficult, but it's important

Texto completo: I was 16 paragraphs into the powerful opening essay of The New York Times' recent 1619 Project on the 400th anniversary of chattel slavery in the United States when I realized author Nikole Hannah-Jones had studiously avoided using the term "slave."
In its place she deployed variations on "enslaved," as in the passage where she noted that the U.S. Constitution "prohibited the federal government from intervening to end the importation of enslaved Africans for a term of 20 years, allowed Congress to mobilize the militia to put down insurrections by the enslaved and forced states that had outlawed slavery to turn over enslaved people who had run away seeking refuge."
That this was a distraction for me as a reader was likely intentional.
A debate has been percolating for the last quarter-century or so -- mostly in academia -- about whether "slave" is a needlessly dehumanizing word to describe a person who was in bondage.
In a 2015 Slate essay on the subject, Katy Waldman described one side of the debate this way: "The heightened delicacy of 'enslaved person' -- the men and women it describes are humans first, commodities second -- (does) important work: restoring identity, reversing a cascade of institutional denials and obliterations," she wrote.
"To reduce the people involved to a nonhuman noun ... reproduce(s) the violence of slavery on a linguistic level; to dispense with it amount(s) to a form of emancipation."
For a counterpoint, Waldman quoted Columbia University historian Eric Foner: "Slave is a familiar word and if it was good enough for Frederick Douglass and other abolitionists who fought to end the system, it is good enough for me," he said.
"I do not think that 'slave' suggests that this is the essence of a person's being," Foner said. "It is a condition in which people (found) themselves and that severely limit(ed) their opportunities and options, but it does not mean, as some claim, that the word means they (were) nothing but slaves."
In many ways, then, the debate over "slave" is part of the larger debate over "people first" language, a movement in which advocates ask us to use circumlocutions that stress the humanity of individuals rather than their characteristics.
"Person with a disability" rather than "disabled person," for instance. Or "person living in the country illegally" rather than "illegal (or undocumented) immigrant."
Occasionally this effort veers into self-parody.
For example, Glen Koorey, a transportation and safety specialist in Christchurch, New Zealand, has long argued that the word "cyclist" conjures "images of a relatively small bunch of weird people," but the term "people who cycle" reinforces how normal most of them are.
And in July, the San Francisco Board of Examiners passed a nonbinding resolution urging city departments to begin using "people-first language with respect to people with criminal records."
Instead of "inmate," they recommended "currently incarcerated person," for example.
Instead of "juvenile offender," they recommended "young person impacted by the justice system."
And occasionally the effort backfires.
In 1993 the National Federation of the Blind passed a resolution declaring "people with blindness" to be "totally unacceptable and deserving only ridicule" because that term (and other euphemisms such as "visually impaired") "implies shame instead of true equality, and portrays the blind as touchy and belligerent."
Similarly, the National Association of the Deaf rejects the term "people with hearing loss" and notes on its website that "deaf and hard of hearing people prefer to be called 'deaf' or 'hard of hearing.' "
The NAD also frowns on "hearing impaired" because it implies that a person is "substandard, hindered, or damaged ... and ought to be fixed if possible."
A counterargument to the use of "enslaved person" for "slave" is that stressing the humanity of African Americans who were in bondage "implies a degree of autonomy that was simply never there," historian Foner said in the Slate article. Therefore, it stands to gloss over the comprehensively and grotesquely dehumanizing quality of slavery.
Yes, some people who are readers are rolling their eyes at this column and grousing to themselves about "political correctness." But that's always the first step in the transformation of language.
Many rolled their eyes when first told that "retarded" was no longer an acceptable way to refer to people with intellectual disabilities or an acceptable insult. They groused when first scolded not to say that someone is "confined to a wheelchair" or "crippled." But most got over it and have adapted.
You glossed right over my use of "African Americans" just above, didn't you?
Because you probably don't remember or even know of the eye-rolling, protestations and general huffiness that followed the December 1988 news conference at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare at which the Rev. Jesse Jackson announced that his people would now like to be called "African American" instead of "black."
"We were called 'colored,' and we're not that," Jackson said, "and then 'Negro,' and we're not that. To be called 'black' is just as baseless. To be called 'African American' has cultural integrity. It puts us in our proper historical context."
And using it has become second nature.
Most of us now effortlessly use "postal carrier," "firefighter," "flight attendant" and other nongendered terms for professions that earlier generations considered prissy and forced. And each time we do it strikes a subliminal blow against sexism.
In the same way, most of us are likely to begin saying and writing "enslaved person," if not in place of then at least interchangeably with "slave." It will become less and less distracting and more and more a tiny but healthy reminder that these men, women and children were not property that could be owned -- terminology and practice of the day notwithstanding -- but human beings with the same inherent dignity, rights and feelings as anyone else.
It's precisely because "enslaved person" is a repellent contradiction in terms that we should try to use it more often.

Texto completo: El actor Brad Pitt reveló en una entrevista con el New York Times que tras su separación de la actriz Angelina Jolie acudió a reuniones de Alcohólicos Anónimos.
"Tenías a todos estos hombres sentados, abiertos y honestos de una manera que nunca había escuchado. Era este espacio seguro donde había poco juicio hacia ti mismo", comentó.
"Fue realmente liberador sólo exponer los lados feos de uno mismo. Hay un gran valor en ello".
La estrella de Había Una Vez en... Hollywood dijo que asistió a los encuentros durante un año y medio, y añadió que, tras haber llevado lejos su problema de consumo, quería eliminar sus privilegios de beber.
También contó que el escrutinio de Hollywood y de los medios desde los años 90 creó discrepancias en sus relaciones con Jolie y Jennifer Aniston, y que nunca se sintió bien con ello.
"Fue realmente incómodo para mí, la cacofonía de las expectativas y los juicios. Realmente me convertí en una especie de ermitaño y simplemente me uní al olvido", reconoció.
Tras su divorcio de la protagonista de Maléfica, el famoso comenzó a trabajar en varios proyectos, como Ad Astra: Hacia las Estrellas, que basó en su situación actual para desempeñar su papel.
"Definitivamente utilizó los estímulos de su vida. No me volví personal con él al respecto, no creo que sea asunto mío, ni siquiera mi trabajo, pero él investigó la esencia del personaje a través de sí mismo", señaló James Gray, director del filme.
Ad Astra: Hacia las Estrellas se estrenará en México el 20 de septiembre.
Brad Pitt dijo que asistió a los encuentros durante un año y medio, y añadió que, tras haber llevado lejos su problema de consumo, quería eliminar sus privilegios de beber.

Texto completo: Sept. 11, 2001, was the day before my ninth birthday.
I don't have many memories of the day itself - I remember a friend of mine, precociously smart in the way an only child often is, saying it was Osama bin Laden (the first time I heard that name but certainly not the last). I remember several of my classmates being picked up from school early. I wasn't - my parents decided very quickly to keep the day as normal as possible for us kids. They did an amazing job of it, too, especially considering that my aunt and uncle worked in government buildings in Washington, D.C., and my mom didn't know for several hours if her sister had gotten home safely or not. (She did. We were a lucky family.)
I do remember seeing the pictures the next day, my birthday, Sept. 12. In the corner of our kitchen counter we used to have a little radio-and-TV combo (a location now occupied by an Amazon Echo - same function, same location, different tech). It had been silent, like the skies, for the past 24 hours. But that evening, right before cake-and-presents time, I went up to the counter, which was barely eye height to me, and the day's newspaper was laid out in front of it. I don't remember if it was The New York Times or the Portland Press Herald - we had subscriptions to both - but I do remember the big, above-the-fold pictures of the planes hitting the towers.
For the next 16 years I used to thank my mom for holding on one more day before giving birth to me, since it would be really awkward to have to celebrate my birthday on a national day of mourning. Mom would usually point out that it wasn't exactly her choice and that, like everything I have done since, I arrived on my own schedule.
And then 16 years later, against all odds (to be specific, the odds of 1-in-365), my dad died on Sept. 12, 2017. My 25th birthday.
So this week will be a week of mourning. There will be the 18th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, which America will mourn. In fact, my brother, who was 6 years old at the time the towers fell, will be observing this anniversary from his position aboard a Navy destroyer, deployed in the waters of the Middle East. He's 25 now. Enough time for a whole new generation of American children to grow up and go to war. I'm just about the last generation to remember 9/11 (and remember flying without having to take off your shoes or go through the full-body scanner). My sister's freshman class did a high school play about the day of the attacks, and some of the actors hadn't even been born in 2001. That was trippy. (I assume that as I continue to get older and older, these weird moments involving cultural touchstones will only increase.)
And then the day after, there will be the second anniversary of my dad's death, which will also be the day I turn 27. I still haven't decided how I feel about Sept. 12. My dad would have wanted me to be happy and to celebrate, I know, because Sept. 12, 1992, was the greatest day of his life (tied with the dates when my siblings showed up). But - well, it's hard. On Sept. 12, 2017, as we waited in the hospice for the funeral parlor to come collect his remains, my cellphone kept dinging in my purse with "Happy Birthday" greetings from Facebook. It was a little macabre.
Last year was better. I was sober, and living in a new apartment. And while whoever said "time heals all wounds" was definitely lying, the scar tissue does get thicker. And this year, I'll still be sober.
"Sober" is a good word to describe the coming week, as summer gives way to fall. Merriam-Webster's dictionary defines the adjective as meaning "marked by sedate or gravely or earnestly thoughtful character or demeanor." That seems about right. There will be a lot of red, white and blue community commemorations this week, and a lot of gray-tinged private ones. But there will still be a thousand little joys in life - leaves turning color, freshly baked cookies, an unusual bird in the front yard, what have you.
And I hope that you will find a moment to savor them.

Texto completo: The Republican parties in South Carolina and Kansas won't hold nominating contests in 2020, offering support to President Donald Trump despite fierce opposition from several GOP challengers lodging a long-shot bid for the White House.
The GOP in the deep-red state of South Carolina, which went to Trump in 2016 with about 55% of the vote, announced on Saturday it wouldn't hold a GOP primary contest for the 2020 election. Kansas' Republican party said on Friday it would not hold a caucus and explained conservatives have historically always given the state's delegates to the Republican incumbent. Officials in Nevada and Arizona are also examining the option of nixing their primaries.
"With no legitimate primary challenger and President Trump's record of results, the decision was made to save South Carolina taxpayers over $1. 2 million and forgo an unnecessary primary," said GOP state Chairman Drew McKissick in an emailed statement. "President Trump and his administration have delivered for South Carolinians, and we look forward to ensuring that Republican candidates up and down the ballot are elected in 2020. "
More: Hail to Trump: SC Republican Party cancels next year's presidential primary
Trump is officially facing GOP primary challenges from former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who announced his White House bid in April, as well as from former Rep. Joe Walsh, who announced his candidacy in August.
The announcement will affect Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor and congressman, who was also thinking about challenging Trump but postponed announcing his decision due to Hurricane Dorian. Sanford said Saturday afternoon that he was disappointed by the state party's decision to cancel its presidential primary.
"I believe that political parties are about ideas, and ideas are refined and made stronger by debate and that's what primaries are about," he said.
"The debate of ideas is part and parcel to the American way," he .
More: Here's why Mark Sanford wants to re-enter politics despite 'personal scar tissue'
While primary challenges to incumbent presidents rarely show success, news that states were debating canceling Republican primaries sent Trump's GOP challengers into a frenzy, accusing the administration of "rigging" the election.
"Remember all the times back in 2016 when Donald Trump accused the Democrats of 'rigging' the system to make sure Hillary got the nomination? I do. Well lookie here. . . the lying hypocrite is trying to 'rig' the system in 2020," Walsh wrote on Twitter.
Weld said the idea was undemocratic and accused the president of being "paranoid. "
"Donald Trump, by turns arrogant and paranoid, has made no secret of the fact that he wishes to be crowned as President rather than elected," Weld wrote on Twitter. "That might be fine in a monarchy, but we overthrew ours two centuries ago. "
State political parties set their own rules for primaries and caucuses, and one consideration when an incumbent president is seeking re-election is the costs that the state parties must bear to put on an intra-party contest when the likely outcome appears relatively clear.
It is also not an unusual move for state parties to cancel primary contests when a strong incumbent is running for re-election as president.
For example, the South Carolina and Arizona Republican parties did not hold primaries in 1984 and 2004 when Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, respectively, were seeking re-election, according to the Associated Press. In 2012, Democrats canceled 10 presidential preference contests to support Barack Obama, according to the New York Times.
The Trump campaign also pointed to a list of similar instances in past elections.
“These are decisions made entirely by state parties and there are volumes of historical precedents to support them," Trump campaign communication director Tim Murtaugh said. "Nevertheless, President Trump will dominate and prevail in whatever contest is placed before him. "

School Daze: It’s Time to Wake Up

In Spike Lee’s early film School Daze, his central character, Dap Dunlap screams “wake-up” in an effort to get members of his community to come together for a common cause. I have replayed that scene a thousand times as we discuss the issue of gun violence in our country. While horrible stories of mass shootings have plagued our headlines recently, it was a story that appeared in the New York Times in early August that started my prolonged scream within.
I expected the story to be the typical back to school fodder, but was quickly schooled on the latest item that was selling out this year…Bulletproof backpacks. Ranging in cost from $100 to $200, the piece highlighted that some stores didn’t have the protective school gear on the shelves because of the high customer demand. For those looking for other options, they could purchase what was called protective panels. In Florida, parents received their annual swag order sheet for the school….school t-shirt, winter gear and an order form for a $120 false sense of security. It’s time to wake-up.
Instead of legislators doing their jobs and working to pass laws that make sense around gun safety, children are left to fend for themselves. Well, some children, because let’s be honest, not every parent can afford the cost of these bulletproof products. But if you can, they come in the form of notebooks, computer briefcases, furniture, and even underwear.
How has this become the rationale next step in school safety? Why are we failing the residents that have placed us in these offices? More disturbing, why are people allowing legislators to get away with doing nothing? It’s time to wake-up.
When I think back to school, I think Crayola, Bic Pens, or graphing calculators. It never dawned on me that I would come to learn the name, ArmorMe, which is the name of a company run by a former Israeli commando. The owner of the company brags in an article about the company, that you can be “very stylish” while “increasing your survival chances.” Other brands, like Guard Dog Security, is sold at Office Max, Office Depot and other companies. Yet, disturbingly these products are not tested or certified by any federal agency. The makers of these products have had to admit these backpacks may not stop bullets from a high-powered semi-automatic weapon. It’s time to wake-up.
Active shooter training, armed teachers, and open carry in schools should not be the answer. No other country in this world allows their children to go to school under these circumstances. We can’t normalize these options, nor should we accept it. In early August, two mass shootings led to 31 deaths in two states in less than 24 hours. In all, 69 people have been killed in this manner, so far this year. Please wake-up.

Globe names new editorial page editor The Boston Globe on Wednesday named Bina Venkataraman as its new editorial page editor. The 39-year-old Somerville resident brings a varied background as a journalist, author, and thinker on environmental and science matters to one of the highest-profile jobs at New England's largest media company. In a statement Wednesday, Venkataraman said she wants to see the Globe amplify “diverse voices of our city and better showcase Boston's groundbreaking ideas and knowledge, while holding our leaders and institutions accountable for meeting high expectations for public service." “The Globe Opinion section has the opportunity to feature more of the voices and perspectives that hail from the many Bostons that exist today," she said. “We have the chance to reflect the richness of this region's vibrant neighborhoods and cultures, its world-class thinkers and community activists, its history-keepers and technology trailblazers." During a brief phone interview Wednesday evening, Venkataraman spoke of the importance of level-headed editorials at a time when the country is at “perhaps a historic level of political polarization." “There are a lot of opinions in our media environment right now, and a lot of people are able to offer their opinions, so it raises the bar for what we produce," she said. Venkataraman has lectured on science communication, science writing, and the shaping of science policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 2011. She is currently a fellow at the think tank New America, and the director of global policy initiatives at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. She will assume her Globe position in November. A graduate of Brown University and Harvard Kennedy School, Venkataraman has previously covered health and science for the Globe, and had stints as a Globe metro correspondent and on the Globe's editorial board. She also worked on the science desk of The New York Times. In 2013 and 2014, she served as a senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House. In announcing the hire, the Globe's managing director, Linda Henry, called the paper's editorial board “one of the strongest and most vibrant editorial boards in the country." “We tackle big issues in bold ways as well as subtle and everyday challenges," she said. “We thoughtfully look for ways to advocate, to progress, and to help others use their voices to inform and inspire others. We are thrilled and fortunate to add Bina's perspective and leadership to our board." — DANNY MCDONALD
FOOD
Nestlé plant in Taunton to close; 49 people to be laid off Nestlé USA plans to close a Taunton plant and lay off 49 employees as part of a nationwide shift in its distribution systems for frozen pizza and ice cream. The company plans to permanently close its facility at 455 John Hancock Road by year's end, according to documents filed with the state's Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development last month. All 49 employees have been notified that they will be laid off, the notice said. They include delivery drivers, retail merchandisers, and sales representatives. Layoffs will begin Oct. 18 and may continue until the site is closed, the notice said. The company's decision to transition to a warehouse model for its pizza and ice cream businesses was announced earlier this year. To save costs, Nestlé wants to ship these products — which include brands such as Dreyer's, Häagen-Dazs, and Skinny Cow — to warehouses instead of directly to stores. — SARAH WU
PHARMACEUTICALS
Vertex to acquire startup that is exploring a cure for type 1 diabetes Vertex Pharmaceuticals said Tuesday that it plans to acquire an ambitious startup for $950 million, betting the company's early-stage science could lead to a functional cure for type 1 diabetes. The Cambridge company is buying Semma Therapeutics, a nearby firm turning stem cells into insulin factories. Based on the work of Harvard University stem cell scientist Douglas Melton, Semma's approach involves turning moldable stem cells into beta cells, the insulin-producing machinery that is mistakenly attacked by the immune system in type 1 diabetes. If it works — if Semma's lab-grown beta cells can replace those lost to the disease — the company may have invented a permanent solution to a disease that affects more than 1 million people in the United States. Semma's cells would be transplanted directly into the liver or meted out by an implant, freeing patients forever from their insulin injections. But it's early days for Semma's work, which is yet to be tested in a clinical trial. And development has been a longer process than Semma anticipated. In 2015, the company raised $44 million from investors and said that money would fund its work through human trials. As of today, Semma has raised more than $100 million more and has tested its technology only on primates and pigs. — DAMIAN GARDE, STAT
FEDERAL RESERVE
Rosengren says economy should continue to grow at a healthy rate Whether you are a bull or a bear on the US economy, it's best not to get cocky. That's some advice from Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, who says that he and his fellow policy makers at the central bank should remain vigilant and ready to act at a time when risks to growth have increased. “In my view, one should not be overconfident that the economy will be just fine or that an economic downturn is inevitable," Rosengren said in a speech Tuesday evening at Stonehill College. Rosengren reiterated his view that the economy should continue to expand at a relatively healthy rate, making calls to lower interest rates premature. He was one of two Fed officials who voted against the rate cut approved at the end of July. Fed chairman Jerome Powell described that reduction, the first in a decade, as insurance against a possible recession. GDP will grow at 2 percent in the second half of the year in the United States, according to the widely followed Blue Chip consensus forecast of economists. While that is down from an average of 2.5 percent in the first six months of 2019, the pace is stronger than in other major countries and above what is called the potential growth rate, which is an estimate of the economy's maximum sustainable output over the long term. “As long as growth remains at 2 percent, I don't see the need for policy action," Rosengren said. President Trump has said the Fed should cut rates by 1 percentage point in the near term. Rosengren pointed to three reasons for increased volatility in financial markets over the summer: economic weakness in China, Japan, and Europe; disruptions in global trade caused by the US tariff war with China; and a sharp drop in long-term US government bond rates that suggests a coming slowdown. “Tariffs are a tax on imported goods and, along with the impact of retaliatory tariffs, they increase the risk that the earnings of firms reliant on foreign trade will be hurt," he said. “The reduction in earnings for these firms could affect asset valuations." — LARRY EDELMAN

Texto completo: Headnote IMMIGRATION KORNER
Ken Cuccinelli, Jr. has only been in the post of acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services since June 2019, but already, the number of extreme policy changes coming out of the agency reflects the venom this great-grandson of immigrants feels toward new immigrants in these United States.
Unfortunately for these mostly Black and Brown immigrants now, they are not like Cuccinelli's white descendants who came here with nothing. And sadly, for them as well, he now gets a national platform to implement the xenophobic policies he's always embraced as attorney general in Virginia.
Most of all, he-like Stephen Miller and the other immigration hardliners in this administration-get to please their boss, The Don, who's long held racist and anti-immigrant utterances and beliefs which can now become reality.
The attorney in Cuccinelli alas now gets to twist the laws on the book to make the case for why there is no illegality in what the administration is doing, as he delivers kick after kick to poor, frightened and now ill immigrants.
After all, he has done in before. Here's a man, who as AG in July 2010, joined eight other red states in filing an amicus brief opposing the federal government's lawsuit challenging the draconian and racist Arizona immigration law, SB1070. You will remember this rule was best known for mandating that police officers verify the immigration status of people they stop or arrest if there is "reasonable suspicion" the person was in the U.S. "illegally."
Then in August 2010, Cuccinelli also issued a legal opinion authorizing law enforcement officials to investigate the immigration status of anyone they stopped in the state. This was done previously, only for those arrested.
Cuccinelli, a master of spinning laws to suit his hardline immigration positions, noted at the time that the authority to investigate the immigration status of a stopped person should not "extend the duration of a stop by any significant degree."
Like he is doing now to circumvent legal changes to the laws at the congressional level, the opinion at the time shrewdly circumvented policy changes by legislation.
But Cuccinelli's xenophobic agenda goes back further. As a Virginia State Senator, Cuccinelli introduced a joint resolution calling on Congress to convene a constitutional convention to amend the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to eliminate birthright citizenship and only extend citizenship to people born in the U.S. who have at least one U.S. citizen parent.
Sound familiar? This exact issue was recently touted by The Don as something the administration is eyeing going after next.
But first up they have zoned in on automatic citizenship for children of certain U.S. government employees and members of the U.S. armed forces adopted or born outside of the U.S. An "update to the USCIS Policy Manual" now states that as of Oct. 29, 2019, U.S. citizen parent(s) must file and obtain a Certificate of Citizenship for their children using Form N-600K.
Cuccinelli seems to be spending his time pouring over rules in the manual and determining how to slyly change them unilaterally without much communication with USICE or other agencies. He has also now decided that immigrants battling severe illnesses, who would ordinarily be given special, temporary protection from deportation, will no longer be so "lucky."
Instead, the USCIS has sent letters to parents of these ill children, telling them they must leave the U.S. within 33 days. And to make matters worse, much like this administration has done before with the botched child separation policy, the USCIS claimed falsely that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will now oversee the "medical deferred action" program.
Yet, ICE officials have admitted to The New York Times that they have "no idea" about the change, nor is it prepared to handle the new responsibility.
Homicidal! That's the only word that sums it all up. Cuccinelli and The Don may be riding high now on their xenophobic wagon, but their day of reckoning will soon come. The tears of too many immigrants have fallen because of them and that is never a good thing in the long run.

Texto completo: Remember when trade wars were good, and easy to win? President Donald Trumps glib declaration has now been replaced by a new one, from his Senate surrogate, Lindsey Graham: Americans should accept the pain of Trumps trade war with China.
That pain is felt largely (though not solely) by farmers  many of whom count themselves among Trumps base. This presidents arrogance and incompetent handling of trade negotiations has put farmers in a lurch, while threatening the strong economy Trump likes to brag so much about. At this rate, Democrats could discover the 2020 election is easy to win.
Contrary to his claims, Trumps decision to blow up Americas trade relationship with the worlds most populous country wasnt forced by Chinas trade practices. While those practices have been unfair, thats an issue for the bargaining table, not the front lines of a trade war. Trump made a unilateral decision to start that war, based on his belligerent worldview that life is a zero-sum endeavor: For someone to win, someone else has to lose.
In fact, free trade at its best is a positive for all sides. That was certainly true for Americas farmers, who for years have supplied China with the soybeans and other crops it needs. Its been a huge, stable market. But stability doesnt impress this president. He prefers chaos. And now he has it.
Trump last year began imposing tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, falsely declaring that China would have to pay those costs. But tariffs are paid by the importers  generally, American companies, who pass the cost onto American consumers  a fact Trump either didnt understand or hoped Americans didnt.
In any case, even as prices of manufactured goods in the U.S. are rising as a result, Chinas utterly predictable retaliatory tariffs are devastating American farmers. Total U.S. agricultural exports to China, which stood at $24 billion in 2014, fell to just over $9 billion last year, as those buyers turn to other countries for their crops. Theres a real danger that, once Trumps trade war is finally over, those new trade relationships will have gelled, leaving U.S. farmers permanently frozen out.
As if to admit how damaging this policy has been, the administration has thrown $28 billion in financial aid at farmers  money American taxpayers also have to foot instead of Chinese markets. Even so, farm bankruptcies are sharply up. No wonder, as The New York Times reports, that farmers at a Minnesota gathering last month roundly booed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.
Trade wars arent good and, as Americas farmers and consumers are learning, there are generally no winners. Trumps reelection strategy has been to take credit for economic growth he inherited; voters next year should make sure he also gets credit for the trade chaos created entirely on his watch.

Google fined $170 million for tracking of children

Texto completo: Google agreed Wednesday to pay a record $170 million fine and to make changes to protect children’s privacy on YouTube, as regulators said the video site had knowingly and illegally harvested personal information from children and used it to profit by targeting them with ads.
Critics denounced the agreement, dismissing the fine as paltry and the required changes as inadequate for protecting children’s privacy.
The penalty and changes were part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and New York’s attorney general, which had accused YouTube of violating the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.
Regulators said that YouTube, which is owned by Google, had illegally gathered children’s data — including identification codes used to track web browsing over time — without their parents’ consent.
The site also marketed itself to advertisers as a top destination for young children, even as it told some advertising firms that they did not have to comply with the children’s privacy law because YouTube did not have viewers younger than 13. YouTube then made millions of dollars by using the information harvested from children to target them with ads, regulators said.
To settle the charges, YouTube agreed to the $170 million penalty, with $136 million going to the trade commission and $34 million to New York state. It is the largest civil penalty ever obtained by the trade commission in a children’s privacy case, dwarfing the previous record fine of $5.7 million against the owner of social video-sharing app TikTok this year.
Under the settlement, which the FTC approved in a 3-2 vote, YouTube also agreed to create a system that asks video channel owners to identify the children’s content they post so that targeted ads are not placed in such videos. YouTube must also obtain consent from parents before collecting or sharing personal details like a child’s name or photos, regulators said.
The move is the latest enforcement action taken by regulators in the United States against technology companies for violating users’ privacy, indicating the Trump administration’s willingness to aggressively pursue the powerful corporations. It follows a $5 billion privacy settlement between the trade commission and Facebook in July over how the company collected and handled user data.
But critics of the settlement, including Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., described the $170 million penalty as a slap on the wrist for one of the world’s richest companies.
“The FTC let Google off the hook with a drop-in-the-bucket fine and a set of new requirements that fall well short of what is needed to turn YouTube into a safe and healthy place for kids,” Markey said in a statement.
Children’s advocates who lodged their own privacy complaint against YouTube with the FTC last year said that Google had simply agreed to abide by a children’s privacy law it was already obligated to comply with. COPPA prohibits operators of online services from collecting personal data, like home addresses, from children younger than 13 without a parent’s verifiable permission.
“Merely requiring Google to follow the law, that’s a meaningless sanction,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group whose efforts in the 1990s helped lead to the passage of the children’s privacy law. “It’s the equivalent of a cop pulling somebody over for speeding at 110 miles an hour, and they get off with a warning.”
The agreement split the trade commission along partisan lines, with the agency’s three Republican commissioners voting to approve it and the two Democratic commissioners dissenting.
In a statement, two of the Republican commissioners, Joseph J. Simons, the agency’s chairman, and Christine S. Wilson, said that the settlement “achieves a significant victory for the millions of parents whose children watch child-directed content on YouTube.” They said it was the first time a platform would have to ask its content producers to identify themselves as creators of children’s material. The agreement, they added, “sends a strong message to children’s content providers and to platforms about their obligation to comply with the COPPA rule.”
Although the settlement prohibits YouTube and Google from using or sharing children’s data they have already obtained, Rohit Chopra, a Democratic commissioner, said that it did not hold company executives personally accountable for illegal mining of children’s data. The other Democratic commissioner, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, said that the agreement did not go far enough by requiring YouTube itself to proactively identify children’s videos on its platform.
“No individual accountability, insufficient remedies to address the company’s financial incentives, and a fine that still allows the company to profit from its lawbreaking,” Chopra wrote in his dissent. “The terms of the settlement were not even significant enough to make Google issue a warning to its investors.”
In a blog post Wednesday about the settlement, YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, said that “nothing is more important than protecting kids and their privacy.” She added, “From its earliest days, YouTube has been a site for people over 13, but with a boom in family content and the rise of shared devices, the likelihood of children watching without supervision has increased.”
YouTube said that not only had it agreed to stop placing targeted ads on children’s videos, it would also stop gathering personal data about anyone who watched such videos, even if the company believed that the viewer was an adult. The company also said it would eliminate features on children’s videos, like comments and notifications, that involved the use of personal data.
In addition to relying on reports from video creators, Wojcicki said that YouTube planned to use artificial intelligence to try to identify content that targeted young audiences, like videos featuring children’s toys, games or characters.
Under the settlement, YouTube must adopt the changes by early next year.
The privacy case against YouTube began in 2016 after the New York attorney general’s office, which has been active in enforcing the federal children’s privacy law in the state, notified the trade commission about apparent violations of the law on the site.
“Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,” Letitia James, New York’s attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. “These companies put children at risk and abused their power.”
Google has been forced to deal with privacy violations repeatedly in recent years. The company is subject to a 20-year federal consent order signed in 2011 for deceptive data-mining related to Buzz, a now-defunct social network. The order required Google to establish a comprehensive privacy program and prohibited it from misrepresenting how it handles personal data.
In 2012, Google agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle trade commission charges that it had violated the 2011 order by deceiving users of Apple’s Safari browser about its data-mining practices.
The company is also the subject of a lawsuit brought by Hector Balderas, New Mexico’s attorney general, over accusations that it violated children’s privacy. The suit says the company failed to ensure that children’s apps available through its Google Play store complied with the children’s privacy law. Google has asked that the case be dismissed.
The settlement Wednesday is likely to have implications beyond YouTube. The changes required under the agreement could limit how much video makers earn on the platform because while they still make money on some kinds of ads on children’s videos, they will no longer be able to profit from ads targeted at children.
To offset some of the expected losses, YouTube said it would funnel $100 million to creators of children’s content over the next three years. It said it would also heavily promote YouTube Kids, its child-focused app, to shift parents away from using the main YouTube app when allowing their children to watch videos.
The crackdown on creators of children’s content could make it financially difficult to produce such videos, said Maureen Ohlhausen, a former acting chairwoman of the trade commission.
“There is a lot of free content available for children,” she said. “You want to be sure that you don’t kill the goose that lays the golden egg.”

Texto completo: Swimming pool, billiards room, tennis courts, custom canine kennels replete with vigas - no, we're not describing the latest posh resort in Northern New Mexico. This sprawling Santa Fe enclave dates to the early 20th century when two socialite sisters, Elizabeth and Martha White, descended upon the city during a cross-country road trip and looked to get their hair done, but instead decided living there surpassed their need for a proper shampoo.
As frivolous as this may sound, the White sisters were far from scatterbrained.
The two remained in Santa Fe and established themselves as among its most influential, albeit anonymous, philanthropists. And Paul Figueroa, the program chair of the Taos County Historical Society, thinks it's time for you to hear the White sisters' amazing story.
Join him Saturday (Sept. 7) at 2 p.m. when special guest lecturer Dr. Nancy Owen Lewis presents "The Artistry of El Delirio: The White Sisters' Remarkable Legacy" at the Kit Carson Co-op Boardroom.
Learn about the Whites' journey from a privileged life in New York City to their graduation from the illustrious liberal arts college, Bryn Mawr, where the notion that women's roles in society could be powerful, substantive and based upon social justice and reform was accepted as truth. The two wealthy young ladies first demonstrated their embrace of empowerment by volunteering as nurses in Europe during World War I.
Follow them as they built a home they named El Delirio ("The Madness") on Garcia Street, Santa Fe, which expanded over time as they acquired the property to do so. Be entertained by the stories of their lavish costume parties to which the creme of Santa Fe society were invited, held poolside -- the city's first -- at their home.
Then, absorb the enormous endowment of these sisters, which remains a powerful force in the city decades after their deaths.
"The two, and other Bryn Mawr graduates who relocated to Santa Fe, successfully defeated the Bursum Bill, whose effective purpose was to steal Pueblo land from the Natives," said Figueroa. "In addition to preserving this land they fought for centuries of Native art and culture and awareness of it throughout the rest of the country, and even donated the land that the Wheelwright Museum [of the American Indian] was built on."
The sisters never married but did love their Irish wolfhounds and Afghans, several of which were bred from pups by the comic actors the Marx Brothers. When younger Martha died of cancer in 1937, Elizabeth continued work in Martha's memory, funding Santa Fe's first animal shelter and working with the U.S. Army to develop World War II's sentry "Dogs for Defense" program here in New Mexico.
She also continued their work with the Indian Arts Fund, the Old Santa Fe Association and the DeVargas Development Company, among other civic organizations. And upon her death in 1972, Elizabeth bequeathed El Delirio to the internationally recognized School for Advanced Research, still its present location and where lecturer Lewis remains a scholar-in-residence after a 20-year career with the institution.
"When I was hired by SAR, part of my responsibilities was to conduct tours of the campus. I, like our visitors, was intrigued by the idiosyncrasies of the property, like the dog cemetery. The more I delved into the White sisters' story, the more fascinated I became," Lewis said.
"Yes, they were very social and loved a good party, but what's extraordinary is how they parlayed those contacts and their own personal wealth into such an enormous body of philanthropic work. When Martha was still alive, they were a powerhouse of reform in Native issues. After Martha's death, Elizabeth continued that work and also took up animal welfare and related issues," Lewis continued.
Lewis, herself, has fond memories of the many days spent at her grandparents' cattle ranch in New Mexico, though she grew up in the Midwest. Having attended the University of New Mexico, she received her doctoral degree in anthropology from the University of Massachusetts. "My parents had since built a home in Santa Fe and I knew I wanted to move here, but not without a job."
Lewis' ultimate pathway to that job is as colorful a story as the White sisters'. "I had been contacted in 1980 to look into cattle mutilations happening in Arkansas, and from there I contacted Ken Rommel, the district attorney from New Mexico's 1st Judicial District, who was investigating the same issue here." Her research and opinions on the matter had The New York Times pursuing her, and, "I had mobile television vans in my driveway."
She was even named to U.S. President Bill Clinton's cattle mutilation investigatory council. "No," she laughed, "we didn't find UFOs or the devil at work." But her work on this issue landed her a role in investigating the notorious New Mexico State Penitentiary riot of the same year. "That led to work in witness security and the municipal courts. When SAR advertised a vacancy for director of scholar programs I said to myself, 'Time to get back to anthropology.'"
The lecturer is the author of two well-received books and a myriad of research papers. She is currently working on her third book, via grants from the Office of the State Historian, on Elizabeth' White's "Dogs for Defense" program.
"It's amazing, if you think about it, how much influence women have had in New Mexico's history," Figueroa mused.
Lewis said, "Maybe not. New Mexico has always had some of the strongest rights for women, including being able to inherit property. Of course, that attracted women from all over and brought us the best."
Sponsored in part by the Historical Society of New Mexico and its Speakers' Bureau, the free program, open to the public, promises to be a thoroughly enjoyable round of anecdotes, historical images and questions and answers.
"The Artistry of El Delirio: The White Sisters' Remarkable Legacy" takes place in the Kit Carson Electric Cooperative Boardroom, 118 Cruz Alta Road, Taos. For more information, call (575) 779-8579 or visit taoscountyhistoricalsociety.org.

Texto completo: Go ahead and forgive yourself if you find some details of Vice President Mike Pence’s visit to Ireland confusing.
Although Pence has official meetings in Dublin (on Ireland’s east coast) he and his federal entourage have found lodging in Doonbeg (on Ireland’s west coast). Why Doonbeg? Well, Pence has ancestral ties to Doonbeg, about which he waxed poetic on Tuesday as he explained his decision to burden his team and U.S. taxpayers by staying 125 miles away from Dublin. Even better: Donald Trump owns a hotel and golf course in Doonbeg, which Pence also found inviting.
“If you have a chance to get to Doonbeg you’ll find it’s a fairly small place,” Pence told reporters. “The opportunity to stay at Trump National in Doonbeg, to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical.”
Did the fact that his boss owns a hotel in Ireland figure into the mix, and might the president have suggested that Pence patronize a Trump property? Yes - Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters as much.
“I don’t think it was a request, like a command. It’s like, ‘Well, you should stay at my place,’” Short said. “It wasn’t like a, ‘You must.’ It wasn’t like, ‘You have to.’”
But by late Tuesday night, Pence’s team had backed off that thought. “We want to clarify that the decision to stay at Trump International in Doonbeg, Ireland was solely the decision of the office of the vice president,” Pence’s advisers told a New York Times reporter. “At no time did the president direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort and any reporting to the contrary is false.”
Perhaps Pence’s staff pulled an about-face regarding Doonbeg because even a mini-controversy raises the specter of the president and his sidekick skirting the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clauses.
Trump flagrantly ignored his own conflicts of interest during his presidential bid and then allowed an overt, slow-motion grift to continue the moment he moved into the Oval Office. Some of the more brazen members of Trump’s team fell by the wayside - think of Tom Price, Ryan Zinke and Scott Pruitt - when they got caught scooping up too much for themselves. Pence seems to understand that his survival hinges on giving, not taking.
Doonbeg isn’t the first time that Pence has managed to channel money to Trump. Pence’s political committee, the Great America Committee, has spent approximately $224,000 since 2017 at Trump Organization properties. Pence’s brother, a freshman congressman, also has been a heavy spender at Trump’s Washington hotel. Since 2015, political groups, largely Republican, have spent about $20 million at Trump hotels. In 2018 alone, foreign governments spent $1 million at Trump properties, and mainly at the president’s Washington hotel.
Attorney General William Barr may spend at least $30,000 to throw a holiday party at Trump’s Washington hotel in December. A Justice Department official told the Washington Post that other major hotels were booked and that “the purpose of Barr’s party wasn’t to curry favor with the president.”
Barr already has curried ample favor with Trump by running interference for him before and after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report became public. But the president keeps you around if you do as he does. Trump himself recently suggested that next year’s Group of Seven diplomatic summit would do well to make its way to his Doral resort in Florida, so it’s not hard to discern where the Mike Pences and the Bill Barrs of the world might be getting their cues.
Pence and Barr also are well aware of the power of public perception. And they shouldn’t kid themselves that lining the president’s wallet isn’t unseemly and corrosive, even if it’s perfectly legal.

Texto completo: SANTA CRUZ >> Untold heartbreak and grief permeated communities across Santa Cruz and the Bay Area as authorities revealed that most of the victims of Monday's devastating diving boat fire off the Channel Islands were from Northern California.
Hope that anyone beyond five crew members had escaped the inferno was extinguished early Tuesday as the Coast Guard ended its search for survivors from the 75-foot vessel Conception, effectively affirming that 34 people out of the 39 total passengers and crew died in the disaster.
Among those victims were five members of a Stockton family, a Fremont physics teacher and two Santa Cruz high school students, according to accounts from family and friends that emerged as authorities worked to identify the dead.
"The majority of the people on this trip appeared to have been from the Santa Cruz-San Jose-Bay Area region," Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said at a news conference Tuesday.
The National Transportation Safety Board has joined the U.S. Coast Guard in investigating the cause of the fire, which broke out around 3 a.m. Monday, trapping sleeping passengers below deck.
There was "no indication at all" that any of those people were able to escape, Brown said, after the fire apparently blocked both of the exit points out of the quarters.
Search crews have recovered the bodies of 20 people, 11 female and nine male, Brown said. Divers spotted five bodies still inside the boat late Monday but were unable to immediately recover them. Nine people still had not been located as of Tuesday evening.
Brown said officials are still collecting information about the ages and hometowns of the victims, adding that they are now asking family members for DNA samples to confirm those victims' identities.
Coast Guard Capt. Monica Rochester said crews suspended their search for survivors around 9:40 a.m. Tuesday after they did not see new signs of distress or debris. After seven rescue missions spread over 24 hours, scouring an area of about 160 square miles, Coast Guard crews now have shifted their efforts to finding remains and recovering the vessel.
"Our hearts, our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victims," Rochester said.
'BLOCKED BY FIRE'
Only five crew members, whose quarters were above the boat's deck on the highest of its three levels, were able to escape, making their way to a nearby pleasure vessel, The Grape Escape, according to the Coast Guard. Two had minor injuries.
Bob and Shirley Hansen, who own The Grape Escape, told The New York Times they were asleep when they heard pounding on the side of their vessel about 3:30 a.m. That's when they said they saw Conception completely engulfed.
"I could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat," Bob Hansen said. There were these explosions every few beats. You can't prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous."
Brown said that some of the explosions that occurred on the vessel may have been exploding scuba or propane tanks.
Authorities still are investigating how the victims died, Brown said, adding that DNA testing was needed because some of the bodies were badly burned in what he described as an "extraordinarily hot fire."
"It is appearing as though the people who were below deck were trapped and unable to exit the vessel," he said. "There was a stairwell to get down the main entryway up and down and there was an escape hatch. And it would appear as though both of those were blocked by fire."
WELL-KNOWN DIVE BOAT
The Conception which was was based in Santa Barbara Harbor and owned by a local company, Truth Aquatics had departed Friday on a three-day excursion to Channel Islands National Park. A memorial outside Truth Aquatics in Santa Barbara Harbor grew Tuesday as mourners came to pay their respects.
Charles McKinven, manager of Sunnyvale-based Pacific Scuba Divers, said he had been aboard Conception in the past and noted the popular vessel was well-known among California divers.
"If you talk to any diver in the area who's dived the Channel Islands, they've been on that boat," McKinven said, adding that two of the boat fire victims were longtime patrons of the Sunnyvale dive shop.
McKinven said a tragedy on this scale is virtually unheard of in diving.
"I think everybody pretty much is in shock that something like this could happen to such a big group of divers, in general," he said. "I've been diving for 40-odd years, I've been teaching for 20 of those. I've never heard of an incident like this with a dive boat before."
LEARNING OF VICTIMS
As hope dwindled that any passengers would be found alive Tuesday, names of victims began to emerge on social media Tuesday, as hope dwindled that any of the missing passengers would be found alive.
Pacific Collegiate School in Santa Cruz confirmed that two students and the parents of one student were aboard the Conception.
"Our hearts and thoughts are with the families of the victims and those yet missing, particularly those of our students and parents on board," head of school Maria C. Reitano wrote in a statement. "Right now, our priority as a school community is to support our students, staff, and families in the wake of this tragedy."
In Fremont, the school district said that American High School physics teacher Scott Chan was among the victims.
Diving instructor Kristy Finstad, whose Santa Cruz-based company Worldwide Diving Adventures chartered the boat, was also on board the vessel, according to a Facebook post by her brother, Brett Harmeling.
Three sisters, their father and their stepmother also were on the diving trip and were among those unaccounted for after the fire, according to a Facebook post Tuesday morning from their mother, Susana Solano Rosas, whose social media accounts identified her as a nurse for the Stockton Unified School District. The family had been celebrating their father's birthday.
Rosas' husband, Chris Rosas, said Tuesday afternoon that he and his wife along with other relatives of the victims were still waiting for more information from authorities.
"We're in Santa Barbara with all the other people who lost someone in the accident," Chris Rosas said. "We're all talking to each other, just being together."

New York City wants to get rid of academic programs for gifted students

Texto completo: New York City desperately wants to be the foremost champion of equality — so much so that it’s willing to handicap its gifted students.

Concerned with a lack of integration in the city’s public schools, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed a task force to develop proposals that could change this. The council reported back to de Blasio last week with its primary proposal: the elimination of selective admissions and programs for gifted and talented students.

“The existing use of screens and Gifted and Talented programs is unfair, unjust and not necessarily research-based ... These programs segregate students by race, class, abilities and language and perpetuate stereotypes about student potential and achievement,” de Blasio’s “School Diversity Advisory Group” claimed.
According to New York’s education demagogues, programs for gifted students tend to favor children from wealthier, white families and must therefore be eliminated if diversity is to remain the school system’s top priority. The solution, then, is to phase out gifted and talented programs, which accept children as young as 4 years old, and replace them with “pro-integrative programs” that “affirmatively attract students of all backgrounds and make sure that all students are challenged.”
At face value, the council’s goal seems reasonable, as Frederick Hess, the director of education policy for the American Enterprise Institute, notes. Surely every school hopes to see each of its students succeed equally, and any program that helps them do so should be praised.
“This is not about lowering the bar, it’s about giving all of our students what they need to meet the bar," Richard Carranza, the city schools chancellor, said, according to the New York Times.
But it’s not that simple. No student is the same. Children want different things and each learns differently, Hess says. No matter who teaches them, some will exceed expectations while others fall behind.
Gifted programs aren’t perfect, as Laura Moser noted for Slate several years ago. They can be corrupted by influential parents hoping to give their children a leg up, and the standards for selection are often unclear. But gifted programs do help students with a natural desire to learn by challenging them more than normal classrooms would. They exist for the same reason Advanced Placement courses exist in public high schools: Some students want and need to be pushed, and as a result, they are rewarded with college credit.
Think about it like a tiered sport: At most schools, there are two (sometimes more) teams for individual sports, such as soccer. The varsity team is the best. It’s the one every student athlete strives for, but only the best make. This isn’t considered unusual or discriminatory. So why should an academic varsity team be any different? Apparently, because diversity said so.

This is what happens when diversity dictates the entire conversation. Everything must bow to diversity, even education, ostensibly the top priority of schools. It is the defining standard — really, the only standard — and the Left uses it relentlessly, in this case suppressing some students' opportunities for the sake of inclusivity.
De Blasio hasn’t endorsed his council’s proposal yet, and he shouldn’t. Educational excellence should be encouraged in every household it’s found in, regardless of skin color or pay grade. New York City’s students deserve that much.

Texto completo: Obama White House counsel Greg Craig was found not guilty Wednesday of misleading Justice Department investigators.
The verdict came after less than a day of jury deliberations in the trial spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

The 74-year-old, who worked in President Barack Obama’s administration during his first term and also helped President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings, was the highest-profile Democrat to face charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any connections with the Trump campaign.
The trial lasted more than two weeks and included a day and a half of testimony from the high-powered Democratic lawyer himself, but the jury began deliberations just on Wednesday morning and delivered its verdict acquitting him in the early afternoon.
Craig had been charged with scheming against DOJ investigators about contacts with the media in promoting a 2012 report written at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine about the country’s prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was tried under President Viktor Yanukovych. The president was a close ally of Republican operative Paul Manafort, the chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign, who was convicted of crimes in Mueller’s investigation. Manafort was Craig’s contact with Ukraine, and Craig’s case spun off from Mueller’s inquiry.
The DOJ’s case against Craig focused on the public relations work allegedly performed for Ukraine by Craig and his firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom. Specifically, the DOJ alleged that Craig helped Ukraine carry out its media strategy when he provided an early copy of the report to New York Times reporter David Sanger.
But Craig’s lawyers argued that he didn’t lie and that his only involvement in media outreach was to stop the whitewashing of the conclusions of his report by Ukraine or people working for Manafort, such as right-hand man Rick Gates and publicist Jonathan Hawker.
Prosecutors said Craig "schemed, falsified, and concealed,” facts from the DOJ’s Foreign Agents Registration Act unit in 2013. The foreign agents law mandates anyone working for a foreign government register with DOJ. Craig denied helping Ukraine advance its agenda.
Wednesday's not guilty verdict is a setback to the DOJ as it seeks to enforce FARA more broadly, following a successful prosecution against Manafort and others.
DOJ’s FARA unit exchanged letters with Craig in 2013 and, based on his initial responses, concluded he needed to register under the law. Craig disagreed, saying he might appeal this all the way to then-Attorney General Eric Holder.
DOJ brought Craig in to meet with the FARA unit in October 2013. Craig sent DOJ his summation of the meeting shortly after, and DOJ reversed itself and concluded Craig didn’t have to register after all. Mueller revived the case amid renewed scrutiny of Manafort. But no one took any notes during the crucial 2013 meeting at DOJ, and no investigators could specifically quote anything Craig said then.
The defense criticized DOJ for this oversight in closing arguments Tuesday.
“This is the most important meeting in the recent history of FARA, and no one took any notes,” Craig’s attorney said.
Craig’s lawyers agreed that “a person has a duty to be truthful” but insisted that “Mr. Craig did not lie to the FARA unit and did not conceal anything.”
But prosecutors pointed to a number of controversies yesterday they believed Craig should have told the FARA unit about. The first was Craig’s apparent willingness to sign onto “Project Two” — helping advise Ukraine on its planned second prosecution of Tymoshenko — which Skadden initially signed onto before backing away. Prosecutors also believed the FARA unit should’ve been told about Manafort’s involvement in the Skadden's project and about the source of the project’s funding, as $4 million came from Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchuk.
“This is why FARA matters,” prosecutors told the jury. “All of this would’ve come out, but none of it did at the time.”
But Craig’s lawyers questioned who cared about any of those issues, saying that Project Two was abandoned early on, claiming Manafort wasn’t known in 2012 or 2013 as the nefarious character he is today, and arguing Craig himself wanted Pinchuk’s identity made public.
“Mr. Craig didn’t want to register because he didn’t think he was required to register,” Craig’s lawyers said.
The charges carried a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Timothy L. O’Brien: Mike Pence’s Doonbeg visit proves he’s a giver

Texto completo: Go ahead and forgive yourself if you find some details of Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Ireland confusing.
Although Pence has official meetings in Dublin (on Ireland's east coast) he and his federal entourage have found lodging in Doonbeg (on Ireland's west coast). Why Doonbeg? Well, Pence has ancestral ties to Doonbeg, about which he waxed poetic on Tuesday as he explained his decision to burden his team and U.S. taxpayers by staying 125 miles away from Dublin. Even better: Donald Trump owns a hotel and golf course in Doonbeg, which Pence also found inviting.
"If you have a chance to get to Doonbeg you'll find it's a fairly small place," Pence told reporters. "The opportunity to stay at Trump National in Doonbeg, to accommodate the unique footprint that comes with our security detail and other personnel, made it logical."
Logic may not have been the only factor at work when Pence pondered accommodations. Did the fact that his boss owns a hotel in Ireland figure into the mix, and might the president have suggested that Pence patronize a Trump property? Yes, it would seem -- and we know that because Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, told reporters as much on Tuesday morning.
"I don't think it was a request, like a command... It's like, 'Well, you should stay at my place,'" Short said. "It wasn't like a, 'You must.' It wasn't like, 'You have to.'"
But by late Tuesday night, Pence's team had backed off that thought. "We want to clarify that the decision to stay at Trump International in Doonbeg, Ireland was solely the decision of the Office of the Vice President," Pence's advisers told a New York Times reporter, Maggie Haberman. "At no time did the President direct our office to stay at his Doonbeg resort and any reporting to the contrary is false."
The Trump White House, which remains mired in chaos, congressional investigations and financial conflicts of interest, has made a habit of dissembling, lying or contradicting itself. Perhaps Pence's staff pulled an about-face regarding Doonbeg because even a mini-controversy raises the specter of the president and his sidekick skirting the U.S. Constitution's emoluments clauses. "Emolument" is, essentially, an 18th century word for "bribery" and the clauses aim to keep federal leaders honest by forbidding them from taking gifts, money or other freebies from foreign or domestic entities. In short, they enshrine the quaint notion that good government and good policy is built on ethical leadership.
I don't imagine, though, that Trump and Pence are overly worried about emoluments violations. Trump flagrantly ignored his own conflicts of interest during his presidential bid and then allowed an overt, slow-motion grift to continue the moment he moved into the Oval Office. Some of the more brazen members of Trump's team fell by the wayside -- think of Tom Price, Ryan Zinke and Scott Pruitt -- when they got caught scooping up too much for themselves. Pence hasn't made that mistake. He seems to understand that his survival hinges on giving, not taking.
Doonbeg isn't the first time that Pence has managed to channel money to Trump. Pence's political committee, the Great America Committee, has spent approximately $224,000 since 2017 at Trump Organization properties, according to the Daily Beast and ProPublica. (Pence's brother, a freshman congressman, has also been a heavy spender at Trump's Washington hotel, according to USA Today.) Since 2015, political groups, largely Republican, have spent about $20 million at Trump hotels according to the Center for Responsive Politics and the New York Times. In 2018 alone, foreign governments spent $1 million at Trump properties, and mainly at the president's Washington hotel, according to the Washington Post.
Attorney General William Barr is in on the action as well. He may spend at least $30,000 to throw a holiday party at Trump's Washington hotel in December. A Justice Department official told the Washington Post that Barr was forced to hold his bash there because other major hotels were already booked and that "the purpose of Barr's party wasn't to curry favor with the president."
Barr has already curried ample favor with Trump by running interference for him before and after former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign became public. So perhaps he doesn't need to patronize a Trump hotel as well to stay in the president's good graces. But as all of those who survive in Trump's White House know, the president keeps you around if you do as he does. Trump himself recently suggested that next year's Group of Seven diplomatic summit would do well to make its way to his Doral resort in Florida -- in what would be an unabashed mingling of his public duties with his private fortunes -- so it's not hard to discern where the Mike Pences and the Bill Barrs of the world might be getting their cues.
Pence and Barr are also adults and are well aware of the power of public perception. And whether it's in Doonbeg or in Washington, they shouldn't kid themselves that lining the president's wallet isn't unseemly and corrosive, even if it's perfectly legal.

Manafort looms large as case against Obama counsel Greg Craig finishes today

Texto completo: Paul Manafort loomed large throughout the two-week trial against Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, whose business dealings with Ukraine drew scrutiny from the Justice Department, with closing arguments from prosecution and defense happening Tuesday.
Craig, 74, is charged with misleading DOJ investigators about his role promoting a report written at the behest of the Kremlin-linked government in Ukraine about the country’s controversial prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who was tried under President Viktor Yanukovych, a close Manafort ally.
Manafort, a lobbyist and Republican operative, was chairman of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and was convicted of a host of crimes in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. Manafort was Craig’s contact with Ukraine, and Craig’s case spun off from Mueller’s inquiry.
The DOJ’s case against Craig focuses on the public relations work allegedly performed for Ukraine and Manafort by Craig and the law firm he worked for — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom — throughout 2012.
Craig took the stand for a day and a half, claiming he didn’t lie and that his only involvement in media outreach was to stop the whitewashing of the conclusions of his report by Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice or people working for Manafort, such as right-hand man Rick Gates and publicist Jonathan Hawker. Craig claimed he wanted his report to be portrayed accurately in the media.
“I did not think correcting misinformation crossed any line or made me an agent of Ukraine,” Craig said.
Craig agreed Manafort often called the shots, pointing out many decisions were made by Manafort. The prosecutor said Manafort was “pulling the purse strings.”
“The payment schedule was established by Mr. Manafort,” Craig replied.
Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch, paid more than $4 million for the project, despite Ukraine initially claiming Skadden was hired for $12,000. Craig threatened to walk away unless Skadden received $2 million up front.
“It was Pinchuk’s money, but it was transferred through Manafort,” Craig testified.
Prosecutors said Craig “schemed, falsified, and concealed” facts from then-head of DOJ’s Foreign Agents Registration Act enforcement unit, Heather Hunt, in 2013. The "scheme" related to the foreign agents law, which mandates anyone working on behalf of a foreign government register with the DOJ.
Hunt, Hawker, and Gates were key witnesses against Craig during the trial.
Prosecutors say Craig was especially deceptive about his interactions with David Sanger of the New York Times, pointing out Craig offered Sanger the report ahead of its release, emailed it to him and hand-delivered a copy to his home, and did an interview with him and other reporters.
With help from Craig and Manafort, the Skadden report made its way to various people connected to the U.S. government. When the report was released, the State Department was critical of it, believing it soft-peddled Yanukovych’s abuse of power.
Manafort praised Craig for his media help, saying that “the initial rollout has been very effective and your backgrounding has been key to it all.”
“I thought my backgrounding had been critical of Ukraine,” Craig testified.
Craig did admit one of his letters to DOJ’s FARA unit got a significant date wrong. Craig told investigators Skadden didn’t contact the media until Dec. 12, 2012, when he’d reached out to Sanger on Dec. 11, 2012.
“Going back and reviewing it, I wish we’d put December 11 in there rather than December 12,” Craig said.
DOJ claimed Craig was trying to avoid registering under FARA because he was worried about hurting his future job prospects. Craig didn’t see himself as an agent of Ukraine.
“If we also registered as an agent for Ukraine at the same time we were writing this report, that was saying we could not do this independently,” he said. “It’s sort of a Catch-22. If you register, that means you’re a foreign agent under the direction of a foreign sovereign.”
Craig denied helping Ukraine advance its agenda.
“I did not — quite the contrary,” Craig testified. “I was not acting in the interests of Ukraine. I was trying to defend the accuracy of the report.”
Prosecutors grilled Craig about his efforts to get an extra $1.25 million from Ukraine and his agreement to backdate a letter at Manafort’s behest to make that happen. And they brought up Craig’s agreement to have Skadden help Manafort and Ukraine with “Project Two” — another prosecution against Tymoshenko — while writing the report on the first Tymoshenko case. Craig eventually abandoned the idea.
Craig admitted “we did not identify Project Two” when speaking with the FARA unit.
Prosecutors asserted Craig was still looking for ways to make money with Manafort in Ukraine in 2013 “while you were writing letters back and forth to the FARA unit.”
“That’s right,” Manafort said.
The prosecution and defense will get a chance to make their final arguments Tuesday afternoon.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Sebastian Modak is visiting every destination on The New York Times's list of 52 Places to Go in 2019. He passed the halfway point of his journey in Zadar, Croatia. It was a good time to discuss the challenges and take stock of the thrills that have come with the assignment. "I don't fully understand how I'm still going," he said (from the Azores) in a Q. and A. on the website Reddit. An edited selection of that exchange follows.
Which experience sticks out in your memory the most?
There are many answers. But one that pops into the front of my mind, right off the bat, was in Uzbekistan. I put my trust in a stranger (and now a very good friend), and ended up in a village about an hour outside of Samarkand -- the only foreigner in a crowd of thousands. They were there to watch a game of kopkari, where about 200 dudes on horseback fight over the stuffed carcass of a goat. Not only did I feel insanely privileged to witness this tradition, but the kindness I saw in the people there who wanted to share it with me really blew me away. I can still taste the dust.
Can you suggest a good place for someone who has not traveled much before? And have you encountered many overcrowded places?
I'd say start with where you're from. That way you don't have to deal with language barriers or cultural mores you might not be as familiar with. I'm American and I loved my stops in Hunstville, Houston, Williamsburg and Columbus -- all places I had never been to.
Branching out from there, I'd say start with places that have good tourism infrastructure. (Western Europe is a pretty safe bet.) But -- and this is important -- don't be afraid to challenge yourself. Travel is all about trying something new, and if you only stick to what's somewhat familiar, in my opinion you're missing the point of getting off your couch in the first place.
Regarding overtourism: It is a real problem. I found myself in Europe smack in the middle of summer, and some of the crowds have been insane. But there are ways to get around it. Visit some of the most popular spots in the off-season; you'll be surprised how much fun you'll have and how much easier it will be to meet locals and get the feeling of a place. Also, maybe go to the popular spot (like I did in Zadar) but then ask around for tips on less trodden ground.
Chances are, just a quick jaunt away is somewhere that most of the tourists miss and that is just as spectacular as where the fleets of tour buses are heading.
How has this changed you as a traveler?
I think it's changed me in a lot of ways. Somewhat paradoxically, traveling at this frenetic pace has actually made me a more chilled-out traveler. I'm less concerned with ticking off the sights than I am letting a place really soak in. So if that means posting up at a bar or going for a walk instead of waiting in line for two hours, so be it.
It's also confirmed for me that there's something beautiful about every place in the world. (Obviously, I haven't been everywhere, but 26 in 26 weeks is a pretty good sample size.) And it means I've completely scrapped the idea of having a "bucket list."
What kind of photo equipment are you using?
I'm traveling with a Sony A9, with two lenses (a 24-70 and a fixed 55). Along with that, I've got a GoPro Hero 7 and two phones (one iPhone, one Android).
What has the journey taught you about people?
The most important thing I've learned is that people are, by and large, good. That more often than not, if you're lost, confused, in trouble, or lonely there's someone somewhere who wants to help. I owe so much to the kindness of strangers.
That, and that sometimes you really just have to go with the flow. When traveling, things are going to go wrong occasionally. Instead of drowning in a pit of stress and anger (something I have done in the past a fair number of times), sometimes it's O.K. to just throw your hands up and accept that there are forces beyond your control. Wait it out. Ask for help. Find the silver lining, which often is that you've been lucky enough to be able to get on a plane and see something new in the first place. Travel is about serendipity, and that applies to the good or the bad. Roll with it.

Texto completo: Our series “How I became a …” digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings starting an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage that turned into the booming fashion retailer Nasty Gal to writing New York Times bestseller #GIRLBOSS and founding the digital media brand and community Girlboss, Sophia Amoruso has been at the forefront of brand-building in the digital age.
USA TODAY caught up with Amoruso to talk about everything from learning tough lessons the hard way to being thirsty for knowledge.
Question: How did you get your start in the business world?
Sophia Amoruso: At 22, I started an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage, and it exploded. In a few years, we went from $250,000 to $1. 1 million to $6. 5 million to $30 million in revenue. I had never even worked in an office before, but I followed my nose and built a really big business. That brand spoke to women in a way beyond fashion – Nasty Gal was a community, and that’s the throughput with Girlboss. When a customer bought a motorcycle jacket, it was something that was a promise to herself to be just a little more bold in her life, and it was beyond a motorcycle jacket – it was something that made her feel more confident to go out into the world. That’s very much what Girlboss is – we’re doing that more directly with our professional network that we just launched – and her being able to see herself in a life that she wants and being able to take small steps forward to achieve that and see other people that are doing it is very much what I’ve done throughout my career.
In terms of Girlboss, it’s another thing that exploded. I wrote a book (“#GIRLBOSS) five years ago now, and the hashtag’s been used 17 million times on Instagram, the book’s sold half a million copies, Netflix put a show called “Girlboss” to 100 million homes, and it’s very much part of the zeitgeist. As a company, we’re two years in, and we have a podcast network, a yearly conference called Girlboss Rally, but what we’re really doing that that all ladders up to is building a digital professional network for ambitious women.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Amoruso: I usually take calls from home in the morning, and come in around 10. I have a lot of meetings, more than I would like, but there’s a lot to do. Those things can range from looking at creative to talking about our road map to having touch bases to recording a podcast. There’s a lot of shifting gears and a lot of variety in what I contribute to and spend time on (with) Girlboss. I have therapy twice a week, so part of that takes me across town, but I often work in that area after therapy and have meetings closer to West Hollywood. I go home at maybe 7, and for the most part I cook dinner for myself – I enjoy cooking – and I’ll often work from home for several hours after that, just catching up because there’s so little time to clean my inbox or do deeper thinking while I’m at the office.
Q: What’s your favorite thing about your job? Amoruso: Being able to learn. Our platform is in beta, but I’m beta, and I’ll always be beta. I get to learn things that I would never otherwise be able to and that I never even knew existed. Just learning, really every day – it’s such a privilege to be in a place where our business requires that.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Amoruso: Resourcefulness, grit and curiosity.
Q: How do you balance work, life and such a busy schedule? Amoruso: Unless I’m traveling, I don’t work on weekends. I make sure that if I need to work from home, I do. The whole team works from home on Fridays, which is really nice, and we’re able to work from anywhere. I rarely do business dinners – I go home almost every day and spend time cooking for myself, taking care of myself, and having some time alone until my boyfriend gets home, which is usually a little later than I get home. I make sure to do small self-care things, whether it’s doing yoga or something like getting my nails done – just stopping, taking care of my body, and feeling like I’m investing in feeling good and my body and who I am going out into the world. I also eat really healthfully: I don’t eat sugar, I don’t eat gluten, and that’s been really great because that 3 p. m. slump I get, I no longer get, and it’s been really great eating more healthfully.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Amoruso: The cover of Forbes was huge; publishing “#GIRLBOSS” was an unparalleled experience; opening our first store with Nasty Gal was so exciting, and founding Girlboss. Being able to focus on Girlboss full time three years after the book was published, knowing that there’s been a community waiting for us to build what we’re building today for girls that have read the book and have been inspired by the Girlboss ethos – that we have now built a place for her to go and connect with one another and advance her career professionally. That’s really, really, really rewarding.
Q: What has been one of the biggest tough lessons you’ve had to learn as an entrepreneur?
Amoruso: Holding executives accountable. That’s something I could have done a better job at at Nasty Gal. I hire people, and I trust them. The advice is to let smart people do their jobs, but at the same time, everybody needs that kind of guidance. I had hired executives who had careers longer than I had been alive when I was in my twenties, and I thought they’d show up and dive into business and just do what needed to be done, but I could’ve stayed closer to their work. That’s something I’ve learned the hard way.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps? Amoruso: Try a lot of things and find what resonates and what you’re good at. Especially when you’re young, you cannot fail. You have all the permission to jump around and try different things. Find smart people around you who have been there and done it. Seek out great advice, and stay curious. Use all of the resources you have at your disposal: read books, Google things, watch YouTube videos – whatever you need to answer the questions that you have. Find where you can gain that information and knowledge. A lot of that is on Girlboss – what we’re building with this social network is what I wish I’d had. To be able to connect with tens of thousands of women who have been there and understand what you’re going through more so than a Google search would is so, so powerful. There’s ways that you can fast-forward without having to learn those lessons the hard way by connecting with people who have done it.
Quick hits
• What’s your coffee order? Iced almond matcha right now from Intelligentsia here in Silver Lake.
• What’s your favorite book? I learned so much from “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products” by Nir Eyal, about building digital products that people love.
• What’s your favorite song of the moment? “Father and Son” by Cat Stevens
• Who has been one of your biggest mentors? My executive coach, who I’ve had for like seven years, Jeff Welch. He’s coached me through good times and bad times, and taught me a lot about leadership and has just been so committed and someone who’s always there. It’s rare that you have someone involved in your career trajectory for so long.
• What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever done? Hiked the Kalalau Trail in Kauai. I did 11 miles in a day, and it’s one of the most dangerous hikes in the world. There’s this area called Crawler’s Ledge, and you’re literally on all fours crawling across. I had 30 pounds on my back – we backpacked in and out – and it was terrifying. I cried.

Tune in vs. drop out; Many shows are worth catching in TV's new fall lineup, while others are iffy or pointless throwbacks

Texto completo: Get ready, couch potatoes.
This fall's TV season is more cross-your-fingers-and-hope-for-the-best than viewers would like - but the highs have a chance to soar.
Several anthologies, including Ryan Murphy's Netflix debut, may be the standouts of the season. But the schedule, packed with big names, is also littered with flimsy plots. Still, the beauty of TV is the surprises, not the predictable successes.
We're here to help, and have weeded through the lineup to help you figure out what's worth your time. Here are the new shows you should watch, give a try and avoid.
Watch
"Unbelievable" (premieres Sept. 13 on Netflix)
If it's not too traumatizing to watch, and for some it may be, this could be a defining story of the #MeToo movement. "Unbelievable" is a miniseries based on the ProPublica article about a teen (Kaitlyn Dever) accused of lying about her rape and the two female detectives (Merritt Wever and Toni Collette) who believe her.
"A Little Late with Lilly Singh" (premieres Sept. 16 at 1:35 a.m. on NBC)
While the small screen is saturated with talks shows, Lilly Singh is doing something special. The Indian-Canadian YouTube star with almost 15 million subscribers will become the only woman to host a late-night talk show on one of the four major networks when she takes over for Carson Daly. It's unlikely she'll change the genre in any noticeable way, at least not at first, but Singh's voice matters, maybe more than ever.
"Prodigal Son" (premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
In 2019 alone, Michael Sheen has played, to delightful results, a lawyer inspired by Roy Cohn on "The Good Fight" and a literal angel on "Good Omens," so the logical next step, of course, is a serial killer nicknamed The Surgeon. Everything about it is absurd: the serial killer's son (Tom Payne) who hunts serial killers and the ex-wife (Bellamy Young) who drowns her past in pills. Not to mention a truly bizarre and remarkable cast of surrounding characters.
"The Politician" (premieres Sept. 27 on Netflix)
Ryan Murphy, the co-creator behind "Glee," "American Horror Story" and much more, pulled out all the stops for his first show at Netflix, and that's saying a lot. In true Murphy fashion, he's compiled a who's who of Hollywood stars - including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Lange, Zoey Deutch, Lucy Boynton, Bette Midler, Judith Light, Dylan McDermott and January Jones - for a show about an entitled California high school student (Ben Platt) and his rise in politics. Murphy might be the busiest man on the West Coast these days, but he hasn't gotten it wrong in a long time.
"Modern Love" (premieres Oct. 18 on Amazon Video)
Anthologies are having a wildly successful run, thanks in large part to the aforementioned Murphy, which brings us to "Modern Love," based on The New York Times' weekly column. As is often the case with anthologies, the cast will carry it, and it's made up of Tina Fey, Anne Hathaway, John Slattery, Brandon Victor Dixon, Cristin Milioti, Andrew Scott, John Gallagher Jr. and pretty much everyone Murphy hasn't already cast.
"The Mandalorian" (premieres Tuesday, Nov. 12 on Disney+)
Sure, we may be culturally obligated to support all "Star Wars" content but there's no way Disney+ is launching an entire streaming service with a less-than-perfect series. Jon Favreau moves over from Marvel to write and produce the story of a Mandalorian gunfighter (Pedro Pascal) a few years before "Return of the Jedi."
"The Morning Show" (premieres this fall on Apple TV+)
It may be a little inside baseball, but there's an inherent interest in who decides what we see on TV during our morning Cheerios and how they decide it. Of course, it helps when Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell are the ones breaking the news. Early trailers for the comedy-drama less-than-subtly hint at a #MeToo ousting for Carell, but it's not quite clear if that's just a jumping-off point. Best-case scenario is that this is a less-pretentious version of "The Newsroom."
"The Gilded Age" (premieres in 2019 on HBO)
We don't even have a cast for "The Gilded Age" yet, let alone a trailer to go off of, but Julian Fellowes' "Downton Abbey" followup, about 1885 New York and the racial, financial and gender gaps that come with that time and that place, is full of promise. But can we get a trailer at some point please?
Try
"Emergence" (premieres Sept. 24 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Allison Tolman deserves better than the credit she gets for being such a great actress and she also probably deserves better than "Emergence," about a Long Island police chief who takes in a child after an accident of which she has no recollection. Like "Manifest" last season, this'll be all about how long the writers can drag out the mystery.
"Perfect Harmony" (premieres Sept. 26 at 8:30 p.m. on NBC)
The line between fun and cheesy is awfully thin and this Bradley Whitford/Anna Camp musical comedy series about a grumpy, Ivy League music professor and a small-town church choir could easily go either way. The songs will probably make or break it.
"Evil" (premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on CBS)
Robert and Michelle King are among the most underrated showrunners on TV (seriously, "The Good Wife" and "The Good Fight" are great, but please watch the canceled "BrainDead" too). Supernatural drama "Evil" revolves around a clinical psychologist (Katja Herbers), a priest-in-training (Mike Colter) and a contractor (Aasif Mandvi) investigating religious occurrences (miracles, demonic possessions) and could be fascinating. It also could just end up being a less fun version of "The X-Files."
"Almost Family" (premieres Oct. 2 at 9 p.m. on Fox)
Even if you're not a lawyer, you have to realize that using your own sperm at your fertility clinic crosses some ethical boundaries (it's also probably superillegal). But Leon Bechley (Timothy Hutton) somehow either didn't know or didn't care and now his daughter (Brittany Snow) is stuck with almost 100 new siblings, including Roxy (Emily Osment) and Edie (Megalyn Echikunwoke) in this drama.
Avoid
"Bob Hearts Abishola" (premieres Sept. 23 at 8:30 p.m. on CBS)
It's a little hard to believe that, in 2019, Chuck Lorre is putting out a sitcom based entirely on the premise that a mediocre middle-aged white man (Billy Gardell) could have a crush on an immigrant (Folake Olowofoyeku), but here we are. What about that exactly is funny? It's almost certainly not worth finding out. And hey, while you're here, please don't put emojis in show titles, like the actual heart shape that's officially used in the show's title. We are way too old for that.
"Stumptown" (premieres Sept. 25 at 10 p.m. on ABC)
Honestly, truly, how many tough private investigator shows do we need? It's like Mad Libs: (proper noun), a former (job title), moves to (city with a lot of rain) and becomes a private investigator so (he/she) can support (his/her) (family member). This time it's Cobie Smulders, Marine veteran, Portland, brother. Been there, been bored by that.
"Carol's Second Act" (premieres Sept. 26 at 9:30 p.m. on CBS)
Carol (Patricia Heaton) has fulfilled her duties as a wife and mother and now she gets to be a doctor like she always wanted because women can't actually be a wife, mother and doctor at the same time. So now we're left with a bunch of jokes about the aforementioned Carol being old and, well, that seems to be about it.
"Bless the Harts" (premieres Sept. 29 at 8:30 p.m. on Fox)
It's yet another animated show about a family being poor and white. The cast is great - Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, Jillian Bell and Ike Barinholtz are all lending their voices as series regulars and Mary Steenburgen is set to have a recurring role - but just go watch "King of the Hill" at this point. Or literally any of Fox's other animated sitcoms. They have enough.

The leader who took on society's ills as a business

Texto completo: The Business Roundtable's recent statement about redefining the purpose of a corporation turned out to be too difficult to read in one sitting.
Not that it was too long, at just 300 words or so. It was that boring.
If adopted, it's not clear what would even change. Today you are not supposed to rip off your customers. You are not supposed to abuse your workers or cheat your vendors. No one should ever leave a big mess in towns where they operate.
Had the roundtable said something about rolling back excessive C-suite pay, well, that would have at least been interesting. And also unthinkable, given that the group is made up of CEOs of some of the nation's most prestigious companies. If these executives are serious about rethinking purpose, they could do a little research into far more ambitious models, like stepping up to sell a product or service that takes on one of the country's pressing problems.
Hopefully they would learn that a version of that model once thrived here in Minnesota, created by a guy named Bill Norris. If this is an unfamiliar name, Norris helped get computer maker Control Data Corp. going in the late 1950s and then led it for the next three decades. He seemed to think economist Milton Friedman, who argued in a famous New York Times essay that making money for the corporation's owners was the sole proper purpose, was simply wrong.
There wasn't really a choice to make between making money or having a social impact. Why not do both?
The problems he saw and put CDC to work on -- huge disparities in
economic outcomes, small-business owners struggling on a playing field tilted against them, a vast need for cost-effective education, among them -- wouldn't get solved without the help of business. And they were moneymaking opportunities.
This wasn't his thinking in the early days of Control Data, long based in Bloomington. CDC was started to build the fastest computers largely by veterans, including Norris, of a groundbreaking supercomputer company in St. Paul called Engineering Research Associates.
Control Data became a big story in Minnesota almost from the beginning. It soon blossomed into one nationally as well.
After CDC sued International Business Machines Corp. in the 1960s over IBM's improper vaporware sales practices, Norris was on the cover of Businessweek as the only true rival to the then-dominant Big Blue.
The way CDC approached its problem of providing the "peripherals" its customers needed turned out to be an example of Norris's social-impact thinking. These are products like controllers and computer tape drives, and Norris asked why not put the peripherals plants in places where technology jobs were hard to come by? If the workers needed training, CDC could do that, too.
Small-business owners had a different problem, as Norris realized that without the money for Big Ticket computers they would have no way to get the productivity gains of new technology. His solution was data centers, a service business.
Some of these ideas didn't always sell that well inside the company. In oral histories of CDC found at the Charles Babbage Institute at the University of Minnesota, you can see that CDC's service business caused some of the old hands to leave CDC, fearing a lack of focus.
Eventually there were so many CDC initiatives there's no way to even list them all. Yet maybe nothing got more closely associated with the Norris social agenda than an education system he championed called PLATO.
Education looked to Norris like CDC's biggest opportunity. Millions of Americans needed cheaper, more readily available and easier ways to learn. And there was no practical way to solve a problem this big without computer technology.
This initiative got going decades before people talked of distance learning or online education. Once refined PLATO had lots of little teaching functions. If a kid on PLATO looked at 3 + 2 = ___ and answered "6," the machine asked if maybe the student hadn't mistakenly multiplied.
PLATO was one tool to let kids catch up to their peers in subjects like math. Prison systems also used it to help inmates get a GED -- and a better shot at a decent job someday.
As described in an oral history at the Babbage Institute with former CDC manager Molly Lou Reko, Norris didn't think anybody should be thought of as "learning disabled." Some people just needed more time to learn than others; with PLATO they got as much as they needed.
PLATO was never the bottomless money pit it eventually became infamous as, as explained by former Control Data CEO Robert Price in interviews with the Babbage Institute's former director, Thomas Misa.
Norris contributed to his own PR problem, once telling a Wall Street audience about all the investment in this education technology, and Price remembered $200 million. Yet Norris had meant all government and university funding, too.
Norris eventually found out something that could have been anticipated. The same executive could be hailed as a visionary when the stock was appreciating and sales were growing and then mocked as hopelessly misguided when the stock price and sales trends went the other way.
The old CDC barely got out of the 1980s alive, and "even today, it is by no means clear what really went wrong," Misa wrote in his excellent 2013 history of Minnesota's computer industry.
In looking back at this period, though, it looks like CDC had too many things going on and some poor execution, too, rather than Norris's notion of social impact being wrongheaded from the start.
Norris was clearly right, for instance, that a lot of money gets spent on education and that it was going to be a moneymaking opportunity for a long time. Norris' experience at CDC allowed him to tell a business audience in 1979 that social programs really can deliver good financial results.
As he was winding up his talk, he said he hoped he had made a convincing case for business to go after the biggest problems we have.
"Because there are no other answers," he continued. "All of the obvious and easy approaches have been tried and found wanting."

Watch out, investors: Statistics can lie. Your 401(k) will thank you seeing the truth

Texto completo: “There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics. ”
Mark Twain popularized that quote over a century ago. It couldn’t be more true now.
Pundits constantly bombard investors with wild economic and stock market claims backed with charts and data. Much of it is bunk. But it isn’t hard to see through it if you're armed with a few simple tricks.
Those tricks come from one of my all-time favorite books: Darrell Huff’s 1954 classic, How to Lie With Statistics. It’s humorous, illustrated and non-academic—a great guide about how people torture data to force them to fit their argument. Here are its five most useful nuggets.
1. Beware stats from surveys
Surveys are only as good as their representativeness. But most have baked-in biases and aren’t truly representative. Political polls, wrong in so many recent elections, prove this. So do opinion surveys of all stripes. As Huff writes: “No conclusion that ‘sixty-seven percent of the American people are against’ something should be read without the lingering question, sixty-seven percent of which American people?”
2. Don’t take “averages” at face value
According to the Social Security Administration, average U. S. annual wages in 2017 were both $48,251. 57 and $31,561. 49. How? Technically there are different kinds of averages. The higher figure is the arithmetic mean. The lower is the median — the number in the middle, with half of wages higher and half lower. Both are “right,” but the mean average often gets skewed by outliers. You can’t assess an average until you know what kind it is and what skew it may hide. Keep this in mind when digesting climate stats. As Huff showed, Oklahoma City’s average temperature from 1890 – 1952 was a cool 60. 2 degrees—but temperatures in that window ranged from -17 to 113.
3. Consider “axis” fraud
Usually, in economic graphs, the horizontal line or “axis” shows dates and the vertical axis shows quantity or size. It’s easy to make anything look way wilder than reality simply by stretching the vertical axis scale or skipping a whole chunk of it. In 2014 someone did this with the Dow to make that year’s market movement look just like the run-up to the 1929 crash. It went viral—scaring many. Properly graphed, the two periods looked nothing alike. Blatant fear-mongering, lying with charts.
What could the next recession feel like?: Stories from past downturns are a guide
AI at work:: Machines are training human workers to be more compassionate
4. Know your profits.
Does an article about corporate profits report earnings per share? Or does it talk about gross operating profit margins? Is it discussing return on assets? Or on equity? As Huff explained, “You can, for instance, express exactly the same fact by calling it a one percent return on sales, a fifteen percent return on investment, a ten-million dollar profit, an increase in profits of forty percent (compared with 1935-39 average), or a decrease of sixty percent from last year. ” Writers and companies will often pick the one that best suits their angle.
5. No correlation without causation
As Huff explained, once upon a time, a study showed non-smokers got better college grades than smokers. But did not smoking help students get better grades? Or did bad grades drive more people to smoke? Is it a mere coincidence? Tyler Vigen’s hilarious website, Spurious Correlations, shows how easy it is to draw false conclusions between two totally unconnected things. Did you know annual per-capita cheese consumption correlates with the number of people who died from tangled bedsheets? Or that U. S. chicken consumption correlates with oil imports? People pull similar stunts with market data every day. That’s where we get seasonal myths.
For more, get the book.
It’s cheap and a breezy 144 pages. Your 401(k) will thank you.

The language of Trump and why it matters

Texto completo: For a while, The New York Times kept a running list of the people and countries whom Donald J. Trump has insulted on Twitter since he declared his candidacy for president.
The Times isn't updating the list nearly as often as when they first published it. There are simply too many to keep up with, I imagine.
But here are just a few of his droppings: Trump recently suggested four Democratic Congresswomen - all women of color - are "racist" and "not very smart." He also suggested they "go back" to where they came from - though only one of the women was born outside this country. He said Jews who vote for Democratic candidates are "disloyal." He called Mexicans "rapists." He called a former African American employee a "dog." Conservative columnist Bill Kristol is "dopey." CNN anchor Don Lemon is "the dumbest man on television." Founder and chief executive of Amazon Jeff Bezos is "Jeff Bozo." And we'll always have "Crooked Hillary."
Sadly, Trump tends to double down when confronted about his racism and misogyny, and this is problematic to the extreme. This is the president of the United States. Love him, hate him, be indifferent. His words have weight. He's setting an example. Even children know this.
Lynne Tirrell has always been interested in the power of speech, and how speech shapes social reality. Her University of Pittsburgh dissertation for her doctorate in philosophy looked at metaphor. She's worked at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of Massachusetts, Boston, and her work in metaphors moved into the study of hate speech. She came to UConn, she said, because of its strong philosophy faculty and the work done by the university's Human Rights Institute, with which she is affiliated.
It is Tirrell's work on hate speech for which she is best known. She became interested in the role of speech in heinous crimes after studying the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where between 800,000 and a million Tutsi people were killed in just 100 days by Hutu extremists.
Tirrell is best known for her 2012 paper, "Genocidal Language Games," in which she examined how what we'd call hate speech opened the door for that genocide. A steady diet of derogatory language can be, according to her paper, "part and parcel" of genocide, and not just the lead-in to it.
Prior to the bloodshed, Rwandan political leaders such as Léon Mugesera repeatedly called the Tutsi minority "invaders." He also said the Tutsi should "go back" to where they came from.
Does this sound familiar? It should.
Tirrell recently wrote an op-ed for The Guardian newspaper where she drew a thick line between President Trump's penchant for hate speech and the increase in hate crimes around the country.
Did Trump drive that car into Heather Heyer, the 32-year old woman killed at a "Unite the Right" rally in 2017 Charlottesville? No. The car was driven by a 21-year-old recently found guilty of murder, whose teachers said he showed a fascination for Nazism and Hitler.
But Trump as good as bought the gas and handed the Nazi a map.
And here are more receipts: A recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University San Bernardino said that hate crimes against members of the LGBTQ community, Jews and people of color rose by 9% in major U.S. cities last year. The FBI's 2017 Universal Crime Report said that hate crimes increased 17% over 2016, the year Trump took office. Researchers call this the "Trump effect." A Texas study released in March showed that in counties where Trump held a rally, there was a 226% increase in hate-motivated incidents.
The Human Rights Campaign has cited an increase in youth bullying during and since the 2016 campaign after interviewing 50,000 youths between 13 and 18, 79% of whom said they saw more frequent bullying since the start of Trump's campaign.
As Tirrell wrote for The Guardian, our words don't act alone. They shape our social hierarchy. They shape future action.
Trump shows no sign of cleaning up his act. If Trump's colleagues won't stand against the hateful rhetoric, then the rest of us must.

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger.
In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+.
Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV show in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not yet announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show."
And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. Series such as ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) are also coming back for one last season.
To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone' Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction, and uses its animation to beautifully and render eerily realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music' PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; check local listings)
Because aKen Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated director to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise genre is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown' ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ("The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn' CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician' Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high-school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life' Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself' Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this new comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip-mall spa, and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love' Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series about love. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident, or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical the Musical the Series' Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and is genuinely funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials' HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life, in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: pen your theater program this fall, you may notice some new faces have replaced iconic ones: The old guard of Atlanta theater is stepping aside, making space for new leaders. At True Colors Theatre, Jamil Jude takes over for founding artistic director Kenny Leon. At Theatrical Outfit, Tom Key is serving out his final season. On these and other stages, you'll witness stories about individuals and communities seeking to make sense of their place in a changing world.
| "Our Town"/ "The Laramie Project." When "The Laramie Project" appeared in 2000, New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley described the play -- about the murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard and the effect of the hate crime on the town of Laramie, Wyoming -- as a modern-day "Our Town." Said Brantley: "'The Laramie Project' is 'Our Town' with a question mark, as in, 'Could this be our town? It can't happen here,' followed immediately by 'And yet it has.'" For Key's final season, Theatrical Outfit stages both plays in rotating repertory--with a single acting company for Grover's Corners and Laramie, and some surprising casting choices. The estimable Atlanta actress Mary Lynn Owen, for instance, will portray "Laramie" playwright Moises Kaufman and the stage manager of "Our Town," traditionally a male role. Theatrical Outfit. Aug. 27-Sept. 29. $15-$51. 84 Luckie St.NW, Atlanta. 678-528-1500, theatricaloutfit.org
| "Becoming Nancy." The Alliance Theatre stages the world premiere of yet another musical with an eye on Broadway. This time, it's 1979 and David Starr, a South London 12th-grader who loves Blondie and Kate Bush, is cast as Nancy in his school musical "Oliver!" The Alliance spectacle, directed and choreographed by Broadway's Jerry Mitchell ( "Kinky Boots," "La Cage Aux Folles"), is a coming-of-age, coming-out tale that looks at how David's family, friends and community react to the shocker. Alliance Theatre. Sept. 6-Oct. 6. $25-$85. 1280 Peachtree St.NE, Atlanta. 404-733-5000, alliancetheatre.org
| "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." In the sultry Tennessee Williams barn burner, the sexual tension between an aging football hero and his tempestuous wife spills over into a birthday celebration for a Mississippi patriarch. Georgia Ensemble's production stars Joe Sykes and Kate Donadio MacQueen as the warring Brick and Maggie, and Atlanta playwright Topher Payne makes a rare stage appearance as Brick's older brother, who is too preoccupied with his inheritance to control his "no-neck monsters." Georgia Ensemble Theatre. Sept. 12-29. $29-$55. 950 Forrest St., Roswell. 770-641-1260, get.org
| "Skintight." The bristling new comedy by Joshua Harmon( "Bad Jews," "Significant Other") feels custom-tailored for a culture preoccupied with youth, beauty and sex. A tightly wound L.A. lawyer (Wendy Melkonian) arrives in Manhattan for the 70th birthday of her fashion-mogul father (shades of Calvin Klein). But will her heart still belong to daddy when she discovers him living with a 20-year-old gay porn star? Actor's Express. Sept. 18-Oct. 13. $20-$50. 887 W. Marietta St.NW, Atlanta. 404-607-7469. actors-express.com
| "Paradise Blue." Life after Leon begins with Jude directing the 1949 episode of Dominque Morriseau's Detroit trilogy. True Colors previously produced the 2018 MacArthur Foundation genius-grant recipient's "Detroit '67" and "Skeleton Crew." In "Paradise Blue," the mayor of Motor City is trying to move African Americans out of Detroit's Black Bottom neighborhood. What does this mean for trumpet player Blue and his family's thriving jazz club? True Colors Theatre. Sept. 24-Oct. 20. $20-$50. Southwest Arts Center, 915 New Hope Road, Atlanta. 888-479-6300, truecolorstheatre.org

What will we do in Heaven?

Texto completo: Preparing dinner was unusually difficult for me this evening. I don't especially like to cook, and it seems I have more than my share of bad days in the kitchen. I burn my fingers, make unnecessary messes, overcook things and have trouble getting everything ready at the same time. My mother said I inherited this problem from my paternal grandmother.
When it was finally time to sit down and eat, I was feeling a little irritable and said to Mr. H., "When I get to Heaven, I hope they don't put me on kitchen duty. He laughed, and said, "I don't think we'll be needing food in Heaven, so you shouldn't have to worry.
"That's good! I answered. "That means no grocery shopping either! I hope I get to do something I love.
"I'm sure each person will be allowed to do the things he or she loves, he said, going along with my foolishness.
"That's wonderful, I said, "I love to read, but if I know everything after I die, there won't be any reason to read, will there? And how will I write the stories I love to write?
Smiling, Mr. H. said, "Uh-oh! That could be a problem. There will be no computers in Heaven.
"Hmmmm ... how will people get along without computers?
He shrugged.
Thinking a minute, I said, "I know! I love music. I'll just sit around in Heaven all day listening to music. What could be better than that? I was pleased with myself until it struck me ...
"But what will you do? I said.
In his easy way, Mr. H. smiled and said, "Oh, I don't know. I'm certain there'll be something for me to do.
And then I remembered something this man loves - little babies. Tiny infants just home from the hospital. He held and cuddled and rocked our five, and then he did the same when our grandchildren came along. He never tired of it.
"I've got it! I told him. "Rocking sweet little babies would be the perfect job for you throughout eternity!
He smiled, and my frivolous dinner conversation was over, leaving me in a much better mood.
Later, when I was alone and in a more serious frame of mind, I thought about that conversation and wondered aloud, "What will we do in Heaven?
The thought aroused my curiosity and led me to do some research. Here's what I found:
American Christian author and New York Times bestselling author, Randy Alcorn, says it best in one of his more than 60 books. It's entitled "Heaven.
"In Heaven, he begins, "God's presence will be all pervasive and anyone who has approached God's presence knows the joy of such an encounter - the hint of glory and beauty beyond human comprehension. Revelation 21:23 - The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
The idea of working in Heaven is foreign to many people. Yet Scripture clearly teaches it. When God created Adam, he "took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it (Genesis 2:15). Work was part of the original Eden. It was part of a perfect human life.
God Himself is a worker. He didn't create the world and then retire. Jesus said, "My Father is always at His work to this very day, and I, too, am working (John 5:17). Jesus found great satisfaction in His work. "My food,' Jesus said, is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work' (John 4:34).
We'll also have work to do, satisfying and enriching work that we can't wait to get back to, work that'll never be drudgery. God is the primary worker, and as His image-bearers, we're made to work. We create, accomplish, set goals and fulfill them - to God's glory.
Sadly though, even among Christians, it's a prevalent myth that Heaven will be boring.
Sometimes we can't envision anything beyond strumming a harp and polishing streets of gold. Satan's most basic strategy, the same one he employed with Adam and Eve, is to make us believe that sin brings fulfillment. However, in reality, sin robs us of fulfillment. Sin's emptiness inevitably leads to boredom.
In contrast, everything good, enjoyable, refreshing, fascinating and interesting is derived from God. God promises that we'll laugh, rejoice and experience endless pleasures in Heaven. To be in His presence will be the very opposite of boredom.
Psalm 16:11: "You reveal the path of life to me; in Your presence is abundant joy; in Your right hand are eternal pleasures.

Hurricane Dorian updates: Path of storm shifts as Florida sees signs of hope

Texto completo: Hurricane Dorian intensified to a Category 4 storm late on Friday as it swirled toward the United States, and forecasters on Saturday were projecting a sharp swerve north along Florida’s eastern coast before it comes ashore. Dorian could now make landfall in Georgia or the Carolinas later next week after losing some of its strength.
It was good news for Floridians, who could now be spared a direct hit. But the powerful storm is still dangerous, and much of the state remains in the area that forecasters believe could be assailed by heavy winds, rain and storm surge.
Dorian was about 415 miles east of West Palm Beach, Florida, late Saturday morning, steadily intensifying while sustaining winds near 150 mph and moving west near 8 mph.
For those watching as the storm cuts a wobbly path through the Atlantic, it does not help that this system has been especially unpredictable and has such a wide possible route ahead, or what meteorologists call the “cone of uncertainty.” Forecasters have had to adjust both when and where Dorian will slam into the mainland U.S. several times in the past few days, baffling officials and residents trying to make preparations.
In the Bahamas, residents of the archipelago’s northwestern islands braced for a direct hit from Dorian as the government ordered the evacuation of low-lying areas.
Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands were expected to take the brunt of the storm Sunday. The National Hurricane Center warned that because the storm’s movement had slowed, the area should prepare for “a prolonged period of life-threatening storm surge and devastating hurricane force winds.”
The area lying in Dorian’s path is not a major center for tourism, although several cruise ships diverted their routes to avoid the storm.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida welcomed Dorian’s eastward shift but warned that the forecast remains uncertain.
“If it bumps just a little west, then you’re looking at really, really significant impacts,” he said Saturday morning. He asked residents to heed local orders for mandatory evacuations, which are in place along some coastal communities.
“You’re still looking at really significant storm surge in the east coast of Florida,” he said. “You’re looking at major flooding events in different parts of the state.”

Rich Lowry: Leftist media outlets should stop whining

Texto completo: The New York Times, an organization devoted to gathering and publishing information, doesn’t want people to gather or publish information inconvenient to it.
A group of Trump-supporting operatives has been finding and archiving old social media postings of Times employees and other journalists for use in the ongoing brawl between the president and the press.
There’s no indication that this is dumpster diving rather than an effort to scour readily available sources for stupid, embarrassing or offensive things that journalists have said publicly under their own power.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
The Times broke the news of the campaign in an alarmed-sounding report. It related that “the material publicized so far, while in some cases stripped of context or presented in misleading ways, has proved authentic, and much of it has been professionally harmful to its targets.”
It’s not clear what makes this different from what happens in our public life … every … single … day. Headhunting based on past offenses, real and imagined, is the norm, indeed one of the left’s favored forms of ideological combat.
Nonetheless, the press and its progressive allies act as though the First Amendment is being endangered if journalists apologize for past things they have written or — depending on the decisions of their own organizations — get cashiered for them.
“The goal of this campaign is clearly to intimidate journalists from doing their job,” thundered Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, “which includes serving as a check on power and exposing wrongdoing when it occurs. The Times will not be intimidated or silenced.”
A spokesman for CNN went further, saying that when government officials, “and those working on their behalf, threaten and retaliate against reporters as a means of suppression, it’s a clear abandonment of democracy for something very dangerous.”
The MSNBC host Joy Reid tweeted (then deleted), “Welcome to the age of digital brownshirtism.”
This is the usual hysteria yoked to the usual foggy thinking. The First Amendment is an important protection of press freedom. Yet nothing in it protects members of the press from criticism, let alone criticism over things they have written. Such criticisms are exercises of free speech in response to other exercises of free speech — i.e., public debate.
If the Times and others don’t like the weaponization of foolhardy and untoward social media postings, they can start pushing back against it across the board.
The left-wing organization Media Matters for America exists to publicize (allegedly) controversial statements by conservative media figures toward the end of getting them fired or ushered off the air. If recirculating the past tweets of employees of liberal news organizations is undemocratic, why isn’t the work of Media Matters also dangerously authoritarian?
The Times may say that it won’t be “intimidated” by pressure over past postings, but it has readily surrendered to such pressure from the left. The paper pulled the plug on its hiring of tech writer Quinn Norton last year when it emerged that she had tweeted offensive terms about gays and blacks, albeit sardonically.
The hounding of conservatives isn’t considered beyond the pale; it’s considered sport. Much of the left would be rendered practically mute if it weren’t braying for people to be fired.
When The Atlantic had the temerity to hire my colleague Kevin Williamson, a fearless and brilliant libertarian controversialist, seemingly every liberal outlet in the country joined in the pile-on. Williamson’s hiring was swiftly revoked, with none of his critics detecting a threat to democracy in the episode. (Williamson has written a keen book about his experience, “The Smallest Minority: Independent Thinking in the Age of the Mob Politics”).
I think it’s a bad idea for either side to rummage through old social media postings and writings looking for firing offenses. It’s an inherently punitive project, and often an unfair one (no one is the sum of their tweets). But the rules of this game were established by the left long ago. It should either change them — or stop whining.

The truth about James Comey

Texto completo: On Jan. 28, 2017, a day after having dinner with President Trump at the White House, James Comey wrote a memo recording his recollection of the evening and the conversation.
“I felt comfortable throughout,” he wrote, “although never relaxed, given the focus the conversation required.”
Comey noted that the president had asked him, “So what do you want to do?” in the context of a discussion of whether the then-FBI director would stay in that job or move on.
“I responded by saying that he could fire me any time he wished, but that I wanted to stay,” Comey wrote. “I added that I was ‘reliable’ in one way but not in the way political people sometimes use the term. I explained that he could count on me to always tell him the truth. I said I don’t do sneaky things, I don’t leak, I don’t do weasel moves.”
Then the president asked “whether the FBI leaks.” Comey wrote that he told Trump the whole government leaks like crazy, and “he replied that he needed loyalty and expected loyalty.”
If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because it was one of the leaks that was splashed all over newspaper front pages and TV news shows from Comey’s memos of his conversations with Trump, which he had secretly stored in his personal safe at his home and retrieved after the FBI locked him out of his office a few months later, on the day the president fired him.
It might have saved the country a lot of time and stress if Comey had leaked the quotation that the president “could fire me any time he wished.” But that might have inhibited calls for an investigation into potential obstruction of justice.
That’s not what Comey wanted. He wanted a special counsel to investigate the president.
According to the new report from the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General, Comey improperly stashed private copies of four of seven memos he wrote to document his official meetings with Trump. One of them memorialized the conversation in a one-on-one meeting on February 14, 2017, in which Trump had said he hoped Comey could “see [his] way clear … to letting [Michael] Flynn go.”
Days after he was fired on May 9, 2017, Comey texted photos of “Memo 4” to his personal attorney and friend, Daniel Richman, with specific instructions to share the contents, but not the document, with a New York Times reporter.
The newspaper ran the story the same day under the headline, “Comey memo says Trump asked him to end Flynn investigation.” It related all the details that Comey had noted about the Oval Office meeting, including the notation about “letting Flynn go.”
The inspector general’s report says Comey did not mark Memo 4 as classified, even though Flynn was the subject of a non-public FBI investigation at the time. Instead, he gave one copy to his chief of staff to keep at the FBI and he secretly kept a copy in his personal safe at home.
We didn’t need the IG report to know why Comey arranged the leak. He told us himself, in testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he did it to “prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” He said he was concerned that Trump might destroy tapes of their conversations: “My judgment was, I need to get that out into the public square. I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.”
The inspector general thought that explanation was unacceptable. “Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a special counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure,” the IG wrote. “What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
What was the outcome that Comey personally desired? Was it really the appointment of a special counsel in order to force the preservation of supposed tapes in the White House? Or did he reveal his true goal with his own words?
In the same testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June 2017, Comey was asked by Sen. John Cornyn about the Hillary Clinton email investigation and former President Bill Clinton’s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just as the investigation was wrapping up.
“After former President Clinton met on the plane with the attorney general, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel and decided that would be an unfair thing to do because I knew there was no case there,” Comey testified, speaking of the Clinton email investigation. “And calling for the appointment of a special counsel would be brutally unfair because it would send the message, ‘Uh-huh, there’s something here.’ ”
Cornyn asked, “If a special counsel had been appointed, they could have made that determination there was nothing there and declined to pursue it, right?”
“Sure,” Comey answered, “but it would have been many months later or a year later.”
If that isn’t enough to prove that Comey intended and knowingly acted to smear the president with an endless investigation based on no wrongdoing, consider Comey’s notes from the Jan. 27 dinner meeting, the one in which he said he doesn’t do sneaky things, doesn’t leak, doesn’t do weasel moves.
Comey wrote that Trump said the salacious story about prostitutes in a Russian hotel was “a complete fabrication and ‘fake news,’” and the president “said he thought maybe he should ask me to investigate the whole thing to prove it was a lie.”
“I replied that it was up to him,” Comey wrote, “but I wouldn’t want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued. I also said that it is very difficult to disprove a lie.”
It sure is. It’s even more difficult when the liar hides behind the fine reputation of federal law enforcement agents, people who did their greatest work for the country on the day they locked James Comey out of the building.

Texto completo: Can't see the stars in the night sky? You're not alone. A recent New York Times editorial by Kelsey Johnson, a professor of astronomy at the University of Virginia, laments the loss of the stars:
"...with populations swelling and demands for lighting increasing, the global amount of artificial light at night has been growing by at least 2 percent per year. At this rate the amount of light pollution originating from Earth-based sources alone will double in less than 50 years."
Artificial lighting is also a contributor to health issues, including cancer and sleep disorders.
But Johnson writes that "According to the International Dark Sky Association, thousands of cities have adopted "lighting ordinances" that help to limit light pollution."
Tallahassee has been replacing older street lights with more efficient and sky friendly LED lights that direct light down to the street – not up into the sky.
You can help — don't place outside lights so they point up into the sky.
Morning sky: "Move along — nothing to see here folks." Both Mercury and Mars are on the far side of the Sun: Superior conjunction.
Evening sky: Jupiter continues to dominate the evening sky. Look for the gas giant west of south about half way up from the horizon at sunset.
By the end of September Jupiter will be setting around 10 p.m. Saturn sits about directly south as the Sun sets. The yellowish "star" is just above and to the left of the handle of the Sagittarius' "Teapot."
This is a good time to watch the two largest planets in our solar system. Check out TAS' events calendar for public viewings.

Valerie Harper's death reminded me of my rant about 'Rhoda' and the great response I got

Texto completo: It was 1975 and I was upset. Rhoda had just gotten married and suddenly her career seemed to have disappeared. It wasn’t as if being a free-lance window dresser was an inflexible, 24-7 job, and she didn’t even have any children to keep her busy at home. And yet she was getting subsumed into her marriage to Joe.
It’s true that Rhoda was a fictional character in a TV sitcom, but that made no difference to me. In fact it made it worse in a way: Here was a story that could be told any way the writers wanted, and my hopes for a feminist heroine were fading.
What happened next reveals so much about a time many women today can’t even fathom: I typed an earnest, frustrated letter to the "Rhoda" show and received an earnest, frustrated reply from an "executive script consultant" named Charlotte Brown. Also typewritten.
Rhoda's career was 'backsliding'
All this resurfaced like a message in a bottle with the death of Valerie Harper, the star of "Rhoda. " “Thank you so much for your sincere concern regarding RHODA,” Brown wrote. “I’m very sorry that we’ve been ‘depressing’ you with Rhoda’s ‘typical’ behavior. Yes, she has done some laundry, yes, she has done some cooking, but we have tried like hell to keep her out of the kitchen…”
The letter goes on to explain the responsibility the show felt to define Rhoda’s new marriage as two people “who love each other but who refuse to lose their individual identities in marriage. ” She went on, “Rest assured, Jill. We are filming a show next week … and it concerns just the situation you mention in your letter. ” That is, Rhoda’s concern about “backsliding” in her career.
“I think this will answer your objection about any ‘atrophy of the intellect’ or ‘alienation from people in general,’” Brown said, and thanked me for watching. I don’t have my own letter, but this and other sections of Brown’s response make my mood and tone pretty clear: Young, annoyed, fiercely feminist and extremely disappointed.
The 1970s squad wimps out
Why was I so put out? Twitter user Freddie Johnson got at part of it when he said of a photo of Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman, “In 1974, this was The Squad. ” And The Squad, in my view, was wimping out.
March of women's progress: #MeToo and inclusion riders are great. But should I worry about my son?
Strange but true, young and no-so-young women, it was not always the norm for married women to work. And when they did, before changes over “the last several decades,” the Labor Department noted in 2011, “Women's work outside of home and marriage was restricted to a handful of occupations such as domestic service, factory work, farm work, and teaching. ” It wasn’t until the very late 1960s that newspapers like the New York Times and Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stopped running separate male and female “help wanted” ads.
So it was unusual in the 1970s for women to work in a TV newsroom (like Mary Tyler Moore’s Mary Richards) or dressing windows (like Harper’s Rhoda). And it was especially revolutionary to see women like this on television. You need only look at the fare from the 1960s (with the possible exception of "Get Smart") to see what a departure these shows represented. In Moore’s role as a housewife that decade on "The Dick Van Dyke Show," one of her revolutionary contributions apparently was wearing Capri pants and flats at a time when most housewives still wore dresses and heels. At least on TV.
Letter writer was a feminist pioneer
Charlotte Brown, it turns out, was a full-fledged member of the 1970s Squad. “Virtually every series that I was hired to write on, I was the first woman the producer had ever hired,” she said in a WHOA! Network interview posted on YouTube, and the first woman in writer’s rooms “that wasn’t taking dictation or a lunch order. ” Though she never checked it out, she said, "when I started producing Rhoda, I was supposedly the first woman writer-producer of a multi-camera comedy. ”
Oscar nominee Regina King: My commitment to gender equality must only be the beginning
Brown is now 75 and no doubt has long forgotten the letter she wrote to an anxious young woman trying to escape a dead-end job and break into political journalism, another field that was not exactly overrun with women in 1975.
But America was on the cusp of a transformational era in the lives of women. Feminists like Brown and me and Valerie Harper were fortunate to be around at that moment, pushing for change and benefiting from the opportunities we helped create.

A call for attitudes consistent with goals

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Recently I had a conversation with my barber. It began when I asked her which channel was broadcasting the news I heard coming from the TV behind me on the wall out of my view. I expressed my theory that the style of certain networks was to hype the news with raised voices, great enthusiasm and extreme adjectives projecting their opinions, whether the subject was a local tragedy or a description of an international incident.
Based upon my theory, I speculated that the program we were hearing was from one of two networks.
My barber acknowledged that I was correct. However, she didn't stop there. With her sharp scissors rapidly clicking dangerously near my ear she confessed her anxiety and distress over the mean-spiritedness she encounters daily in the media. She did not know where to turn. “In fact,” she said, “I can't listen to or watch the news any more. It freaks me out. I can't get the terrible way people treat each other out of my head.”
She continued, expressing dismay over President Donald Trump's mean-spirited tweets and speeches. “No American president should mix truth with lies and say the contemptuous things he does about people. It is not presidential. He's done some good things for our country, but I can't support his attitude.”
Now in her mid-twenties she has not yet voted in an election. She felt she had not been informed enough to make a reasoned decision. However, seeking to relieve her present anxiety, she was ready to vote in the next election. “But first,” she said, “I need to learn how the government works, how elections are conducted and how to get to know the candidates for president.”
I write to tell my barber there are many others who are stressed out over the trends toward labeling, fear of others, racism, homophobia and white male privilege. You are not alone. There are people speaking out and advocating for a better way.
I write to support my friend Robert Azzi, photo journalist, who is both angry and sad, crying out on the Opinion page of the Monitor, “What have we become? What is this world we inhabit? . . . Racism is not a policy or a political position. It's a moral failure on the part of those who believe some people are more worthy, more human, than others, who believe people of color must be grateful for the noblesse oblige that tolerates their presence.”
I write to thank the U.S. House of Representatives for passing H.Res.486 – condemning President Trump's racist comments directed at members of Congress.
The resolution says, in part, Congress “strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the president like immigrants, should ‘go back' to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as ‘invaders,' and by saying that members of Congress who are immigrants (or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America.”
I write to support all of those who are embarrassed and dismayed by the appalling attitude of the president toward people who disagree with him. Some have chosen to disregard the president's temperament in order to preserve a political agenda that they think will benefit the country. They live by the old chestnut, “The end justifies the means.” Literature is filled with scenarios of individuals tempted to give a pass to immorality, twisted ethics or sacrifice of a neighbor in order to accomplish something perceived to be of benefit to the greater good. It is a deception and a trap that corrupts a person's integrity, consistency and well-being. In fact, one of the fears Trump raises among many people is that his means will be the end goal: a country and society of exclusion, racism, white privilege, abusive power and an erosion of democracy.
Faithful relationships, truth-telling and a democratic society depend upon compatibility between means and goals. Therefore, it makes sense to look for consistency among the attitudes, methods and the goals espoused by politicians and candidates. I would suggest to my barber that this approach will serve her well as a start in her preparation to vote in the 2020 elections.
Finally, I write to say we have companions in the struggle for a kinder more empathetic society.
David Brooks, an op-ed columnist for the New York Times, said recently on NPR that he was sure that the majority of Americans do not support the mean-spirited language and attitudes of the people at the Trump North Carolina rally who shouted “send them back.” This majority only has to speak out.

MAILBAG; A pox on both their beds

Texto completo: The latest trivial battle between left and right pits a liberal college professor against a well-known conservative columnist at the New York Times. If you guessed that most of our letters would side with the professor, you'd be wrong.
I'm talking about the dustup on Twitter between the New York Times' Bret Stephens and George Washington University professor David Karpf, who called Stephens a "bedbug" on Twitter. Stephens responded with an email to Karpf and his boss; Karpf then wrote an op-ed article in the L.A. Times accusing the columnist of abusing his power.
Karpf did not get much sympathy from our letter writers.

-- Paul Thornton, letters editor
Anne Chomyn of Altadena does not like name-calling:
Karpf took umbrage at the fact that Stephens copied the college provost on an email inviting Karpf to call him a bedbug to his face. Karpf accused Stephens of unfairly wielding his power as a columnist for the New York Times to make trouble for Karpf.
Well, it turns out this is working out well for the professor, who has since written an op-ed article for the L.A. Times, had an essay published in Esquire, been interviewed by Slate and National Public Radio, and been the focus of multiple articles online.
Karpf glosses over the insult, calling it a "tame joke."
It was name-calling, the worst form of argument, and a type of tweet that should be beneath a digital media expert.
Linda Bradshaw Carpenter of Los Angeles didn't want to read about this spat in the L.A. Times:
Why would The Times find it relevant to publish anything about some tiff between two guys that I am sure most of us readers couldn't care less about? Their email and Twitter feud should have vanished quickly, but you had to publish something on it.
There really must not be any positive news or accomplishments of consequence right now for this to get your attention. The world is a really big place; get out of your own way and go find more positive things to write about.
Calabasas resident Gilbert Skoop is sympathetic to Stephens:
I find Karpf's op-ed article to be self-serving hogwash.
I too am not a fan of Stephens, going back to his days at the Wall Street Journal, but in this instance I find him more credible than Karpf. His email to him was intended to counter the stupid invective posted frequently on Twitter by people like Karpf, who expect to be protected by something like anonymity.
Stephens invited Karpf to his home, to meet his family and then to call him a bedbug to his face. Obviously, this was something Karpf could not do. It's far easier to insult by Twitter than face to face.
Civility was exactly what Stephens' email was about. It's a shame that Karpf and others like him who use social media do not understand the meaning of civility.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Hackers took over the Twitter account of Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, on Friday and used the account to broadcast a string of racist messages and bomb threats.
In the posts, the attackers claimed that Twitter's San Francisco headquarters would be bombed, and used Mr. Dorsey's account to retweet posts from several individuals appearing to claim responsibility for the hack.
The brief takeover of Mr. Dorsey's Twitter account is a reminder of the risks facing celebrities, businesses and public officials that use Twitter. They are prominent targets for hackers and other troublemakers, but their accounts are often poorly protected and can be accessed by determined attackers.
The breach of Mr. Dorsey's account should also serve as a nudge to tech executives and everyday internet users who go online to shop, bank or simply post photos to pay close attention to the security of their online accounts.
Increasingly, protecting social media against hacking has had global political implications, and security experts have worried for several years that world leaders' accounts do not have sufficient protections.
In 2017, President Trump's Twitter account was momentarily deactivated by a contractor with Twitter, adding grist to conservative complaints that social media companies are biased.
Although Mr. Dorsey's account was only compromised for a few minutes, it was long enough for the hackers to unleash a string of offensive messages. The posts were quickly deleted from the account.
Hackers used a messaging service called CloudHopper, which Twitter acquired in 2010, to make posts under Mr. Dorsey's name. CloudHopper allows Twitter users who link their phone number to their account to tweet simply by sending a text message to Twitter.
Twitter confirmed in a statement that the account had been compromised because Mr. Dorsey's mobile provider made "a security oversight" that allowed hackers to send tweets via text message from his phone number.
"We're aware that @jack was compromised and investigating what happened," the company said in a tweet. "There is no indication that Twitter's systems have been compromised."
The group that took over Mr. Dorsey's account called itself Chuckling Squad and posted several hashtags promoting itself, as well as a link to a chat room on the online chat service Discord. Tali Fischer, a Discord spokeswoman, said the chat room was removed minutes after it was reported.
In testimony before a Senate committee last September, Mr. Dorsey said that he used two-factor authentication to secure his account. That is a security feature that requires a person to prove their identity using a password as well as a second credential, like a code sent to the person by text message or a hardware token.
But two-factor authentication is not infallible. Hackers sometimes trick or bribe phone company employees into transferring their target's phone number to a new SIM card, which stores a phone's number.
This practice, known as SIM-swapping, allows a hacker to intercept security codes sent by text message. Previous targets of Chuckling Squad hacks, including several prominent YouTube personalities, have had their accounts compromised after the hackers took control of their phone numbers.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was aware of the threat and had been in contact with Twitter.
The hackers also posted several messages from Mr. Dorsey's account using racial slurs and praising Adolf Hitler. Twitter has frequently been criticized for not acting quickly to remove offensive and anti-Semitic content on its platform, though it removed the posts made to Mr. Dorsey's account shortly after they were posted.
The incident on Friday was not the first time that Mr. Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of the financial technology company Square, has lost control of his Twitter account. In 2016, a group of hackers going by the name OurMine conducted a similar attack that allowed them to post from Mr. Dorsey's account.
The group also took over social media accounts belonging to Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook.
But OurMine's messages were not racist or violent. Instead, the hackers claimed they were simply testing the security practices of some of the most influential figures in the technology industry. OurMine also successfully took over a New York Times account and posted a hoax about a missile attack.
In 2014, in one of the broadest attacks on the online activities of celebrities, the private photos of dozens of well-known women were stolen and posted to message boards like 4chan and Reddit. Four years later, a Connecticut man was sentenced to eight months in prison for his part in the incident.

Texto completo: The Justice Department inspector general released a scathing report on former FBI Director James Comey's notes memorializing his conversations with President Trump, finding that he disclosed them without authorization "to achieve a personally desired outcome."
The 83-page report on Comey's handling of "sensitive information," released Thursday, said the investigation found "no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the Memos to members of the media."
But Inspector General Michael Horowitz faulted Comey for his behavior, saying his actions "violated Department or FBI policy, or the terms of Comey’s FBI Employment Agreement. As described in this report, we conclude that Comey’s retention, handling, and dissemination of certain Memos violated Department and FBI policies, and his FBI Employment Agreement."
Horowitz criminally referred Comey to the Justice Department for his conduct, but the agency declined to prosecute.
The report concluded that Comey "failed to live up to this responsibility. By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information."
Comey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, testified to Congress that he gave his notes of conversations he had with Trump to his friend Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor, to leak to the New York Times. He said he hoped this would spark a special counsel investigation. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed that same month to lead an investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.
Horowitz did not approve of Comey's course of action, criticizing him for not attempting other "lawful" ways to secure the appointment of a special counsel.
"Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure. What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome," Horowitz wrote.
In a pair of tweets, Comey emphasized how the report cleared him of leaking classified information to the media and took shots at his critics, including Trump, who said he leaked classified material to reporters and deserves to go to prison.
"DOJ IG 'found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.' I don’t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice," Comey tweeted soon after its release on Thursday.
Tweet
"And to all those who’ve spent two years talking about me 'going to jail' or being a 'liar and a leaker' — ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president," he added.
Tweet
Comey's critics were quick to trumpet his disregard for the rules, including Trump, who lashed out at his former FBI director on Twitter.
"Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General’s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!" Trump said.
Tweet
In a statement from the White House, press secretary Stephanie Grisham called Comey "a proven liar and leaker." Trump's Republican allies in Congress also piled on Comey.
"Today's report is a disappointing reminder that the former FBI Director put partisanship and personal ambition over patriotism and his legal obligations to the American people. By leaking his confidential communications with the President in an attempt to save face in the wake of his firing, Mr. Comey believed he was above the rules of the DOJ," Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.
"His actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump. I am grateful that the Inspector General brought these issues to light and look forward to his and Mr. Durham's findings related to abuses of the FISA process," the Georgia Republican added.
Sen. Lindsey Graham said the report is "a stunning and unprecedented rebuke of a former Director of the FBI" and thanked Horowitz and his team for their work.
“This is the first of what I expect will be several more ugly and damning rebukes of senior DOJ and FBI officials regarding their actions and biases toward the Trump campaign of 2016," the South Carolina Republican said. “I appreciate the time and effort Mr. Horowitz and his team spent documenting the off-the-rails behavior of Mr. Comey regarding the leaking of law enforcement materials to the media. I also appreciate Mr. Horowitz for reinforcing the proper standards expected of senior DOJ and FBI officials. Well done Mr. Horowitz.”

Comey also had his defenders, downplaying Horowitz's report.
"This is perhaps the stupidest investigation the IG has ever done, and one of its dumber conclusions. Talk about fiddling while Rome burns, " tweeted Matthew Miller, an Obama-era spokesman for the Justice Department. "The IG has basically faulted Comey for speeding on his way to tell the village that a fire was coming. Such a narrowly-scoped view of the world."
Comey, 58, served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in the early 2000s before joining the FBI. He became FBI director in 2013, under former President Barack Obama, and led the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails. He has been a target for Republicans and Democrats alike. Republicans often criticize him for recommending no charges against the then-Democratic presidential candidate. Meanwhile, Clinton and her allies blame Comey for contributing to her loss to Trump by reopening (then closing) the emails investigation weeks before election night.
In a 2018 report, Horowitz criticized Comey for being “insubordinate” and “affirmatively" concealing his intentions from Justice Department leadership during the investigation into Clinton's private email server. However, the watchdog did not find that bias tainted the investigation.
There were seven contemporaneous memos Comey wrote of his interactions with Trump between January and April 2017, spanning from prior to the inauguration to weeks before he was fired. They contain such claims as Trump seeking a loyalty pledge from Comey and pushing his FBI director to drop an investigation into his national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump has vociferously denied both these accounts.
Only a handful of FBI officials knew about Comey's memos in those days, and they told the inspector general they were "official government records." However, Comey described at least some of them as being personal. "Comey's characterization of the Memos as personal records finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations, and policies defining Federal records, and the terms of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement," Horowitz wrote.
The first memo focuses on Comey's initial one-on-one meeting with Trump on Jan. 7, in which he first notified the president-elect of an unverifed dossier, compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, on his alleged ties to Russia. Witnesses interviewed by Horowitz said they "discussed Trump's potential responses to being told about the 'salacious' information, including that Trump might make statements about, or provide information of value to, the pending Russian interference investigation."
Horowitz noted that "multiple FBI witnesses recalled agreeing ahead of time that Comey should memorialize his meeting with Trump immediately after it occurred."
There was some concern among the FBI's top officials that the memos about his conversations with Trump would look bad. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker told the inspector general that "at the time, it was his understanding that the small group of people who had access to the Memos 'really didn't want anyone to know the Director… was recording at this level of detail his interactions with the President' because any perception that Comey was 'keeping … book' on the President would upset any effort to have an effective and ongoing working relationship."
Comey defended his creation of the memos. Horowitz wrote that Comey said it "was important for FBI executive managers to be 'able to share in [Comey's] recall of the … salient details of those conversations.' Comey also said that an additional concern, shared by the members of his management team, was that if the briefing became 'a source of controversy' it would be important to have a clear, contemporaneous record because Trump might 'misrepresent what happened in the encounter.'”
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who may soon be facing criminal charges for lying to federal agents, told the inspector general "that, in his view, it made sense for Comey 'to capture his … contemporaneous recollection' because there were “millions of ways that [the FBI] could get follow-up questions, or criticism … and [Comey] wanted to recollect exactly, from his perspective, how it had taken place.'”
Some of the memos did contain classified information, but not the ones that were leaked to the media. The inspector general report explains the creation and handling of each memo, including a detailed timeline of events.
Horowitz said his team conducted 17 interviews, including with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and Richman, and found the FBI did not learn that Comey had shared any of the memos with anyone outside the FBI until Comey testified to Congress on June 8, 2017.
Comey told the inspector general that he feared cyber intrusion, printing out copies of his memos before deleting an electronic file. He also scanned some of the memos and used a private email account to send them to his attorneys. "Comey explained to the OIG that he is 'a maniac … about hacking of [his] personal devices' and that he is 'obsessive' about deleting files from his personal accounts. He told us that he 'never keep[s] any emails, personal emails' and tries 'to maintain almost a maniacal hygiene about records,'" the report said.
Last month, documents obtained by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information lawsuit showed FBI special agents from the Washington Field Office paid a visit to Comey's home on June 7, 2017, at which time he gave them four of the memos as "evidence." These copies were kept in a safe, to which he told the inspector general "in theory" his wife had access, but not a key.
When Comey was fired, Trump initially cited a memo written by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which focused on the "mistakes" Comey made in handling the investigation into Clinton's unauthorized email server. But a couple of days later, the president suggested a different motive in an interview with NBC, saying the “Russia thing” was a factor in firing Comey.
Comey, who has been a vocal critic of the president and his treatment of the FBI, is also a possible target of Horowitz's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse. He signed three of the four FISA applications targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page before being fired by Trump. Horowitz's report is expected to be released after Labor Day. It is also likely that Comey's actions as FBI director will be scrutinized during the "investigation of the investigators," a review of the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, being led by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham.
Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, said as recently as last night on Fox News that Comey should go to prison for lying to the FISA Court.
"The reality is that Comey's conduct was outrageous for a prosecutor. Any decent prosecutor, when we’re bouncing off the walls, starting with the completely fixed Hillary Clinton investigation. That was a sellout, a fix from day one. It’s a disgrace. I don't think J. Edgar Hoover ever did that," he told Fox News.

Texto completo: Snowflakery knows no political bent, and hostility towards the free press is a grievance centuries older than the First Amendment. The twin tales of Playboy's Brian Karem and Breitbart's Joel Pollak exemplifies the oft ignored fact that people in power of all political stripes simply despise answering to the Fourth Estate.
Karem's currently fighting the Trump administration in the courtroom to reclaim his hard pass, which the White House suspended following the journalist's verbal sparring match with an equally belligerent Sebastian Gorka during the president's social media summit in the Rose Garden.
Beto O'Rourke staffers booted Pollak from a campaign event, with the 2020 longshot's spokeswoman lambasting as "hateful" and bordering on "perpetrat[ing] hate speech."
Both fights are absurd, and not because of the journalists prolonging them.
Neither Karem nor Pollak have hidden their ideological or partisan affinities. The Playboy White House correspondent openly excoriates the president on Twitter, while Pollak's persona and outlet are openly conservative. But both do actual journalism, and petty politicians have no right to sit in judgment. As long as they're going to claim they support a free press, the Trumps and Betos of the world must tolerate the scrutiny, tough questions, and even intentional rhetorical provocations that come as a natural responsibility of power.
Lost in the war between Trump and cable news anchors are the duties of actual journalists. Conservatives can rightly gripe at political operatives masquerading as reporters whining about Trump from their air conditioned studio sets, and liberals can rightly balk at conservatives normalizing and excusing behavior from Trump that would drive them into an apoplectic rage. Yet all the rage towards "fake news" ignores and discounts the importance of conservative outlets covering Democratic events and politicians, and vice versa.
There may be hope after all, even if it's not coming from the top bosses at news outlets. After Pollack was ousted from the Beto event, multiple New York Times reporters came to his defense.TweetTweetJust look at the comment section of either of those tweets to understand how vital it is that members of press across all political stripes stand up for each other. The more lefty anchors slam Fox News and any dissenting voice, the more the media allows politicians and the powerful to sideline and shut down journalism. When Times reporters do the right thing and stand up for fellow reporters, the public can't help but balk at them defying the expectation set by prime-time pundits.
Whether Karem has a legal right to his hard pass is still uncertain. Nor should there be a law demanding that open campaign events accommodate every legitimate journalist wishing to cover them. But as a matter of principle, a free society should expect that our elected elite answer to the press, and when they refuse to, we must demand it.

Texto completo: Harry Reid is starting to make sense.
I was afraid this day would come. Perhaps it's an indication of the Apocalypse or, at the very least, that blows to the head, received during my amateur athletic career, have finally caught up with me.
It's amazing what a politician will say when he isn't running for anything or trying to hold onto power. This is one among many reasons I favor term limits, which are about as realistic as an Uber to Mars.
Nevertheless, the former Senate Democratic leader has called out his party's presidential candidates for their unrealistic solutions to intractable problems such as rising health care costs and illegal immigration. Reid recently told Vice that Bernie Sanders' "Medicare-for-All" plan is the wrong way to go on health care. He favors retooling Obamacare.
Reid might have also added, but didn't, that it would be nice if Democrats would come up with an economic policy that wasn't hatched on the campus of Sherwood Forest University in the Robin Hood School of Economics.
"We will tax the hell out of the wealthy," said Bill de Blasio, Democratic candidate for president. He's also rumored to be mayor of New York City, but no one has seen him there recently.
I realize hating rich people and wanting to take their money and give it to someone else is in vogue right now, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. If you are one of those "Stick-it-to-the-man!" proponents, you need to realize that you might actually be "the man" or "woman" or "person" one of these days.
The Democrats' wish list of free stuff — health care for everyone, student loan forgiveness, college tuition, a guaranteed job — would total about $41 trillion. As Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute wrote in December, the math doesn't work. Even if you took every penny from the top 1 percent, you wouldn't fund a Medicare-for-all program. And doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) "would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close."
What all that means is the middle class will eventually bear the burden of these government giveaways.
This isn't about "fairness" either. "The top-earning 20 percent of taxpayers earn 53 percent of the income, yet pay 69 percent of all federal taxes, including 88 percent of all income taxes," Riedl wrote, based on numbers from the Congressional Budget Office.
So, the idea that the rich will fund the Democratic Socialist agenda is either a leftist fantasy or a lie. The odd thing is progressives push these policies despite the fact that we can all see they don't work.
California, for example, long under Democratic control, has become what progressives claim to abhor — a place where only the super wealthy thrive.
There is a serious shortage of affordable housing in California. Yet, the Democratic legislature doesn't seem to have the stomach to do anything about it.
"Not-in-my-backyardism is a bipartisan sentiment," wrote New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo, "but because the largest American cities are populated and run by Democrats — many in states under complete Democratic control — this sort of nakedly exclusionary urban restrictionism is a particular shame of the left."
It's a searing indictment of ultra-progressivism, but for those who think he's wrong, the evidence suggests otherwise. You might have heard about California liberals wanting to secede from the United States.
There are a lot of reasons why they won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
Mainly, they won't be able to afford the gas.

Texto completo: This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting .
GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- The former Guantánamo Bay prison commander's mishandling of classified information led to his firing in April, a war court prosecutor said on Wednesday. The disclosure was the first public explanation of the abrupt dismissal of the admiral who had publicly campaigned for Congress to fund more permanent prison facilities at Guantánamo.
The commander, Rear Adm. John C. Ring, was relieved on April 27 by Adm. Craig S. Faller, the leader of Southern Command, who declared a loss of confidence in Admiral Ring's leadership without explaining further.
The revelation on Wednesday came from Navy Cmdr. Kevin L. Flynn, a prosecutor in a pretrial hearing for an Iraqi prisoner accused of commanding Qaeda forces that committed war crimes in Afghanistan in 2003 and 2004. Commander Flynn said Admiral Ring's firing was unrelated to his remarks to reporters this year about the need to build a prison that envisions end-of-life care at Guantánamo for former C.I.A. prisoners.
Defense lawyers for the prisoner, Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, had sought information about the firing to argue that Mr. Hadi's health care was not in compliance with the Geneva Conventions. Navy surgeons conducted five spine surgeries on him at Guantánamo in nine months, starting in September 2017. He now relies on a wheelchair, a walker and painkillers.
But Commander Flynn said Admiral Ring's firing had nothing to do with the Hadi case or his public advocacy for "improvements of detention facilities." He said that an investigation found that the admiral had mishandled classified information and that he was not candid about it. The prosecutor did not elaborate on the nature of the information or how it was mishandled, including whether it was disclosed to the public.
The trial judge, Lt. Col. Michael D. Libretto, denied a request by Mr. Hadi's lawyers for information about the firing. But Colonel Libretto, a Marine, ordered the prosecution to provide defense lawyers with any documents or reports by "knowledgeable officials" that could have informed Admiral Ring's public statements of deteriorating conditions at the maximum-security lockup where Mr. Hadi is imprisoned.
The building is called Camp 7 and houses 14 men who were previously held by the C.I.A. in its secret "black site" overseas prison network. The other 26 prisoners at Guantánamo are mostly held in two other prison buildings called Camp 5 and Camp 6.
Military commanders have been talking about the need to replace Camp 7 since at least 2013. John F. Kelly, the Southern Command leader at the time who would become President Trump's first homeland security secretary and second chief of staff, pressed Congress to commit $ 49 million to build a new prison. The cost of construction ballooned to $ 69 million in 2018, when Admiral Ring began pushing for a new, wheelchair-accessible prison that complied with the Geneva Conventions. Congress has consistently refused to fund it.
Two prosecutors on the Hadi case traveled to Miami two weeks ago to read the report on the Ring investigation at the headquarters of the Southern Command, which oversees prison operations at Guantánamo, Commander Flynn said. He said prosecutors gave Mr. Hadi's lawyers an executive summary of the investigation last week.
The judge was handed a copy in court on Wednesday and read it on the spot.
A defense lawyer for Mr. Hadi, Navy Lt. Mishael A. Danielson, said his team found the reasons for Admiral Ring's firing to be vague. The summary was critical of his leadership style and said he tried to consolidate communications under his command, Lieutenant Danielson said.
Neither Admiral Ring nor his Navy lawyer responded to requests for comment. A Southern Command spokeswoman, Col. Amanda I. Azubuike, declined to comment because The New York Times has a pending Freedom of Information lawsuit against the Defense Department to obtain a copy of the 108-page Ring report, which was completed Aug. 1.
The same day Admiral Ring was relieved of his command, The Times published an article online that quoted him extensively on Pentagon planning for terrorism suspects to grow old and die at Guantánamo Bay. The military announced his firing the next day.
The new prison commander is Rear Adm. Timothy C. Kuehhas, who has not engaged with reporters since taking over in May.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: The New York Times has begun a major initiative, the "1619 Project," to observe the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe American history so that slavery and the contributions of black Americans explain who we are as a nation.
Nikole Hannah-Jones, staff writer for The New York Times Magazine wrote the lead article, "America Wasn’t a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One." She writes, "Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not be a democracy at all." There are several challenges one can make about Hannah-Jones’ article, but I’m going to focus on the article’s most serious error, namely that the nation’s founders intended for us to be a democracy. That error is shared by too many Americans. The word democracy appears nowhere in the two most fundamental founding documents of our nation — the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. Instead of a democracy, the Constitution’s Article IV, Section 4, declares, "The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government."
The founders had utter contempt for democracy. James Madison, the acknowledged father of the Constitution, wrote in Federalist Paper No. 10, that in a pure democracy "there is nothing to check the inducement to sacrifice the weaker party or the obnoxious individual." At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, delegate Edmund Randolph said, "that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy."
The U.S. Constitution is replete with anti-majority rule, undemocratic provisions. One provision, heavily criticized, is the Electoral College. In their wisdom, the framers gave us the Electoral College so that in presidential elections, heavily populated states could not run roughshod over sparsely populated states. In order to amend the Constitution, it requires a two-thirds vote of both Houses, or two-thirds of state legislatures, to propose an amendment, and requires three-fourths of state legislatures for ratification.
In addition to not understanding our Constitution, Hannah-Jones’ article, like in most discussions of black history, fails to acknowledge that black Americans have made the greatest gains, over some of the highest hurdles in the shortest span of time than any other racial group in mankind’s history. The evidence: If black Americans were thought of as a nation with our own gross domestic product, we’d rank among the 20 wealthiest nations. It was a black American, Gen. Colin Powell, who headed the world’s mightiest military. A few black Americans are among the world’s wealthiest. Black Americans are among the world’s most famous personalities.
In 1865, neither a slave nor a slave owner would have believed that such progress would be possible in less than a century and a half, if ever. As such, it speaks to the intestinal fortitude of a people. Just as importantly, it speaks to the greatness of a nation within which such progress was possible, progress that would have been impossible anywhere else. The challenge before us is how those gains can be extended to a large percentage of black people for whom they appear elusive.

Sacklers would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma under settlement proposal

Texto completo: The Sackler family would give up ownership of Purdue Pharma, the company blamed for much of the opioid epidemic, and pay $3 billion of their own money under terms of a settlement proposal to resolve thousands of federal and state lawsuits, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.
The discussions have been going on for months as Purdue and the Sacklers have sought to prevent any new lawsuits against individual members of the family as well as their company.
If all the parties agree and the settlement is completed, Purdue would be the first among some two dozen manufacturers, distributors and retailers of prescription opioids facing lawsuits nationwide to settle all claims against it for its role in a public health crisis that has killed hundreds of thousands of people in the past two decades.
A document outlining a tentative negotiated agreement, which was described to The New York Times, valued the family’s and company’s contributions at between $10 billion and $12 billion, including the $3 billion Sackler contribution.
But it would not be a straightforward cash payout. The bulk of the funds would come from restructuring the company under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that would transform it from a private company into a “public beneficiary trust.” That would allow the profits from all drug sales, including the opioid painkiller OxyContin, to go to the plaintiffs — largely states, cities, towns and tribes.
In addition, the company would give its addiction treatment drugs to the public without cost. Those drugs are under development and have received fast-track review status by the Food and Drug Administration. They include tablets to blunt opioid cravings and an over-the-counter nasal spray to reverse overdoses.
The value of the profits from the new trust and the drug donations is estimated to total between $7 billion and $8 billion.
In addition to their $3 billion cash payout, the Sacklers would sell another drug company they own, Mundipharma, and contribute an additional $1.5 billion from the proceeds.
The settlement talks were first reported by NBC. Purdue emailed a statement in response to the reports: “While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals. The people and communities affected by the opioid crisis need help now. Purdue believes a constructive global resolution is the best path forward, and the company is actively working with the state attorneys general and other plaintiffs to achieve this outcome.”
The Sacklers declined to comment.
Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, who filed the first state lawsuit against individual Sackler family members, declined to comment on the content of the settlement negotiations.
The settlement talks have been underway for months, largely at the behest of Judge Dan Polster, the federal judge in Cleveland who is overseeing some 2,000 lawsuits by the local governments against companies in the opioids industry.
Purdue wants to achieve what is called a global settlement — an agreement by all parties that would end the lawsuits. To reach that goal, both the states, whose cases have been brought by their respective attorneys general, and the federal plaintiffs would have to make a unified agreement with Purdue.
The framework for the agreement and which plaintiffs would sign on to it are still in flux. People familiar with the discussions expressed dismay that news was leaked at the 11th hour, just before the participants were to give a status report to Polster on Friday. Some worried that the publicity could compromise the already delicate talks.
Polster had ordered all participants not to speak to anyone outside the negotiations about the content.
The executive committee for the plaintiffs issued a terse statement to The New York Times: “Per Judge Polster’s confidentiality order that we will respect, we cannot speak publicly to any speculation or media reports on settlement negotiations with the defendants we are preparing to litigate against in federal court this fall.”
About 10 states have been at the negotiation talks. What remains to be seen is whether the other 38 or so states that have filed lawsuits will agree. Also up in the air is whether a larger group of 34,000 cities and counties that have not yet filed lawsuits would agree to be bound by this framework.
If the agreement can be completed, Purdue would immediately file for bankruptcy and be under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge. The judge would appoint three independent trustees, who would in turn name a board of directors for the new public beneficiary trust. The independent trustees and the board would make all decisions about how the revenues from continuing operation of Purdue’s businesses should be handled.
The Sacklers would no longer be involved in the companies founded by three Sackler brothers in the 1950s.
Although Purdue has a relatively small share of the opioid market in the United States, its introduction of the prescription painkiller OxyContin in 1996 and no-holds-barred sales tactics are widely seen as initiating the two-decade-long slide into opioid addiction that gripped the country.
Even as early as 2007, Purdue and three top executives pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the drug’s risk of addiction and its potential to be abused. But despite paying a fine of $600 million, the company continued its aggressive promotion of the drug, playing down its risk and overselling its benefits.

Former Obama White House Counsel Takes Stand in His Own Trial; Greg Craig denies lying to government about work he has done for Ukraine

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—Former White House counsel Greg Craig took the stand in his own criminal trial , rebutting allegations that he misled the government about his work for Ukraine in 2012.
Mr. Craig on Wednesday repeatedly and categorically denied lying to the Justice Department unit that enforces the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, about whether he was part of a public-relations campaign to brief the media about a report prepared for the government of Ukraine.
"I did not lie to the FARA unit," Mr. Craig said under questioning from his defense attorney, though he did acknowledge giving a "muddled" answer about his interactions with a New York Times journalist.
Mr. Craig—an influential Washington lawyer and counselor to former President Obama and President Clinton—found himself in an unfamiliar position on Wednesday: as a witness in a courtroom, fighting for acquittal on a felony charge and defending the reputation that he has built up in nearly 50 years of legal practice and government service.
Mr. Craig's testimony on the stand is something of a rarity in modern criminal trials, where prosecutors bear the burden of proving their case and defendants are protected by a constitutional right against self-incrimination. It can be risky for a defendant to take the stand since it gives prosecutors a chance at cross examination.
In a full day of testimony, Mr. Craig told his story to a crowded courtroom—first, under the gentle probing from his defense lawyers, and then under aggressive questioning from prosecutors. Mr. Craig is expected to continue his testimony on Thursday.
Mr. Craig's legal woes began when he was hired in 2012 by the government of Ukraine to evaluate the fairness of the corruption trial of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Mr. Craig and his then-law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP concluded that Ms. Tymoshenko's trial didn't meet Western standards of justice.
The legal case against Mr. Craig turns on contacts he had with reporters from four media outlets. Prosecutors contend that Mr. Craig contacted journalists from the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, National Law Journal and the Daily Telegraph of the U.K. as part of a media blitz. At the time, Ukraine was looking to burnish the country's image internationally and defend itself against charges that Ms. Tymoshenko prosecution was politically motivated.
They said he subsequently misled and concealed information about those contacts from the Justice Department office, in violation of federal law.
The government accused Mr. Craig of choosing to "lie and conceal" his role in the Ukrainian campaign, Assistant United States Attorney Molly Gaston said at the opening of the trial. Prosecutors said he didn't want to register under the FARA law as an agent of a foreign government because of the stigma that such a status carried.
Legal work of the kind being performed by Skadden for Ukraine wouldn't necessarily call for registration under the FARA law, but any kind of U.S. public-relations work typically requires registration as a foreign agent.
Mr. Craig told the jury that he didn't trust the public-relations team assembled by Ukraine and believed they were preparing to misrepresent the conclusions of the report. Mr. Craig said that he spoke to journalists to defend the integrity of his work and that his published comments weren't helpful to Ukraine's point of view.
"We were trying to correct mistakes and errors that Ukraine itself was distributing to the public. If we are trying to correct what Ukraine is doing, we're doing something contrary to the interest of our client—how could you consider us to be agents of the client?" Mr. Craig said.
In particular, Mr. Craig testified that he didn't trust a British public-relations consultant named Jonathan Hawker, who was called last week as a witness for the prosecution. Emails entered into evidence showed that Mr. Hawker repeatedly crafted talking points and other materials that misrepresented Skadden's report.
Mr. Craig said that Mr. Hawker shared with him draft press materials that inaccurately stated the conclusions of the Skadden report on Ms. Tymoshenko. Specifically, the public-relations consultants wanted to say that the Skadden report found no evidence that the Tymoshenko trial was politically motivated—when in fact, the Skadden team had declined to address the issue.
The interactions with Mr. Hawker and the press materials that he prepared "gave me great concern about his integrity, his honesty, and reliability. I didn't trust him," Mr. Craig testified.
The charges against Mr. Craig grew out of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and his yearslong work for the pro-Russia regime that was in power in Kiev at the time. Mr. Manafort and his associate Richard Gates pleaded guilty to crimes related to their work in Ukraine.
Mr. Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to face charges from the Russia probe. He left Skadden last year.
The single false-statement charge against Mr. Craig carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, though offenders with no prior criminal record typically serve far less jail time.

Texto completo: Danielle Welch, 52, of Red Bank, grew up in New Mexico butchering her own meat. She came from a family of hunters — skinning, slicing and trimming animals was expected. Imagine her family's fury when, as a teen, she became a vegetarian. She was cutting through the sinew on a hunk of venison one day and suddenly became nauseated by the blood. From that day on, she couldn't stomach meat. "I couldn't get the smell of blood out of my skin for weeks," Welch said. "That was it for me." For the next 13 years not a single bite of spicy sausage, tender sirloin or crispy chicken passed through her lips. Every time she smelled meat, all she could think of was deer blood. Until one day she changed her mind while visiting friends. "They made steaks, and they actually smelled good to me instead of like blood. So, I decided to eat one," she remembered.
Her disgust at meat was gone. In its stead was more focus and energy brought on by the protein her body was benefiting from, she said. She bid vegetarianism farewell and has been a carnivore ever since.
Is vegetarian healthier? Not necessarily In a world of scare-tactic documentaries, dewy-skinned vegan Instagrammers and bogus health blogs, it's no wonder many think veganism and vegetarianism will lead to a trim waist, glowing complexion, laser-sharp focus, perfect health, and the ability to do hundreds of V-sits in a row. But science and experience say otherwise.
"There's still a lot of junk food that's vegan," said Dawn Cascio, director of food and nutrition at Valley Hospital. "There are vegan chocolate chip cookies. A lot of processed foods like potato chips are vegan. If you don't focus on fresh fruits and veggies and unprocessed grains, you could gain a lot of weight."
As a vegetarian, Welch turned to pasta and bread to supplement her diet and wound up packing on pounds. "You're having so many starches and grains," she said. "Our bodies are not meant to break all those down. We're not cows."
Sometimes cutting out meat and dairy can be downright dangerous.
For proof, look no further than the infamous case of YouTuber Yovana Mendoza Ayres, or Rawvana as she's known. Ayres runs a vegan blog and YouTube channel, where she extols the virtues of raw vegan living (eating only plant-based foods that aren't cooked). She also sells raw vegan meal plans on her website.
But her goose was cooked when earlier this year she appeared in a fellow YouTuber's video eating (cue dramatic music)... fish! Ayres took to the Internet to do some "splaining. She said in a video that after beginning her raw vegan diet she stopped getting her period. Doctors told her that her "hormones were out of wack." She needed to eat more fat and cook her food. She was anemic and her thyroid levels were low. Then she got SIBO, a small intestinal bacteria overgrowth that can lead to malnourishment. After some advice from a nutritionist, she reintroduced eggs and fish into her diet to regain her health, all the while maintaining to her fans that she only ate raw vegan food.
'There's no one-size-fits-all diet' Of course, eating less meat and more plants for good health isn't all phooey. According to Cascio, thorough research shows a link between eating processed meats and an increased risk in developing cancer and heart disease. Eating less meat also shrinks one's carbon footprint and can reduce cruel farming practices.
Just ask Beyonce, or rather her personal trainer Marco Borges. Borges, a nutrition author who recently released the plant-based recipe book "The Greenprint," has pioneered a 22-day vegan nutrition challenge, best known for being used and endorsed by Queen B and Jay-Z.
Borges also conducted a clinical study with Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. He found that over 22 days, people who ate a whole foods (foods grown out of the ground) vegan diet saw positive results. When compared to people who ate a vegetarian diet, their BMIs (body mass index) went down five times more, their body fat reduced by four times more and their cholesterol decreased 400 percent.
If this study is any proof, cutting out meat and dairy can shed pounds and be good for your heart. But not all vegan diets are made the same.
"It's really important to distinguish between whole food plant-based and being vegan... A whole food plant-based diet is vegan, but vegan isn't always whole-food plant based," Borges said. "Whole foods come from the earth like rice, whole grains and beans Not waffles, Impossible burgers and French fries, which are also vegan"
Doctor Iris Erguder-Saman agrees. She's an MD in family medicine and the director of integrative medicine at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. Erguder-Saman works with people who are looking to make big changes to their diet. Her tips? Avoid processed foods like veggie burgers and talk to a doctor before cutting major food groups out of your diet.
"There's no one-size-fits-all diet. Some diets work for some individuals," she said. "It's all about having a conversation and consulting with a healthcare professional."
Getting back together with meat Kassandra Gutierrez, 28, owner of the meal prep and food delivery service The Malleable Palate which is based out of Paterson, says she felt "lighter" and "better" as a vegan. A trained chef, Gutierrez knew which foods to substitute into her diet to stay healthy.
When she was 20 years old she decided to go pescatarian (eating only fish and plant-based foods), then vegetarian, then vegan, after watching the documentary "Forks Over Knives." The film advocates eating plant-based proteins instead of animal proteins, claiming the switch will reduce diseases like cancer and diabetes. But something was missing.
"I enjoy the umami flavor. I craved steak the most when I was pescatarian, seafood when I was vegetarian, and probably cheese when I was vegan," she said. After six months of being vegan, she went back to eating meat.
Jennifer Levine of Montclair went vegetarian while attending UMass Amherst because the food that came with the plant-base dining plan looked better than the others. When she graduated, Levine decided to stay vegetarian. "It became a habit," she said.
About eight years later she went to a deli with her boyfriend. She was about to order her usual meatless sandwich when her boyfriend suggested something life-changing – "Why don't you try the turkey sub?"
"It was radical. That was kind of a turning point," Levine said. She ordered the turkey sub. Then started eating meat again. Levine noticed she had more energy from that point on.
"As a vegetarian, I was carb-loading. I wasn't getting adequate protein," she said. "Since I've started eating meat again, I have a much more refined awareness of what I'm eating."
Oscar-winning actress (and fellow New Jerseyan) Anne Hathaway scrapped veganism after a fateful dinner with her husband Adam Shulman and Matt Damon. The three were dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Iceland. Shulman and Damon asked to eat whatever the chef was making. Hathaway asked if the salmon they were serving was local.
"And they said: 'Do you see that fjord?'" she told the publication Tatler. "So I had a piece of salmon and my brain felt like a computer rebooting."
As a vegan, "I just didn't feel good or healthy ... not strong," she said later to Harper's Bazaar.
Even Jane Brody, personal health columnist and long-time specialist in medicine and biology for the New York Times, weighed in in her 2017 column "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan." Her article was published in The Times in response to the "misstatements" made in the popular Netflix documentary "What The Health."
Eating an egg every day is just as bad as smoking five cigarettes? Eating one serving of processed meat a day raises your risk of getting diabetes 51 percent? All things the documentary claimed. All wrong, said Brody.
In the column she pointed to studies published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Harvard's Department of Nutrition. Both found that eating a primarily plant-based diet would reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, but left room for "various amounts of animal products" in their subjects' diets, wrote Brody. She also drew the distinction between good vegan food (read: broccoli) and bad vegan food (read: vegan chocolate chip cookies). The former will most likely be a positive for your health. The latter most likely will not.
"Eating is so personal and cultural," said Cascio of Valley Hospital. "Everybody is different and needs to find a diet they personally feel great on... If you feel like crap on it, it might not be for you."

Texto completo: The man whose mother's burial was delayed in Israel over his alleged refusal to give his wife a religious divorce said reports that he had changed his mind are "fake news."
He identified himself as Yisrael Meir Kin in an English-language video released to the religious news website Arutz Sheva. He appears in the video with a tear in his shirt, as is traditionally worn during the week of shiva after a close relative dies. He released a similar video in Hebrew to Israel's Channel 13.
His mother's body arrived in Israel on Monday night, Aug. 19. A Tuesday morning burial was scheduled, but did not take place until hours later, reportedly until he agreed to give the religious divorce, or get. Kin did not travel to Israel for the burial, reportedly because he could have been arrested for get refusal.
The rabbinical court of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada reportedly had asked Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau to withhold the burial until Kin agreed to the get and noted in a letter to the Chief Rabbinate that the man's mother supported him in his decision to keep his wife an agunah, or chained woman. Lau in a statement announced that he would comply with the request.
Lau later said that Kin's family had placed a $20,000 bond to ensure that he would produce the get for his wife in front of a rabbinical court when one was arranged.
But Kin says in the video that neither Lau nor anyone from the chief rabbinate contacted him nor did he or his family place a deposit to insure the get. He also pointed out that he is related to Lau by marriage through his wife.
Lau had an "interest in doing this heinous crime against my mother," Kin charged.
He also said that he provided a get for his wife at the Beit Din of Shaarey Mishpat, which is headed by Rabbi Tzvi Dov Abraham of Monsey, and which is not recognized by any rabbinical organization in North America nor by the chief rabbinate in Israel. The court is "universally reviled as extortionist," the Jewish Journal in Los Angelesreported in 2009.
The New York Times in 2014 reported that Kim was demanding $500,000 and full custody of their then-12-year-old son in exchange for the divorce.
The chief rabbinate denied Kin's claims. "We regret that the refuser continues his crooked conduct and is now attacking the Beit Din (rabbinical court)," the Chief Rabbi's office told Arutz 7.

‘AN AGGRESSIVE NEW THING’ — HOW SANDERS WOULD RAMP UP FEDERAL ROLE IN ELECTRICITY GENERATION: Bernie Sanders’ climate change plan diverges from his rivals by envisioning a massive expansion of the federal government’s role in electricity generation as a means of getting more wind and solar onto the power grid.
Sanders, a self-described socialist, proposes to expand the use of federally owned utilities, like the Tennessee Valley Authority, to build out new wind, solar, energy storage, and geothermal power plants, as a fast-acting mechanism to achieve his goal of 100% renewable energy for electricity by 2030.
This would be a dramatic shift from federal owned utilities’ current focus on generating power from hydroelectric dams and fossil fuels.
“I am not sure he is proposing to nationalize the entire electricity sector, but he is proposing to be more aggressive in using federal power agencies to promote wind and solar on a utility scale,” David Spence, a University of Texas law professor who focuses on energy regulation, told me. “That is a really big change and an aggressive new thing.”
What Sanders would do: He is not exactly proposing to nationalize power generation, energy experts say, but the effort would be a colossal undertaking that would likely be met with resistance from private utilities and Congress, which would have to pass new legislation.
Essentially, Sanders wants to expand the use of Power Marketing Administrations, which are agencies under the purview of the Energy Department that operate transmission lines and sell electricity generated at federally owned hydroelectric dams in 34 states.
The four existing PMAs, are they are known, are the Bonneville Power Administration, Western Area Power Administration, Southeastern Power Administration, and Southwestern Power Administration. Sanders wants to create a fifth PMA to cover the remaining states and territories and expand the existing PMAs to build "more than enough wind, solar, energy storage and geothermal power plants."
“This plan is unserious and, put simply, it is not going to happen,” Travis Kavulla, director of energy at the R Street Institute, told me. “This plan is causing everyone who knows an iota about the PMAs to give a big, collective eyeroll,” added Kavulla, who worked closely with the Bonneville Power Administration as a Montana utility commissioner.
Sanders also envisions the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public utility covering parts of seven southeast states, producing more wind and solar, shifting from its historical focus on coal power.
"Look, the TVA has done a lot of good work ... What we need to do is have an aggressive federal government saying that we are going to produce a massive amount of energy from solar and from wind and from other sustainable energies," Sanders said in an appearance on MSNBC last week.
Sanders vows to spend $1.52 trillion to convert the operations of federal utilities to focus on renewable energy and an additional $852 billion to build energy storage capacity.
His campaign says the “revenue from sales of federally owned renewables” will help pay for his climate change agenda, which would cost $16.3 trillion to implement, an amount that Sanders says would “pay for itself” over 15 years.
What it all means: Ari Peskoe, director of the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative, told me he interprets Sanders’ plan to mean that PMAs would mostly be charged with renewable energy development instead of private developers. However, he said, existing private utilities could continue to deliver power to consumers. And presumably, regional grid operators and other actors would retain their responsibilities for ensuring the reliability of the power grid.
He said an unanswered question is whether PMAs would develop and build projects themselves or contract with established developers.
“Sanders is not ‘nationalizing the energy system,’” said Peskoe, who emphasized he was speaking in a personal capacity, and not on behalf of Harvard University’s views. “The wind and solar industries have scaled up tremendously over the past decade. Sanders’ plan would ignore the competitive wind and solar development markets in favor of PMAs and transform them into the largest renewable energy developers in the world.”
What the impact could be: Other experts said Sanders’ plan is not entirely unprecedented in its intent, using the power of the federal government to achieve a national policy goal. But they warned of potential consequences in disrupting growing private capital investment into renewables.
“Vastly expanded federal ownership of energy resources comes with risk,” a former federal official now working with clean energy companies told me. “If the federal government locks itself into certain technologies today, customers could pay for them for years in the future even after technology has advanced. Energy technology development is moving so fast that it may be better for investors to take on that risk, rather than customers via government ownership.”

BIDEN BASHES TRUMP FOR IGNORING CLIMATE CHANGE AT G-7 MEETING: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden bashed President Trump Tuesday for ignoring climate change at the Group of Seven meeting in France.
Trump did not join the rest of G-7 members in attending a meeting Monday focused on climate change and the environment, despite indicating in a speech last month that he intended to focus on his environmental record heading into the 2020 election.
“There is no more telling metaphor for this administration's abdication of American global leadership than the empty chair at the G-7 climate meeting,” Biden said in a statement. “When it comes to meeting the existential crisis of our time, Trump has walked away from the table—literally.”
Biden rebuked Trump for suggesting to reporters at the conclusion of the G-7 gathering that climate change is not worth addressing if it interferes with U.S. “wealth” derived from fossil fuels.
"I'm not going to lose that wealth,” Trump said. “I'm not going lose it on dreams, on windmills.”
Biden said Trump is flubbing the facts of growing wind and solar use in the U.S.
“If we give Trump four more years, the planet may never recover from his utter disregard for the climate crisis and scientific fact,” Biden said.
BRAZIL REJECTS MILLIONS PLEDGED AT G-7 TO FIGHT FIRES: As fires rage in the Amazon rainforest, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration rejected $20 million in aid from the G-7 that was pledged to fight them.
Bolsonaro’s chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, suggested that the funds be used elsewhere.
“We are thankful, but maybe those resources would be more relevant to reforest Europe,” Lorenzoni told Brazilian media.
French President Emmanuel Macron has been outspoken about the need for other countries to help fight the blazes, which are up 84% from last year, according to Brazil’s space agency. The Amazon produces 20% of the world's oxygen and is vital to combating climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide.
During the G-7 summit, Macron announced it was making $20 million in aid available to the country to fight the fires.
Bolsonaro criticized the idea of international aid and said he worried it would signal an attack on his country’s sovereignty. He said an alliance would be delegitimizing Brazil as “a colony or no man's land.”
Later Tuesday, Bolsonaro told reporters in Brazil he was willing to reconsider accepting the aid from G-7 countries on the condition that Macron withdraws "insults made to my person" and respects Brazil's sovereignty, the New York Times reported.
Bolsonaro, a right-wing politician who took office in January, has defunded environmental agencies, reduced enforcement in the Amazon, and encouraged deforestation to improve business development.
After initially downplaying the fires, Bolsonaro this weekend ordered the deployment of troops to fight the blazes.
TRUMP DEFENDS BOLSONARO’S HANDLING OF AMAZON FIRES: Trump defended Bolsanaro’s handling of the Amazon fires Tuesday.
“I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!” Trump said in a Twitter post.
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GENERATION IS OUTPACING COAL: U.S. electricity generation from renewables outpaced coal for the second quarter of 2019, according to an analysis of Energy Information Administration data released Monday.
Renewable generation totaled 213.5 million megawatt-hours, topping the 210.6 million megawatt-hours generated by coal, the research group Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in an analysis of the EIA data.
“The numbers are admittedly close and could change with future revisions, but the trend is clear. Renewables are eating into coal’s market share — further evidence that the transition to a cleaner generation sector is well under way,” said Dennis Wamsted, associate editor of IEEFA.
IEEFA included wind, solar (including small-scale rooftop solar), hydro, biomass, and geothermal in its analysis of renewable generation compared to coal.
EXXON PARTNERS UP ON NEW CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY: U.S. oil and gas giant ExxonMobil announced Monday it is partnering with Mosaic Materials to explore a new carbon capture technology.
Mosaic Materials’ technology uses porous solids to separate carbon dioxide from nearly any gas mixture, for use in everything from submarines to power plants.
Exxon’s agreement with the company seeks to “evaluate opportunities’ for industrial uses of the carbon capture technology.
“New technologies in carbon capture will be critical enablers for us to meet growing energy demands, while reducing emissions,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at Exxon. “Our agreement with Mosaic expands our carbon capture research portfolio to reduce costs and enable large-scale deployment.”

Texto completo: What should communities do as climate change escalates threats like sea-level rise?
Until now, much of the focus has been on disaster response, with very little discussion of orderly, strategic retreat from areas at risk. After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, the New York state governor’s office ran a public service announcement that made clear the focus would be on rebuilding.
But a paper published this month in the journal Science makes a case that, sometimes, retreating from nature instead of fighting it can actually open up new opportunities for communities.
“There’s a definite rhetoric of, ‘We’re going to build it back better. We’re going to win. We’re going to beat this. Something technological is going to come and it’s going to save us,’ ” said A.R. Siders, an assistant professor with the disaster research center at the University of Delaware and lead author of the paper.
“It’s like, let’s step back and think for a minute,” she said. “You’re in a fight with the ocean. You’re fighting to hold the ocean in place. Maybe that’s not the battle we want to pick.”
In fact, people have often retreated after catastrophic weather events. New Orleans, for example, lost roughly half of its population after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city’s population is still only 85% of what it was before the storm. But those retreats have generally been ad hoc, not managed, and not necessarily done with broader social interests in mind.
“After major storms, a lot of communities want to relocate,” Siders said. She noted that in New York after Sandy, a number of communities applied for buyout programs to relocate, but only two of them actually got funding.
That left people in those other communities with limited options, most of them bad.
If they were wealthy, they could walk away from their homes and take the financial loss. But if they had lower income, they often couldn’t make that decision and faced the prospect of remaining in houses they knew were at high risk of flooding. And even if they did manage to sell their homes, they wouldn’t be lessening the risks so much as transferring them to others.
The new paper lays out ways communities could practice managed retreats that would address their broader needs. Lack of access to reliable climate-hazard maps, for example, makes it difficult to make informed choices about risk. Such maps must be improved and updated regularly, the paper said.
“I’m so glad that these kinds of pieces are getting written and that they’re laying out this sort of agenda for research and practice and thinking around these like very inevitably thorny and conflictual questions of retreat,” said Liz Koslov an assistant professor in the department of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in the study.
If communities could practice strategic retreats, the study says, doing so would not only reduce the need for people to choose among bad options, but also improve their circumstances.
Siders pointed to Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, a town of about 500 that, after one too many floods, moved itself out of the flood plain. The community took that challenge and turned it into opportunity, reorienting the business district such that it could take advantage of highway traffic and powering it entirely with solar energy - and they did this in the 1970s.
The article not only stresses the viability of retreat but challenges the idea that retreat is based exclusively on geographical factors like elevation and proximity to the coast. “Retreat, in practice, depends at least as much on sort of social, economic, cultural geography,” Koslov said.
“It’s not that everywhere should retreat,” Siders said. “It’s that retreat should be an option. It should be a real viable option on the table that some places will need to use.”

Resumen: Chris Christie has announced 'The Christie Institute of Public Policy,' which will try to create civil discourse. Given his history, that's laughable.

Texto completo: For all of us concerned about the erasure of civility in this country, have no fear, because there’s a new super hero on the scene. A friend asked me the other day whether I could guess which politician is launching a civility initiative. Put that way, the sure fire answer had to be President Donald Trump. Wrong, he shouted. It’s Chris Christie! “Whoa, of course!” I replied, "That makes perfect sense. "
After all, Christie, the bombastic former governor of New Jersey, is certainly known for “bridging divides. ” Remember “Bridgegate” — when a member of his staff and several of his political appointees colluded to create traffic jams in New Jersey by closing lanes at the main toll plaza of the George Washington Bridge. He’s also known for a long history of name-calling and bullying, which — natch — makes him the right choice to lead The Christie Institute of Public Policy, in partnership with Seton Hall University School of Law.
(Two Seton Hall officials told the New Jersey Globe on Wednesday that the university was blindsided by Christie’s premature announcement, with details yet to be finalized. )
The Bridgegate controversy has stained him for the long term
The stain to Christie’s reputation from Bridgegate helped tank his bid for the 2016 Republican nomination for president, with the former governor even citing the scandal as “a factor” in why Donald Trump skipped over him as a candidate for veep (and every other job in his “drain the swamp” administration, which has included such “winners” as former Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta, who has resigned over his involvement in a 2007 plea deal for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, the subject of multiple ethics investigations and a possible Justice Department probe for using his office for personal gain; and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, who CNN reported “resigned after two ex-wives went public with allegations of past abuse, which he denied”).
Letter:Advice for ex-governor Christie: 'Sit down and shut up'
Let’s also be clear: Bridgegate was no one-off when it came to cementing Christie’s reputation as a bully and a boor. With news of the new institute, Twitter came roaring to life with flashbacks to many of the ex-governor’s best hits. Among those insults: “Take a bat to her,” in reference to state Sen. Loretta Weinberg in 2011, when she was 76. “Your rear end’s going to get thrown in jail, idiot,” to a former Navy SEAL. “Are you stupid? … I’m sorry for the idiot over there,” to a journalist. “Sit down and shut up,” to a protester asking the governor about the distribution of Hurricane Sandy aid. And — of course — “numb nuts” (to a gay New jersey lawmaker).
Fast-forward to last week and listen to Christie bemoan the current political landscape.
“Unfortunately, our politics have gotten so ugly and divisive in the country that people are not having civilized conversations,” he told NJ Advance Media, taking no responsibility for his role in helping to create this crisis in civility.
One local columnist voiced incredulity, writing, “Really? That's a big stretch coming from a governor who actively marketed his smash-mouth persona on YouTube and later became the staunch, stand-by-his-side defender of Donald Trump, the tweeter in chief who has plunged political discourse to new, toxic depths. ”
Even with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, Christie, who maintains a “close friendship” with Trump, defended the president who threw him under the bus.
“I think the negative tone in our politics existed long before Donald Trump,” he has been quoted as saying. “You’re never going to agree with anyone 100% of the time, and I have a lot of Democrat friends who are using a lot of language that is very hot. ”
If I may, Governor, let me remind you that civil discourse does not require people to agree with each other. That is actually un-American, a limit to our belief in free speech. It does, however, ask us to listen with open ears, and it does prohibit bullying and name-calling.
Last winter, I spoke with Carolyn Lukensmeyer, the former executive director of the nonprofit, nonpartisan National Institute for Civil Discourse. "Civility does not mean appeasement or avoiding important differences. It means listening and talking about those differences with respect," she told me.
Where to draw the line:I'm for civility, but what if our fellow citizens express contemptible views?
Yes, respect. In a healthy democracy, that’s just what we need. Nowhere in recent interviews with Christie does the word “respect” appear. That’s telling. But then, the governor’s past bad behavior really tells us all we need to know — that The Christie Institute of Public Policy is a poorly veiled attempt to rebrand New Jersey’s most bombastic governor as a leader who seeks “to bring people together, not drive them apart,” as he told NJ. com.
Seton Hall officials would be wise to put the kibosh on this partnership.
Cindy McCain taking steps in the right direction
Still, there’s some hope on the “civility” front. Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Republican senator, John McCain, used the one-year anniversary of his death this week to encourage Americans to be more civil.
“We’re missing John’s voice of reason right now in so many ways,” McCain told NPR, referencing her late husband’s friendships with Democrats like former Vice President Joe Biden and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. To honor her husband’s legacy, McCain said, "it felt to me that the right thing to do was to encourage people to perform acts of civility. "
In a YouTube video marking the anniversary, McCain urged people “to join together across the aisle — or whatever divides us — to make our world a better place. " She asked viewers to post about their experiences using #ActsofCivility. She said, "Agree to disagree, but just be civil about it. "
Now, that’s an initiative I can get behind.

Texto completo: A former business partner of President Trump's company was arrested last week on felony charges of stealing two pieces of luggage from the Memphis airport.
Dinesh Chawla and his brother were partners with the Trump Organization on multiple hotel projects in the Mississippi Delta until earlier this year.
Last year, The New York Times profiled Mr. Chawla, whose father, V. K. Chawla grew up in a refugee camp in Punjab, India, and started the family's hotel business about three decades ago after seeking the advice of Mr. Trump, then a New York real estate developer.
According to police records, airport security footage recorded Dinesh Chawla on Aug. 18 removing another passenger's suitcase from a baggage claim carousel and putting it in his car before taking a flight.
The airport police said they searched the car and discovered the suitcase and another piece of luggage that had been taken from the airport a month earlier. Mr. Chawla was arrested when he returned to Memphis on Thursday and that he admitted to stealing the two bags and their contents, valued at about $ 4,000, according to a police affidavit. The records also said Mr. Chawla had confessed to stealing other luggage "over a long period of time," but it provided no details of other thefts.
Mr. Chawla told an officer "that he knows stealing luggage is wrong, but he does it for the thrill and excitement," the records said.
The arrest, first reported by News Channel 3, a CBS affiliate in Memphis, resulted in two felony theft charges.
Mr. Chawla, who lives in Cleveland, Miss., declined to comment when reached by email.
The Chawlas had been developing properties that were to include the first of two new Trump hotel brands. In February, the Trumps shelved the new hotel lines, citing a difficult political climate, and amicably parted ways with the Chawlas.
In the months since, Mr. Chawla has continued construction on the biggest of the developments in Cleveland, which is to include a hotel, restaurants and entertainment. He told The Times earlier this summer that he was also working on other deals.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

From voodoo economics to evil-eye economics

Información de publicación: Bismarck Tribune ; Bismarck, ND [Bismarck, ND]. 25 Aug 2019: 8.

Texto completo: Almost four decades ago then-candidate George H.W. Bush used the phrase "voodoo economic policy" to describe Ronald Reagan's claim that cutting taxes for the rich would pay for itself. He was more prescient than he could have imagined.
For voodoo economics isn't just a doctrine based on magical thinking. It's the ultimate policy zombie, a belief that seemingly can't be killed by evidence. It has failed every time its proponents have tried to put it into practice, but it just keeps shambling along. In fact, at this point it has eaten the brains of every significant figure in the Republican Party. Even Susan Collins, the least right-wing GOP senator (although that isn't saying much), insisted that the 2017 tax cut would actually reduce the deficit.
During the 2016 campaign Donald Trump pretended to be different, claiming that he would actually raise taxes on the rich. Once in office, however, he immediately went full voodoo. In fact, he has taken magical thinking to a new level.
True, whenever tax cuts fail to produce the predicted miracle, their defenders come up with bizarre explanations for their failure.
My favorite until now came from Art Laffer, the original voodoo economist and recent recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Why did George W. Bush's tax-cutting presidency end not with a boom, but with the worst economic slump since the Great Depression? According to Laffer, blame rests with Barack Obama, even though the recession began more than a year before Obama took office. You see, according to Laffer, everyone lost confidence upon realizing that Obama might win the 2008 election.
But Trump has gone one better. As it has become increasingly clear that the results of his tax cut were disappointing - recent data revisions have marked down estimates of both GDP and employment growth, to the point where it's hard to see more than a brief sugar high from $2 trillion in borrowing - Trump has invented ever more creative ways to blame other people. In particular, he's now claiming that the promised boom hasn't arrived because his opponents are hexing the economy with bad thoughts: "The Democrats are trying to will' the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election."
Can opposition politicians really cause a recession with negative thinking? This goes beyond voodoo economics; maybe we should call it evil-eye economics.
To be fair, the claim that Democrats are hexing his boom is a secondary theme in Trump's ranting. Mostly he has been blaming the Federal Reserve for its "crazy" interest rate hikes. And the truth is that last year's rate increases pretty clearly were a mistake.
But blaming the Fed for the tax cut's fizzle won't wash. For one thing, the Fed has actually raised rates less than in previous economic recoveries. Even more to the point, the Trump economic team was expecting Fed rate hikes when it made its extravagantly optimistic forecasts. Administration projections from a year ago envisioned 2019 interest rates substantially higher than what we're actually seeing.
Put it this way: The Trump tax cut was supposed to create a boom so powerful that it would not only withstand modest Fed rate hikes, but actually require such hikes to prevent inflationary overheating. You don't get to turn around and claim betrayal when the Fed does exactly what you expected it to do.
Aside from blaming everyone but himself, however, how will Trump deal with the failure of his economic promises? He has taken to demanding that the Fed roll the printing presses, slashing interest rates and buying bonds - the actions it normally takes in the face of a serious recession - even as he claims that the economy remains strong, and unemployment is in fact near a historic low.
As many people have noted, these are exactly the actions Republicans, including Trump, denounced as "currency debasement" when unemployment was far higher than it is today and the economy desperately needed a boost.
Since the Fed is unlikely to oblige, what else might Trump do? Officials have floated, then retracted, the idea of a cut in payroll taxes - that is, a tax break for ordinary workers, rather than the corporations and wealthy individuals who mainly benefited from the 2017 tax cut. But such action seems unlikely, among other things because top administration officials denounced this policy idea when Obama proposed it.
Trump has also suggested using executive authority to reduce taxes on capital gains (which are overwhelmingly paid by the wealthy). This move would have the distinction of being both ineffectual and illegal.
What about calling off the trade war that has been depressing business investment? This seems unlikely, because protectionism is right up there with racism as a core Trump value. And merely postponing tariffs might not help, since it wouldn't resolve the uncertainty that may be the trade war's biggest cost.
The truth is that Trump doesn't have a Plan B, and probably can't come up with one. On the other hand, he might not have to. Who needs competent policy when you're the chosen one and the king of Israel?

McClain denies identity theft claim Astronaut accused of improperly accessing wife's bank account

Texto completo: A Spokane native and decorated NASA astronaut responded on Twitter Saturday to strongly deny allegations she committed identity theft by accessing her estranged wife's bank account while aboard the International Space Station.
The New York Times reported Friday that Anne McClain's spouse, Summer Worden, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission accusing McClain of identity theft for improperly viewing the account. Soon after Worden filed her complaint, Worden's family reportedly filed a second complaint with NASA's Office of Inspector General.
"There's unequivocally no truth to these claims," McClain wrote Saturday. "We've been going through a painful, personal separation that's now unfortunately in the media. I appreciate the outpouring of support and will reserve comment until after the investigation. I have total confidence in the IG process."
The couple's separation has reportedly involved a parenting dispute.
McClain went to court in 2018 seeking shared parenting rights and the sole right to designate the residence of Worden's son, who was born about a year before the two met, the Times reported. Later the same year, McClain reportedly accused Worden of assault. Those charges were dismissed.
Worden has not alleged that McClain moved or used the funds in the bank account she accessed, the Times reported. In sworn testimony to the inspector general, the Times reported that McClain did not deny that she accessed the account but told investigators she was acting with Worden's permission and was using a password she had previously used and was never told to stop using. She said she viewed the account to ensure her family's financial well-being in her absence.

Texto completo: "I blame David Letterman for this. His Top 10 lists were delicious late-night snacks."
Here are my five favorite things about this sentence: (1) It grabs your attention, (2) It keeps you guessing, (3) It's not overly wordy, (4) It's something you might forward to friends, (5) It's part of the list-making trend that just keeps growing.
The New York Times sent subscribers an email on Aug. 11 promoting "12 new books our editors liked" and "10 best new recipes." There was also a report on "the 50 best TV shows on Netflix right now." 50! That's quite a list. I expect a follow-up in which editors select "the 10 best TV shows on our list of Netflix's 50 best TV shows."
The very same day:
The Boston Globe continued its obsession with sports lists: "Eight takeaways from the Patriots' time in Michigan."
The Washington Post offered, "Eight non-culinary tools you can use in the kitchen." (Spoiler: one is a blow torch.)
The Chicago Tribune: "10 summer care tips for curly hair." Parade magazine: "20 songs Joni Mitchell Wrote About Men."
So, yes, it seems we're all drawn to lists. And, clearly, editors have figured that out.
The Internet's clickosphere contributes to it. Just Google "Top 10 Lists" and you'll be amazed. A few of my favorites: "Top 10 Researchers Who Experimented on Themselves" and "10 People Who Gained Genius from Brain Damage."
I blame David Letterman for this. His Top 10 lists were delicious late-night snacks, with entries such as: "Top 10 Things That Sound Cool When Said by Snoop Dogg."
Of course, Dave is now off in semi-retirement, trying desperately to come up with a list of 10 good reasons not to shave his beard, and undoubtedly laughing over the fact that editors can't resist his fun-with-lists gimmick.
There's an actual Wikipedia section titled "List of lists of lists." How detailed is it? It includes "List of Tamil films of the 1940s" and "Lists of 'Dungeons & Dragons' monsters."
Buzzfeed has popularized the term "listicle," which is any article in the form of a list — and Buzzfeed's listicles get millions of views!
So, my Top Five reasons for writing this: (5) I will presumably be paid, (4) It required little thinking, (3) It's summer, after all, (2) Readers love lists, and (1) It serves to remind us that lists, while sometimes engaging, should never be confused with actual writing.

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

Texto completo: Fifty years ago, Los Angeles was shocked by the horrific slaughter of actress Sharon Tate, then eight months pregnant, and four visitors to her Benedict Canyon estate. The next night, across town, two more people were murdered in their home: Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. At both houses, the victims were found stabbed to death, with variations of the word "pig" written in blood on the walls. When police identified the killers as a brainwashed "family" led by an ex-con named Charles Manson, the murders took on a mythical quality, becoming a source of perennial fascination. With the release of Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood" - which dramatizes the Manson Family's crimes with a grisly, revisionist twist - the misconceptions about the historic case may only multiply.
Myth No. 1 Manson, a serial killer, slayed the Tate-LaBianca victims. Fox News, the Guardian and HuffPost have all recently used the term "serial killer" to describe Manson. It's an easy mistake to make, since Manson's group murdered many people in rapid succession, and Manson himself is synonymous with those crimes.
But Manson wasn't even at the scene when his followers killed Tate and her visitors - Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent - on the night of Aug. 8, 1969. He was present at the LaBianca murders, but helped only by tying up the couple in their living room. After that, he left, ordering his followers to repeat the events of the previous night, but with less "mess."
Though Manson did not directly perform the killings, prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi won a conviction against him on seven counts of first-degree murder by arguing that he had ordered them. Manson was also convicted of two murders that he did physically participate in: of Gary Hinman, a musician and UCLA graduate student, and Donald "Shorty" Shea, a movie stuntman.
Myth No. 2 Manson was a hippie. When the Family was indicted on murder charges, the Los Angeles Times labeled the group a "hippie clan," and the tag has become an immutable part of the way we see them. In "Once Upon a Time . . . in Hollywood," the character played by Leonardo DiCaprio sneeringly dismisses the Manson girls as "hippies." And a new book on Manson, "Hippie Cult Leader," also suggests that he shared the movement's flower-power ethos.
But Manson and his ragged following were not hippies. To be sure, they fit the popular stereotype: The men grew their hair long and didn't shave; the women wore flowing peasant dresses and flowers in their hair; and drugs such as LSD, hash and marijuana were part of their daily lives. Manson borrowed some hippie lines about free love. But as he saw it, hippies were weak and ineffectual, and where they aimed to expand their consciousness, he wanted his followers "dead in the head." As an alternative, he adopted the term "slippies," derived from one of the group's signature practices: Late at night, they would slip in and out of the homes of wealthy families to rearrange their furniture and steal their personal belongings. They called this "creepy crawling," and it was hardly a way to make love and not war.
Myth No. 3 Manson obviously lacked musical talent. Prosecutor Bugliosi's best-selling book about the Manson case, "Helter Skelter," claims that Manson didn't have the chops to succeed as a musician, citing a "folk-song expert" who found Manson's songs "extremely derivative" and wrote him off as "a moderately talented amateur." Bugliosi used Manson's alleged lack of talent to fortify his motive for the murders: In this view, he wanted to lash out at the Hollywood music scene that had rejected him. The notion that Manson was a bad musician has percolated into more recent narratives about the murders; a Vox explainer from this month repeatedly calls him untalented.
In fact, many musicians in Hollywood who heard Manson's music thought he was a promising singer-songwriter. Neil Young, in his 2012 autobiography, "Waging Heavy Peace," described the songs as "off-the-cuff things he made up as he went along, and they were never the same twice in a row. Kind of like Dylan, but different because it was hard to glimpse a true message in them, but the songs were fascinating. He was quite good." The Beach Boys even recorded one of Manson's songs, "Cease to Exist," though they altered the music and retitled it "Never Learn Not to Love."
Myth No. 4 Manson was mentally ill. The cruelty and sadism of the Family have led many to conclude that Manson suffered from some mental illness. A Jezebel reporter, interviewing me about my book, wondered if the story was so complicated because Manson was "one of the most extraordinarily mentally ill people that the American public has ever been exposed to." A New York Times reporter put it more bluntly: "Manson was completely insane, right?" After studying historical footage for the role, actor Damon Herriman, who plays Manson in Tarantino's movie and in the new season of the TV series "Mindhunter," likened him to "someone with schizophrenia that you see talking to themselves on the street. . . . Clearly the guy was mentally ill."
In reality, though, Manson was never diagnosed with any illness. He refused to submit to a psychiatric evaluation at his 1970 trial for the Tate-LaBianca murders, and the psychiatrists and psychologists who examined him during his subsequent years in prison disagreed about whether he was faking. (One report from 1982 recommended that Manson be transferred out of the psychiatric ward, concluding that he was only "a psychiatric curiosity or oddity.")
Myth No. 5 Manson hoped to ignite a race war. As Bugliosi explained at trial and in his book - and as has been repeated in pretty much every news article , book or film about the case - Manson instructed his followers to kill everyone at the Tate and LaBianca homes and frame the Black Panthers. Manson's belief, Bugliosi contended, was that the subsequent police crackdown would spark an apocalyptic race war. Manson promised his followers he'd protect them in a bottomless pit in the desert, and then they'd reemerge to repopulate the planet with their perfect white offspring.
In the first book about the trial, "Witness to Evil," author George Bishop wrote that Bugliosi believed his race-war motive even "more than Manson" did. But that belief wasn't widely shared among Bugliosi's colleagues. Nearly a dozen cops and prosecutors involved with the original investigations told me that they thought the Tate and LaBianca murders were "copycat" crimes intended to spring a lesser Family member, Bobby Beausoleil, from jail: He was awaiting trial in the Gary Hinman murder, committed two weeks earlier, and the new killings may have been meant to sow doubts that authorities had captured the right man. Many of them said Bugliosi inflated a minor Family "philosophy" about a possible coming race war into Manson's central, personal motivation. "Did you ever hear of dramatic license?" Aaron Stovitz, Bugliosi's original co-prosecutor in the case, asked me. (Stovitz, for his part, says he never bought the race-war theory.)
Bugliosi himself made a startling admission in the last interview he gave before his death in 2015. " Did Manson himself believe all this ridiculous, preposterous stuff about all of them living in a bottomless pit in the desert while a worldwide war went on outside? I think, without knowing, that he did not," he told Rolling Stone. If not to start a race war, why did Manson order the killings? He died in prison in 2017, and we may never know the answer.

‘Free press’ has hatred for president

Información de publicación: Daily Herald ; Arlington Heights, Ill. [Arlington Heights, Ill]. 24 Aug 2019: 8.

Resumen: [...]a coup to oust a duly elected president is far worse. [...]the "free press" frees itself from its bond of hate, the threat to democracy remains. Short-term memory seems to be a common marker for dementia, Alzheimers and just old-age memory loss. Since doing crosswords, I know my short-term memory has improved tremendously. According to the 2018 American Express State of Women-Owned Business Report, there are approximately 12.3 million women-owned businesses nationwide, a major contrast to the approximately 402,000 nearly 50 years ago.

Texto completo: ‘Free press’ has hatred for president The Daily Herald opinion of Friday, Aug. 16, echoes the same theme of a year ago, namely President Donald Trump describes the "free press" as "enemies of the people." The theme has not changed, neither has the "free press" MSNBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, etc. These commentators, expert analysts, entertainers and talk show hosts harbor enormous hatred for Trump.
To shape public opinion, the press has called the president unspeakable names and accusations; mentally unfit to be president, collaborated with the enemy, become a dictator, etc. They lied, conjectured and manufactured false accusations. One "expert" analyst suggested treason. Treason is punishable by death. Outrageous.
For two years it was the Russia collusion hoax. The Mueller report ended that. Obstruction of justice, fizzled. Next came the perennial favorite smear: He is a racist. This baseless accusation is currently raging. All this time not one favorable comment about the president? Where is fairness, integrity and balance?
Tune in anytime to CNN or MSNBC for verification. In a nutshell that is the state of our "free press."
When the "free press" dedicated itself to remove from office our legitimately elected president, using slander and vicious lies, and turned on the very citizenry that it was constitutionally entrusted to protect against actual government abuse, it has indeed betrayed the public trust and has turned itself into "the enemy of the people." Period.
The Opinion is correct that such adversarial relationship between President Donald Trump and the "free press" is bad for democracy. But a coup to oust a duly elected president is far worse. That is treason. Until the "free press" frees itself from its bond of hate, the threat to democracy remains. An Opinion on the responsibility of the free press is much awaited.
Laszlo Stephan Elmhurst Asylum at home I have one question for the Democrats. Where do the tens of millions of people living in violence, fear and poverty in their cities, counties and states get to go and apply for asylum?
Tony Atkins Wheaton Try this ‘clump of cells’ test In his recent letter "Opponents of choice use religion, not fact," John Gleason opens with this: "It boggles the mind that writers like Michael Ellegood and other anti-choice fanatics continue to assign human qualities to what amounts to a clump of cells in a woman’s body." A bit further on, he informs us that, "Most of the legally terminated pregnancies are of embryos, not babies."
Clump of cells, John? That’s all you see? OK, then let’s test your thinking. Do a web search for the Decorah eagles. You’ll find a page that includes live-streaming video of an eagle’s nest there. Bookmark the page and go back there daily, beginning in, oh, say, late January of next year. Keep going to that page until you see that the nest contains an egg or two.
Then, drive to Decorah, climb the tree and take an egg. When you get back down on the ground, start up a little campfire and make yourself an omelette using that egg you just retrieved from the nest. Keep it warm, and then sit there and wait for the IDNR officers and/or other officials from the state/county.
Not to worry, however, as you can explain to them that the egg was not an eagle, but merely a "clump of cells" inside an eggshell. Just convince them that your meal does not involve an eagle, and in fact, is a mere embryo, and does not even have "eagle qualities."
If you manage to convince them, who knows? They might ask if they could join you for breakfast. If, as I suspect, you can’t convince them, you could well find yourself having some "quiet time" away from your home and family. If that should happen, write another letter and tell us all about how and why everything happened as it did.
John Babush Big Rock Crosswords are more than ‘just puzzles’ For years we’ve been reading our favorite health articles about how to enlarge our pecs, our abs, our delts and any other of the muscles that we are so proud of, but how about the systems that help those muscles function? The nervous system. Let’s fire up our neurons, axons, dendrites and synapses. How? I’m convinced that crossword puzzles are the best way to meet the cognitive challenges of memory, intelligence, memory loss, even Alzheimers.
Doing crosswords helps us to: read between the lines; think outside the box; be decisive; take chances; improve memory. Short-term memory seems to be a common marker for dementia, Alzheimers and just old-age memory loss. Since doing crosswords, I know my short-term memory has improved tremendously.
Crosswords were instrumental in saving a 7-year-old boy’s life. When in college, my summer job for two years was teaching swimming and lifeguarding for the Chicago Park District. One night, I locked the door to the pool and went to supper at a local restaurant. I always brought a crossword to do at the table. This time I forgot, so I hopped in the car and returned to the pool. As always, I took a quick scan of the pool. To my utter dismay, a body was at the bottom. I jumped in immediately and pulled one of my 7-year-olds to the deck. Luckily he was still gurgling and coughing up water, but was OK. It turned out the cleaning lady left the door between the girl’s and boy’s locker room open and he just had to take one more jump from the diving board, but panicked.
That story is probably why at the age of 91, I still start the day with a cup of coffee and a puzzle.
Ed Berge Rolling Meadows Advances for women, but more to be done August 26, Women’s Equality Day, marks the 99th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment — the day women were given the Constitutional right to vote.
In the last 99 years, women have made remarkable strides, especially in the world of politics and business. In 2018, America elected 117 new women to the U.S. House or Senate, a record number, bringing the total number of women in Congress to 127 and 25 in the Senate. Plus, nine women were elected governor in 2018. As we look to the presidential election, six women are viable candidates.
The same can be said for women business owners and entrepreneurs. According to the 2018 American Express State of Women-Owned Business Report, there are approximately 12.3 million women-owned businesses nationwide, a major contrast to the approximately 402,000 nearly 50 years ago. The Women’s Business Development Center, with offices throughout the Midwest, including Chicago, is proud to be part of that success.
When we began in 1986, roughly 1 in 4 privately held businesses were owned by women. Today we serve several thousand woman-owned businesses in our nine-state region. Despite this progress, there is still more work to be done such as equal pay for women and men. Access to capital for women-owned businesses and programs and networking opportunities for women to continue to grow and move ahead.
So, this Women’s Equality Day, we celebrate the past and look forward to a future of great things for women. Let’s all strive to do more in the next 365 days to continue moving women ahead as we march forward to the 100th anniversary next year.

Texto completo: Sedona, Ariz. • As a government official in World War II, Hamilton Warren was outraged to learn that a black colleague made half as much as his white peers. So, after the war, the wealthy Harvard graduate and his wife, Barbara, pitched up a tent in a remote corner of northern Arizona. Working together with the Hopi people, they built a school open to every race, creed, orientation and nationality, and dedicated to values of environmental stewardship, physical labor and cultural understanding.
Verde Valley School was and remains among the most genuinely progressive boarding schools anywhere. It is surely the most American. Instead of aping the Etonian traditions of the Old World, it created something different for the New. It believed in an identity that was forged, not just inherited; in the possibility of transcending differences, not reinforcing them; in making a break from the past, not remaining fixated by it.
So it is with so much in the United States, which makes it so different from nearly everywhere else. When Hernán Cortés and his men landed on the coast of Mexico, in 1519, they encountered a world of utter barbarity: incessant warfare, endemic slavery and human sacrifice on an immense scale. They, in turn, inflicted their own barbarities: massacres, epidemics, forced labor and religious intolerance.
Whether one barbarity was better than the other is not a particularly interesting debate. The conquest of Mexico was another chapter of history as it usually is, a contest for power with little hope for progress.
The Conquistadors and their successors also imported millions of African slaves. Seen in the overall context of the Western Hemisphere — or, for that matter, most of the pre-modern world — the arrival of more than 20 slaves in Virginia a century later was abominable but not unique.
Yet something else came to America: the idea of liberty. Unlike the taste for plunder, which is nearly universal, the idea of liberty isn’t. It emerges from a distinctive intellectual tradition that, within a limited sphere, emphasized the claims of individual conscience, a disintermediated relationship with God and a skeptical view of state power.
It also emerged from a unique historical circumstance. Cortés was a soldier acting in the name of the Spanish crown and the Catholic Church. Among those who came to North America, many were religious dissenters and political refugees, starting with the Huguenots in Canada and the Mayflower Pilgrims. They could be tyrants and bigots, violent and superstitious. But they also saw themselves, if sometimes self-servingly, as nonconformists and victims of political persecution.
It was this self-conception that encouraged successive generations of religious dissenters, movement starters and freethinkers to go their own way. As importantly, it also made it untenable, over the long haul, for those in positions of authority to oppose them. This is the thought that I’d like to contribute to The New York Times’ 1619 Project.
Elsewhere in the world — Spain in the 17th century, China today — the argument against liberty has mainly been an argument for tradition, hierarchy and order. In America, the argument against liberty has been the argument of hypocrites. To deny freedom to others inevitably means subverting the principle through which one can claim freedom for oneself.
That’s why every significant liberation movement in the U.S., from abolition to suffrage to civil rights to marriage equality, has made its case by appealing to foundational principles, not rejecting them.
“The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham,” Frederick Douglass reproached a Rochester, New York, audience July 5, 1852. But he also said, in the same speech, that “interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a glorious liberty document.” Martin Luther King Jr. made essentially the same case 111 years later from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
This has always been one of the astonishments of America: The origin story of the ruling class does more to undermine than bolster its claims to power. Take that origin story away — the one that traces a line from Mayflower Compact to the Declaration of Independence to the Battle of Gettysburg to the Freedom Riders — and you lose this.
Past generations of oppressed Americans have bested their oppressors by appealing to their conscience and self-interest. But if a new origin story were to tell us that our ideals have always been a sham (as opposed to being honored too much in the breach) and that the whole story of America is one of unremitting oppression (as opposed to the far-too-gradual relief of oppression), then we would lose the mechanism of self-reproach by which past progress was made.
At that point, the only thing for people with power to do would be to hold on to it. Why should anyone bother to measure his behavior according to standards nobody expects him to hold?
This is a beautiful country, especially amid red rocks under vast skies. But as people like Hamilton Warren knew, the real beauty of America has less to do with the outer vistas than the inner ones — the ever-renewing possibility of being “more perfect” according to ideals that remain our starting point and destination.

Rules revision would cut public input

Texto completo: Addison Independent
If a proposed change in federal land use rules goes through, the Green Mountain National Forest could see a lot more commercial logging, road building and utility corridors — all without environmental review or public input.
“Basically, the rules would take the ‘public’ out of public land management,” said Jamey Fidel, Forest and Wildlife Program Director for the Vermont Natural Resources Council (VNRC).
At issue is a proposal by the United States Forest Service (USFS) to revise the way it interprets the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which is the foundation of environmental policy making in the United States. It requires agencies like the USFS to analyze the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.
The USFS proposal would drastically alter the way it handles those requirements by greatly expanding the number and type of projects that would count as “categorical exclusions,” which can be approved without environmental assessments or impact statements.
Projects the USFS would reclassify as “categorical exclusions” include:
Commercial logging, including clear cutting, on areas up to 4,200 acres at a time.
Building new roads through the forest up to 5 miles at a time.
Reconstructing old roads through the forest up to 10 miles a time.
Bulldozing up to 4 miles of pipeline and utility rights-of-way through the forest.
Closing roads and trails used for recreational purposes.
Adding illegally built roads and trails to the official USFS road and trail system.
New rules also would allow the USFS to bypass public input on nearly every project decision. According to estimates from a number of forestry and environmental organizations, the proposal would eliminate public and environmental review from more than 90 percent of all USFS projects.
The Forest Service said it needs to do this because, among other things, the agency has a backlog of “special use permits or renewals” that “are awaiting environmental analysis and decision affecting more than 7,000 businesses and 120,000 jobs.”
In addition, such challenges as the recent increase in wildfires are taking up more and more of the agency’s resources and personnel.
What the USFS does not mention, however, is that according to the Congressional Research Service, the Trump administration has proposed cutting Forest Service spending by nearly $1 billion for fiscal year 2020, including a $654.4 million cut in Wildland Fire Management.
“This (proposed change to NEPA) is happening at a time when the Forest Service is slashing its own budget, and lacks the resources to evaluate what it’s doing,” wrote Sam Evans in The New York Times.
Evans, who works in the Southern Appalachian national forests, went on to call the USFS proposal “an attack on the very idea” of public lands.
“If the Forest Service has its way, visitors won’t know what’s coming until logging trucks show up at their favorite trailheads or a path for a gas pipeline is cleared below a scenic vista,” Evans wrote.
The USFS insists that the changes “meet both the spirit and intention of the NEPA,” but critics see the recent proposal as part of a larger trend.
Last December, after revoking permits that would have allowed the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to build through parts of the George Washington and Monongahela national forests, as well as across the Appalachian Trail, the 4th U.S. Circuit of Appeals rebuked the Forest Service for granting permits that violated both the National Forest Management Act and NEPA.
The three-judge panel concluded that the agency had “abdicated its responsibility to preserve national forest resources.” Of particular note was the way the Forest Service’s “environmental concerns … were suddenly, and mysteriously, assuaged in time to meet a private pipeline company’s deadlines.”
In the Green Mountains
In Vermont, recent USFS projects in the Green Mountain National Forest (GMNF) have sparked concern among a number of environmental organizations, including the VNRC.
“In the past, when the Forest Service has undertaken major projects on the GMNF there has been ample opportunity (in accordance with the NEPA) for public comment and involvement,” wrote VNRC officials in a May 3 blog post. “VNRC has participated in these opportunities and we have enjoyed a collaborative relationship with the GMNF.”
But starting in the second half of 2018, the USFS began limiting public comment on projects — one to conduct even-aged timber harvesting on 15,000 acres in the southern half of the forest, and another that would require dozens of miles of new roads to implement 9,630 acres of timber harvesting.
Altogether, according to the VNRC, “the Forest Service is planning to construct 84 miles of road (57 miles of new and temporary roads and 26.7 miles of reconstructed roads over the next 15 years) with no opportunity for public comment on the environmental impacts of these activities.”
The Green Mountain National Forest is one of only two national forests in New England. It was established in 1932 in response to excess logging, fire and flooding. As of 2011, the GMNF covered 821,040 acres, nearly half of which was federally owned.
The Addison Independent was unable to reach GMNF officials for comment.
The White Mountain National Forest was established in 1918, in response to unregulated logging activities that resulted in forest fires and caused damage to watersheds that were important to industries that relied on water to operate mills, according to the forest’s website. It includes almost 800,000 acres in both New Hampshire and Maine.
The Valley News was unable to reach White Mountain National Forest officials for comment on Friday.
Heather Clish, the director of conservation and recreation policy for the Boston-based Appalachian Mountain Club, said her organization is submitting comments to the Forest Service, urging them to reconsider what see described as “arbitrary” acreage thresholds for the categorical exclusions.
In the White Mountain National Forest, most if not all typical forest management projects would come under a categorical exclusion, she said.
It’s “difficult to believe that all forest management should be exempt from review,” she said.
Supporters of public and environmental review see the proposed NEPA changes as an attempt by the Trump administration to codify the Forest Service’s recent practices.
And many of them are fighting back.
Organizations ranging from the National Audubon Society to the Sierra Club to the National Parks Conservation Association are urging concerned citizens to submit a public comment on the proposed rule changes.
The deadline for commenting is Monday.
“Please make your comments specific and unique to your concerns and relate your comments to a particular national forest, like the Green Mountain National Forest,” wrote VNRC officials on July 25. “The Forest Service will lump together (similar comments) and count them as one comment, so please make your comments unique to be counted.”
According to the Forest Service website, comments may be submitted:

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- In a party that overwhelmingly supports President Donald Trump, a few naysayers are popping up, raising the prospect that Trump could face more opposition from within his own party as he seeks re-election to a second term in 2020.
However, unseating Trump will be no easy feat. The president has the power of incumbency, with nearly 8 in 10 Republicans approving of Trump’s overall job performance in a recent poll, and Trump has brought in $57 million in the second quarter of this year alone, excluding money donated to the Republican National Committee.
But, there are a few Republicans who don't seem to be passengers on the Trump train.
Trump is already facing one official challenger in the GOP primary. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld announced his White House bid in April. Weld ran as Gary Johnson’s running mate on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016.
Joe Walsh, a one-term tea party-backed GOP congressman from Illinois turned conservative radio host, said Thursday during an interview on CNN that he is considering a 2020 primary challenge to Trump.
“I’m strongly, strongly considering it. That’s — again, I’m not trying to be cute or coy,” Walsh said. “I’ve told you before — if somebody’s going to get in there and go after him … it’s got to be done soon. ”
In a New York Times op-ed last week, Walsh wrote, “I didn’t vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 because I liked him. I voted for him because he wasn’t Hillary Clinton. ”
William Kristol, a prominent conservative and “Never Trump” Republican, is encouraging Walsh to run. Kristol is the former editor of the now-defunct conservative magazine The Weekly Standard.
Walsh has been publicly critical of Trump, including the president's fiscal decision-making and racial rhetoric. Walsh also called the 2018 Russia–United States summit in Helsinki “un-American” after Trump publicly seemed to side with Vladimir Putin over the U. S. intelligence community regarding Russia's interference in the 2016 election.
"In Mr. Trump, I see the worst and ugliest iteration of views I expressed for the better part of a decade. To be sure, I’ve had my share of controversy. " Walsh wrote in the op-ed. "On more than one occasion, I questioned Mr. Obama’s truthfulness about his religion. At times, I expressed hate for my political opponents. We now see where this can lead. There’s no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them.
"The fact is, Mr. Trump is a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base and advance his electoral prospects," he also wrote.
Additionally, George Conway, a vocal Trump critic and husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, tweeted his support for a possible Walsh run.
Walsh’s public talk about a possible White House run comes after former Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S. C. , appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday and said he is considering a primary challenge to Trump.
“There’s been a drumbeat over the last year of people who I admire, who are not crazy, who are very thoughtful saying we need to have this conversation,” Sanford, who is also a former governor of South Carolina, said.
More: Former South Carolina governor says Trump doesn't deserve re-election, is considering GOP primary challenge
Both Walsh and Sanford have said they intend to make a decision about challenging Trump by Labor Day.
Additionally, the Washington Post reports that Jeff Flake, a former Arizona senator and another "never-Trumper," said he has taken numerous recruitment calls in recent days from GOP donors rattled by looming signs of economic turbulence and who are eager for an alternative to Trump.
Flake has also said that it is better for a Democrat to win in 2020 that Trump, declaring, "Four years is difficult enough to unravel some of the damage" caused by the Trump administration, Flake said in March.
"Yes . . . and this notion, this narrative that's been built up, that Donald Trump is the only one that can cobble together the Electoral College and win is just a fallacy," Flake also said in March.
More: Cindy McCain says there is no 'voice of reason' in GOP, nearly a year after John McCain's death
And the prospect for a fifth GOP primary challenger to Trump has cropped up. Former Ohio governor John Kasich will head to New Hampshire next month to “take a look at things” after experiencing “an increase” in overtures this summer, an adviser said. The Washington Post first reported Kasich's upcoming trip.
Speculation about the prospect of one or more new GOP primary challengers to Trump comes after weeks of very public criticism of the president by Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director who recently withdrew his support for Trump. Instead, Scaramucci has declared Trump “unstable” and unfit for office.
He revealed he is in the process of forming a super PAC to run advertisements against his former boss.
More: Scaramucci says he will start and fund a super PAC to 'dismantle' Trump
Scaramucci called his past support for Trump a mistake and is seeking to take action in the political arena against the president. He also ridiculed against Trump on Twitter, comparing the president to the Game of Throne's Night King and calling Trump a "bully. "
The view that Trump is a bully who must be removed from the political scene by someone on the conservative side of the political spectrum is one shared by Walsh ho wrote as much in his New York Times op-ed.
“We need someone who could stand up, look the president in the eye and say: 'Enough, sir,'" Walsh penned. "'We’ve had enough of your indecency. We’ve had enough of your lies, your bullying, your cruelty, enough of your insults, your daily drama, your incitement, enough of the danger you place this country in every single day. We don’t want any of this anymore, and the country certainly can’t stand four more years of it. '”

Texto completo: News Corp is developing a news-aggregation service meant to address concerns that Alphabet Inc.'s Google News and other digital platforms don't reward publishers' work adequately and play down articles from certain types of sites, according to people familiar with the plans.
The service, currently called Knewz.com, is expected to be a website and a mobile app. An early version is being shown to a small group of News Corp executives, and an official launch could come later this year, though no specific timeline has been set, the people said. The company could still decide not to proceed with the project, they said.
The service will draw from hundreds of news sources, including national outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post and NBC News as well as digital-native players, magazine publishers and local newspapers, the people said. News Corp owns Dow Jones & Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal.
The articles on Knewz.com will link directly to publishers' sites, and News Corp won't take a cut of the advertising revenue the articles generate. News Corp also expects to share data with those publishers. The service will aim to promote original news reports rather than those that are quick rehashes of existing articles, and it will treat subscription news sites the same as nonsubscription sites in determining which articles to link to, the people familiar with the plans said.
News Corp isn't striking licensing deals with media companies for the service, since it is simply linking out to their sites without hosting their content on its platform or charging for it, one of the people said.
The project aims to give exposure to smaller outlets that News Corp executives believe are often demoted in Google's search results and Facebook Inc.'s social feed, the people said. That includes publishers with conservative audiences such as the Daily Wire, Daily Caller, Washington Free Beacon and Washington Examiner, according to some of the people.
Representatives for Google and Facebook had no comment. The companies have said their algorithms don't rank or prioritize content based on the political leanings of news organizations.

TRUMP'S INEVITABLE CAVE ON GUN CONTROL DESPITE MASS SHOOTINGS, THE PRESIDENT WILL LIKELY DO THE NRA'S BIDDING

Texto completo: If President Donald Trump were to respond to the recent mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio - which claimed 31 lives - with a serious, sustained push for expanded gun background checks, it really might bolster his reelection chances.
After all, such a push would probably appeal to voters he needs to win back, having badly alienated them with his malevolence and depravity - suburban and college-educated white voters, particularly women and possibly blue-collar white women who are moving away from Mr. Trump as well.
But multiple new reports are confirming that Mr. Trump - after suggesting in the wake of the carnage in Texas and Ohio that it is time to expand background checks - is again likely to abandon the idea under pressure from conservatives and the National Rifle Association.
Publicly, White House officials insist that some sort of gun-reform package is in the works. But it will almost surely consist mainly of less ambitious measures focused on mental health that Republicans can accept.
There was a time when you could squint at Mr. Trump and believe he might just defy his party on such matters. Mr. Trump vowed in 2016 to tax financial elites, excoriated his party for being willing to let people without health care die and seemed to support massive public spending to rebuild the country.
In other words, Mr. Trump would not govern as a small-government conservative ideologue and would be open to negotiated bipartisan government solutions on big issues facing the country.
Sure, Mr. Trump did mouth the usual platitudes about the Second Amendment. But expanded background checks is something that can be done without running afoul of it, and you could have imagined Mr. Trump taking this issue on, if he chose to.
But since then, a pattern has asserted itself. Mr. Trump rarely bucks GOP orthodoxy
Mr. Trump has turned over much of his domestic agenda to the congressional GOP and the cast of plutocrats and right-wing ideologues inside the White House, going all in on the failed Obamacare repeal, the massive corporate tax cut and the rampant deregulation spree.
Yes, Mr. Trump has defied GOP orthodoxy on trade, which is sometimes depicted as displaying an economic populism at odds with his party. But in truth, his trade agenda is largely driven by his xenophobic nationalism: It allows him to bluster about China and globalist elites and treat relations with other nations as zero-sum struggles for dominance. The true economic rationale behind Mr. Trump's trade agenda is often hard to discern.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has also defied some in his party by vetoing bipartisan congressional responses to Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And Mr. Trump's laxity towards Russia has at times put him in conflict with Republicans.
In short, to the degree that Mr. Trump has been at odds with his own party (and in many cases, Republicans have ultimately let him set the agenda), it has usually been in areas where his very worst instincts - his nationalism and his alliances with strongmen and other authoritarians - have run rampant.
A real push on guns could appeal to those voters, but not just because they might generally support combating gun violence. As Democratic strategist Bruce Gyory points out, the confluence of Mr. Trump's conspicuous public racism (his attacks on nonwhite lawmakers) along with the mass shootings might convince the middle of the country that Mr. Trump has become a meaningful threat to public safety and civil peace.
If so, Mr. Gyory notes, Mr. Trump's base likely will not be enough to save him, even given his structural Electoral College edge. Acting on guns might help mitigate this developing picture of Mr. Trump.
But Mr. Trump appears to see the costs of acting as more prohibitive. As The New York Times reports, Mr. Trump's move toward backing down suggests he's "capitulating to the views of his populist white and working-class political base" after the NRA "flooded" the White House and Congress with "phone calls."
It's not clear that the "populist" components of Mr. Trump's base are deeply preoccupied with expansive interpretations of gun rights. But the Trump base and the more traditional GOP base are often hard to disentangle.
At any rate, if Mr. Trump can be convinced by cynical operators that acting will put his base is at risk, which often seems easy to do, that might prove decisive. And the NRA spent massively on Mr. Trump's reelection, so unbridled self-interest could also do the trick.
All of which may yet again preclude any serious effort to appeal to the rest of the country.

Having hits can be overrated. For evidence, look no further than Squeeze, the New Wave veterans behind gems such as “Black Coffee in Bed," “Goodbye Girl," “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)," and the soulfully self-flagellating “Tempted," not one of which cracked the Top 40. In fact, outside of 1987's “Hourglass" and 1988's “853-5937," the British band (which barnstorms the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset on Sunday, the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis on Tuesday, and the Tanglewood Koussevitzky Music Shed in Lenox on Thursday) didn't actually have many substantial hits in the US. “No, we did not, no," says singer-guitarist Glenn Tilbrook with a laugh. “I thought ['Tempted'] was a hit, but then it wasn't. We ignored it for a while after that."
But Squeeze's catalog has managed to have a rather long tail, and most of its (many) best-of collections play like one shadow classic after another. “Yeah, that's the wonderful thing about those compilations, is that they got our songs out in a way that probably radio didn't, mostly," Tilbrook says. And if that was frustrating in the short term, the singer — whose longtime songwriting partnership with guitarist Chris Difford remains at the core of an ever-shifting lineup that's been stable since 2007, give or take a bassist or two — feels different about it now.
“That's in the past, and that's the way it happened. From where I am now, we have a body of work, most of which I'm extremely proud of. And we were lucky to have so many songs, from where selecting songs for this tour was really hard, to know what to do and what to leave out. So that's a great position to be in."
Q. Squeeze has enough albums that a lot of your songs have obviously fallen off of your concert setlists over the years. What's your relationship with those songs? You obviously thought highly enough of them at the time to put care into recording them and releasing them to the public.
A. Yeah. Well, you know, the thing about Squeeze and being on a major label is that most of the early records were how we wanted to make them. And then the further along you get in your career, the harder it is to maintain control, because as soon as you're deemed to be not successful, everyone has an idea of how to fix it. So you find yourself going out on a limb more. So for instance, I've often said “Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti" is my least favorite Squeeze album, but on this tour, we've gone back to that record and the original intention. There's a song called “King George Street," which actually I wrote as a sort of Fleetwood Mac-y type song. It was beautiful and simple, and we contrived in production and recording to make it the most complicated thing ever. And you listen to the record and it just sounds ugly to me. But we uncovered the song beneath it, and it's one of the highlights of the new set we have now, I think.
Q. Part of the genius of “Tempted" is in how there's very little agony expressed or even backstory given to the situation. Instead, it's just an accumulation of mundane details that still paint a picture of self-recrimination.
A. Yeah. It took me about a week to write the tune, actually. It was really hard to get it to sound easy. But it just felt like we'd created a milestone for ourselves. But then we couldn't record it properly. We made a disastrous first recording of it. Then [singer-keyboardist] Paul Carrack came along, and we did the version that we did, and it was just like, “Oh, yeah. [Chuckles] That's how it's supposed to be."
Q. What was disastrous about that first recording?
A. We did more like ELO, and I sang it. I don't know if it's still on any streaming platforms, but it's on a compilation album called “Excess Moderation," and you can hear it. And thank goodness that wasn't the version that came out.
Q. Back in 2010, Squeeze recorded exact replicas of some of your classics for an album called “Spot the Difference." How many of your fans took that as a challenge?
A. None as far as I know. [Laughs] That was a strange album to do, to go back and try and examine and remember not only what you did, how you sang, what amps you used, but how some members of the band who weren't there played and what they did, too. So it drove me a bit mad doing that. It was the sort of project I had to pick up and put down and go away from every now and then. But when we actually tied it up, I was really, really pleased, because most of the time, I think we got pretty close to the [original] records. And [there were] times where, like on “Black Coffee in Bed," that's my favorite version. It's better than the record, as far as I'm concerned. I know that people love the record, and I get that, but that was the record that we should've made. [Laughs]
Q. Why did you like that version better?
A. I could sing it better. My enthusiasm excelled my ability to sing in the way that I wanted to at that point. Maybe that was endearing, and I just hear all the stuff that I didn't get quite right. However, I got it right on the “Spot the Difference" version. And I tell you what, one thing that I was really proud of, I've got to tell you this story, is that “Black Coffee in Bed" came on somewhere that I was, and I just thought, “Oh, that's 'Black Coffee.' " And only about halfway through did I realize that it was the “Spot the Difference" version. [Laughs] Which is the ultimate compliment, that I managed to fool myself.
Q. You're not the only band to have embarked on such a project in recent years. Def Leppard and Cracker have also done similar exact-replica rerecordings. What do you think that it says about the recording industry?
A. I don't know what it says about the recording industry. I can tell you what it says about where we are, that of course like 90 percent of other bands that have had deals, we don't have any control over our catalog. The parts of our catalog that have ended up with Universal, we have been unable to ascertain up until now where our masters are and if they survived the fire. [In June, The New York Times Magazine ran a story on a massive, unreported 2008 vault fire at Universal Studios Hollywood estimated to have destroyed hundreds of thousands of original master recordings.] So that's a huge wodge of our work to basically not control, that's the point about it. Nor reap the benefits from it. So it was a small attempt to wrestle back some control while we still can. And I have to say, it was a successful audio adventure that, up until now, we've had zero profits from how we intended it to be, because no one's used it. [Chuckles]

'Crappy Jew Year': New York Times editor apologizes for 'offensive' tweets

Texto completo: Tom Wright-Piersanti has apologized for several "offensive" tweets from a decade ago that have since been deleted.
The New York Times politics editor tweeted the apology on Thursday after messages he posted between 2008-2010 resurfaced.
"I have deleted tweets from a decade ago that are offensive. I am deeply sorry," Wright-Piersanti said.
Tweet
Wright-Piersanti was apparently referring to at least one tweet from 2010, in which he wished people a "HAPPY Jew Year."
“I was going to say 'Crappy Jew Year,' but one of my resolutions is to be less anti-Semitic. So… HAPPY Jew Year. You Jews," says one now-deleted tweet from 2010.

Other tweets began circulating that many allege also contain offensive and racist statements. Some of these tweets are still live as of this writing.
TweetTweetTweet
"We are aware of these tweets, which are a clear violation of our standards. We are reviewing next steps," New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha told the Washington Examiner in a statement.
The fallout over Wright-Piersanti's old tweets comes after the New York Times demoted former deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman for "serious lapses in judgment" in sending recent tweets.
"Jonathan Weisman met with [New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet] today and apologized for his recent serious lapses in judgment. As a consequence of his actions, he has been demoted and will no longer be overseeing the team that covers Congress or be active on social media. We don't typically discuss personnel matters but we're doing so in this instance with Jonathan's knowledge," a representative of the paper said in an Aug. 13 statement.
In August 2018, the New York Times' Sarah Jeong was caught in a similar situation to Wright-Piersanti. Jeong, newly hired by the New York Times, was found to have tweeted such messages as "Dumbass f---ing white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants" as recent as 2014.
The New York Times took no action against Jeong, saying that she was "imitating the rhetoric of her harassers." The paper added that it does not condone Jeong's old tweets.

Texto completo: Who would have thought the 400th anniversary of slavery in America was worth celebrating? But then “celebrating” may not be the right word for what is turning into a reexamination of America's original sin.
USA TODAY and The New York Times are among the publications undertaking this effort. The USA TODAY project focuses in part on a family that came to be known as the Tuckers, “the founding family you’ve never heard of,” whose antecedents apparently were among those who landed in August 1619 at Point Comfort, Virginia. The Times has taken the anniversary as an occasion to “reframe the country’s history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black America at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are. ”
Treason made Civil War necessary
A number of conservatives have responded with indignation to this approach. Most prominent is former professional historian and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is apparently fed up with the focus on mistreatment of Africans.
“Certainly if you're an African American, slavery is at the center of what you see as the American experience. But for most Americans, most of the time, there were a lot of other things going on,” he explained. Instead of emphasizing the critical role played by race-based slavery, Gingrich argues that we should focus on the “several hundred thousand white Americans who died in the Civil War in order to free the slaves. "
400 years after American slavery:
Aaron Burr's lawyer owned my family. It has been a long, tragic journey from slavery.
Enslaved Africans landed in Virginia in 1619. USA TODAY is committed to telling the story, past and present
Gingrich’s argument is nonsensical. Whatever one’s race, “there were a lot of other things going on” at any period in history. One does not have to be black to see the importance of slavery to the American story. Nor does the fact that a lot of other things were “going on” make slavery inconsequential or somehow benign.
But then, despite comparing himself to scholar-president Woodrow Wilson, Gingrich is not a deep thinker. As historian Jonathan Zimmerman has pointed out, “to Gingrich, history is politics by any other means. ”
Also, Gingrich’s understanding of the Civil War is flawed. The goal of the war was not primarily to free black slaves but to block Southern secession and the expansion of slavery into the Western territories. But even if one accepts Gingrich’s framing, the logical focus would not just be on the selfless whites who died supposedly freeing slaves but on the millions of whites whose treason made the war necessary. Their rebellion against the U. S. government initiated the bloodiest conflict in American history, causing 620,000 deaths in an ultimately futile effort to preserve and expand a cruel and immoral institution.
White supremacy shaped America
One can argue over how different America might have been had the country never embraced white supremacy and race-based slavery, but one cannot argue, in any intellectually honest way, that this history has not fundamentally shaped who we are today. The nation’s first naturalization act — passed in 1790 — restricted eligibility to “free white persons. ”
That restriction stood until after the Civil War. Racial restrictions on immigration were not fully dropped until the latter part of the the 20th century. Although black Americans won the right to citizenship in the wake of the Civil War, the right to equality was not granted until a century later. And even then, most blacks were not allowed to exercise that supposed right.
To erase racial exclusion and suppression from America’s history is to erase most of American history.
Gingrich, for all his anti-intellectual bluster, surely understands that. But he simply finds it easier to celebrate the greatness in our history rather than focus on moral failings —especially if acknowledgement of those failings bolsters an argument to make amends.
Don't pretend the past doesn't matter
Over the course of my career, I have produced several books and hundreds of articles that attempt to explain America’s racial complexity. As a consequence, I have received thousands of nasty messages from white readers who insist that whites are not responsible for the mess minorities have made of their lives. I am very familiar with the way Gingrich frames things and with the tendency of so many thinkers, particularly on the right, to dismiss the pernicious effect of race — both historically and today.
More from the 1619 project:
Hundreds of thousands of Africans were enslaved in America. Wanda Tucker believes her relatives were the first
Slavery's explosive growth, in charts: How '20 and odd' became millions
Searching for answers: Wanda Tucker's spiritual journey to where the slave trade began
I am also aware that in the past few years, we have hit new lows in political rhetoric. Our current atmosphere is not one that encourages deep reflection or fosters the ability to digest a complex history. Still, I can’t help feeling that in an age where white supremacists with guns feel newly empowered, we have a responsibility to understand just what they are connecting to in our collective history.
We certainly can disagree about how much and in what ways the sins of our historical past influence the present. What we cannot do, with any integrity, is pretend that the past does not matter — or that it no longer influences who we are.

Texto completo: When Chris Marshall decided to stop drinking for good at 23, he realized there was something missing for people like him. Where could sober people gather on a weekend night, in a social setting that didn’t rely on alcohol?
In Austin, that’s hard to come by. Or, at least, it was, until Marshall opened Sans Bar in East Austin. Sans touts itself as the city’s first alcohol-free bar.
“I think that it’s so appropriate that Sans Bar started in Austin, which has kind of a reputation for being the city where every other city comes to party,” Marshall said. “We’re not prohibitionists. We’re just offering an alternative and saying, ‘Maybe you can have the same experience of fun and connection and dating and all of that, but without alcohol.’”
Now in his mid-30s, Marshall has made a living out of sober bartending, both at Sans and beyond the walls of the 2,000-square-foot bar at 1818 E. 12th St. He has figured out how to adapt classic cocktails into drinks that taste just as good sans the booze — such as the rosemary and ginger mule — with ginger beer, lime and rosemary simple syrup — but “mocktails” like that aren’t the sole focus of Sans.
Instead, Marshall hopes he’s created a place where real connection is the priority. On Friday nights, the softly lit bar brings in live music, comedy and drag shows. There is plenty of seating, including couches and tables, for people to sit and talk. A large outdoor space has room for food trucks.
Marshall wants to make one thing clear: Sans Bar isn’t just for people who abstain from alcohol, whether because they’re in recovery or for another reason. He said it can be for anyone who is exploring their relationship with alcohol. In other
words, someone who is “sober curious” — a term coined by journalist Ruby Warrington, who wrote a 2018 book of the same name — is also welcome.
“She examines what it means to be curious about the idea of drinking, taking away the idea that it’s a black or white decision, an either/or, either you drink or you don’t,” Marshall said.
People who are sober curious might still be drinking alcohol. Maybe they take off a month for dry July or sober October, Marshall said, or just have a cocktail when they’re out with friends on weekends. The role that booze plays in our lives is different for everyone. That’s where Sans Bar comes in, as a spot where “we give people the place to examine those definitions and challenge themselves to stay sober for the night.”
Marshall aims to make that challenge as easy as possible, but he does recognize the allure of alcohol in social situations. Before he went to rehab in 2007, he would turn to it as a way to make friends. Without booze, Sans Bar relies on other ways for people to have fun.
“I feel like part of what alcohol does is remove any responsibility to create an experience,” he said. “You drink enough alcohol, you can have an experience. But without drinking, other things have to create the experience. We do drag shows, karaoke. ... We offer more than just sitting at the bar.”
If you want to sit at the bar, drink in hand, you could technically still do that, of course — the glass just won’t have any hooch in it.
Even before Sans, Marshall enjoyed coming up with full-flavored, zero-proof cocktails. Currently, he’s developing a distilled nonalcoholic spirit made with smoke, mesquite and pecan to replicate an old fashioned. Marshall has already tested it, with promising results, at the East Austin spot. It adds a bourbonlike flair to drinks that typically don’t have such flavors. Call the cocktail it’ll be served in the Sans Fashioned, he said.
So far, Sans is only open on Friday nights and some Saturdays — when it’s hardest to find alternative activities to drinking. Ideally, Marshall said he would have the bar open more regularly, but it has taken years to draw enough attention to the concept as it is. Sans Bar started as a series of pop-ups, including at South by Southwest last year. He’s also taken the Sans Bar concept on the road for pop-up events across the country.
“We thought it would be wise to start small,” he said.
The Sans Bar team might have to expand hours soon, though. As interest in alcohol-free beverages and spaces grows, articles from outlets like NPR and the New York Times have explored what being sober curious is all about. Just don’t say that it’s some kind of trend.
“It’s disheartening to see it being called a trend, because even though everyone’s writing about it now, talking about it, I’ve been doing this for 12 years,” he said. “It’s not just me. You look around the country and you see attitudes about drinking are changing. This is more than just a trend. It’s a movement.”

The Toxic Back Story to the Charge That Jews Have a Dual Loyalty

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- When President Trump said this week that American Jews who chose to vote for Democrats were being disloyal, he was flirting with a notion that has fueled anti-Semitism for generations and has been at the root of some of the most brutal violence inflicted upon Jews in their history.
The accusation that Jews have a "dual loyalty" -- that they are not to be trusted because their true allegiance is to their religion, rather than to the country in which they live -- dates back thousands of years. It animated the Nazis in 1930s Germany, when they accused Jewish people of being traitors and used charges of disloyalty to justify their arrests, persecutions and mass killings.
After the founding of Israel, the charge was that Jews were more loyal to Israel, the Jewish state, than to their own countries. The smear persists in various forms to this day: It is a common refrain of white supremacists who claim there is a secret plot orchestrated by Jews to replace white people through mass migration and racial integration.
"The Jews have been a persistent minority for thousands of years, living in exile, living in diasporas, and the Jews have been made convenient scapegoats for various purposes," said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. "That's why they often call anti-Semitism the oldest hatred."
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump drew a barrage of criticism from Jewish organizations and anti-hate groups when he said, as he assailed a pair of Democratic congresswomen who are harshly critical of Israel, that Jews who vote for Democrats show "either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty." On Wednesday, as he retweeted a conspiracy theorist saying that Jews in Israel loved the president "like he's the king of Israel," Mr. Trump used the same language, telling reporters that "if you want to vote Democrat, you are being very disloyal to Jewish people and very disloyal to Israel."
A look at the long and ugly history of the dual loyalty canard helps explain why Jewish leaders and anti-hate groups have reacted so strongly to Mr. Trump's comments.
"This has got a very bad, toxic back story to it," said Aaron David Miller, a veteran Middle East peace negotiator who served in administrations of both political parties. "The words 'disloyalty' or 'dual loyalty' cannot appear within the same sentence as the words 'Jews' or 'American Jews' without legitimately raising the question of whether or not what is intended is to level that pernicious charge."
How the Charge Was Born
As far back as the Middle Ages, Jews were tagged in their communities as inherently untrustworthy and suspect, incapable of being loyal to their ruler because of their ties to other Jews around the world. They were also viewed as a threat to the church because of their religious beliefs.
Christian leaders promoted the idea that Jews crucified Jesus Christ, and several myths took hold about Jewish people, including the so-called blood libel, a myth that Jews used the blood of Christian children in rituals. Those slanders fueled riots against Jews, sometimes referred to as pogroms.
A Stereotype Festers and Flourishes
Later, as Jews settled throughout Europe, their loyalty was often in question. When Napoleon emancipated the Jews in France after the revolution, he said he would grant them full equality if they would reaffirm that they were subject to French law and would no longer consider themselves "a nation within a nation." Jews agreed.
But the suspicions festered. In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus, a French military captain who was Jewish, was falsely accused of passing military secrets to the Germans and was convicted in a French military court.
"People were willing to believe it, even though the evidence from the very outset was shaky, because it made sense to them," said Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of modern Jewish history and Holocaust studies at Emory University. "They had been so exposed to this stereotype, it had become so much the pivot point and the central element of anti-Semitism that Jews have other loyalties, that it seemed like it must be true, and they were ready to believe the worst."
Professor Lipstadt said that was why when the Nazis began denigrating Jews, falsely accusing them of having betrayed their country and undermined its security, people were willing to believe it.
"The dual loyalty canard that has plagued Jews is the fertile soil in which centuries of these stereotypes have taken root and grown," she said.
Stalin played on the same notion in 1946 during a speech in Moscow attacking Jewish writers as "rootless cosmopolitans" who were not fully loyal to the Soviet Union.
Nation vs. Religion
One reason that Jews have struggled to shake accusations of having dual loyalty is rooted in their own history. For centuries, Jews were regarded as a nation with their own distinct culture and laws, rather than merely a religious group.
"The tension within Judaism is, are we a people, a nation, a tribe, a religion?" said Steven R. Weisman, the author of "The Chosen Wars: How Judaism Became an American Religion" and a former New York Times reporter. "Jews have been uncomfortable seeing themselves as a people -- even the 'chosen people' -- and through various episodes throughout history, worked to show that they were just as patriotic and loyal as anyone else."
During the Civil War, for instance, Mr. Weisman said, Jews joined the military in disproportionate numbers on both sides, in part to demonstrate their devotion to their country in the face of stereotypes that their allegiances were suspect.
As recently as 2000, when former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman became the first Jewish person to run for vice president, he faced questions about how his religion might affect his policy positions and leadership.
Trump Stirs the Pot
This week was not the first time that Mr. Trump has appeared to question Jews' loyalties. This past spring, speaking to American Jews at an event sponsored by the Republican Jewish Coalition, he referred to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as "your prime minister."
His comments this week were meant to target Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both Democrats and outspoken critics of Israel who have both made their own remarks appearing to question Jews' loyalty.
Ms. Omar apologized in February for saying that support for Israel was "all about the Benjamins baby," a reference to hundred-dollar bills, but then ignited further controversy when she argued that she was being tagged as anti-Semitic merely for criticizing Israel.
"I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is O.K. for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country," Ms. Omar said then.
Ms. Tlaib was roundly criticized in January for saying that lawmakers supporting a Republican bill protecting states and cities that sever ties with companies boycotting Israel "forgot what country they represent."
She later said she was referring to senators, not Jewish people.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
In the close to 25 years that I have been a subscriber to The New York Times, I have never read the magazine section cover to cover. This past Sunday's edition, the 1619 Project, devoted to the history of slavery and its consequences, was a first. It was a true eye opener for me, a native New Yorker, who had no idea about the true origin of slavery in America.
Thank you for this insightful issue, which taught me more about my fellow citizens of this land than all the American history courses I took in high school and college and all the reading I've done since then.

To the Editor:
I have eagerly awaited the publication of the 1619 Project since it was announced. I read all of the digital content, but wanted to have the print edition in my hands. Today, I went to my nearest bookseller to purchase a copy.
Although I had read the digital versions, a tear streamed down my cheek as I read the print copy. My father, who was an amateur history buff, died before Barack Obama became president. He died before he could see a major newspaper of record acknowledge the history of slavery, its roots and its impact so prominently. He spent his meager free time faithfully unearthing and assembling the shards of history for himself that you have assembled into this mosaic for all to see.
I cried for him and all the others like him who wanted a true reporting of America's history of slavery to be known.

To the Editor:
The 1619 Project may be one of the most important series you've ever produced. The descriptions of how racism is embedded in our daily lives are appalling, horrifying and shameful. The articles are a direct rebuke to Mitch McConnell's statement that he and his peers have nothing to do with slavery. We all do, even those of us whose ancestors immigrated here after emancipation.
White people simply have no idea how exhausting this embedded racism is, how everything from driving a car to shopping to seeing a physician is tinged with fear and resignation that no one will see the individual of color as a peer.
I hope this disturbing and vital series prompts conversations that continue and continue. We have yet to confront our past, and you are challenging us to do so.

To the Editor:
I very much appreciate and enjoy the 1619 Project, both as a necessary corrective to the way that American history is often portrayed and as an impetus to productive change. At the same time, I take issue with a metaphor of "DNA" that appears in several essays, such as "Anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." The metaphor is misleading and perhaps pernicious, as it obscures agency.
Every generation receives traditions, found in laws, customs and institutions, but every person in every generation has significant leeway in how to understand and live those traditions. Traditions -- perhaps the meaning of "DNA" in this metaphor -- make racism easier, but ultimately it is the quotidian choices that we have and continue to make that cause racism, as they will its eradication.

To the Editor:
The magazine edition with the 1619 Project was the best single piece of journalism I have seen in a long time. I beg of you to publish it in book form so it is available for libraries and home book shelves. Many thanks to all those who contributed to its research and publication.

Texto completo: President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani clarified the president's statement explaining that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats are disloyal "to Israel."
On Tuesday, Trump said that American Jews who vote for Democrats are either uninformed or disloyal, but it wasn't clear based on the president's remarks who those Jewish Americans would be disloyal to.
“I think any Jewish people that vote for a Democrat, I think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Giuliani clarified those remarks on Twitter, Wednesday morning.
"Trump Accuses Jewish Democrats of ‘Great Disloyalty’ - The New York Times," Giuliani tweeted. "This is routine for NYT and J St. But really disappointed a rep of ADL would feign confusion about ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩’s statement. POTUS is referring to disloyalty to Israel."TweetIn Giuliani's tweet, he said it was "routine" for the New York Times and J Street, a "pro-Israel, pro-peace" organization looking for "a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," to "feign confusion" about the president's remarks.
The former New York City mayor also said he was "really disappointed" that the anti-defamation league would do the same. TweetADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted, "It’s unclear who @POTUS is claiming Jews would be 'disloyal' to, but charges of disloyalty have long been used to attack Jews. As we’ve said before, it's possible to engage in the democratic process w/o these claims. It's long overdue to stop using Jews as a political football."

Thomas L. Friedman: How the Palestinian-Israeli peace process became a farce

Texto completo: Last week’s ugly mess involving the abortive visit to Israel of two Democratic congresswomen was useful for only one reason: It exposed how much the Palestinian-Israeli peace process has become a pathetic festival of magical thinking, performance art, reality denial, political fundraising and outright political fraud. It’s become about everything except what it needs to succeed: courageous, fair-minded, creative diplomacy and leadership.
At the official U.S. level, Jared Kushner has spent three years ginning up a peace plan that he still won’t show anyone. So far, his only achievement is an Israeli-Palestinian economic conference in Bahrain that no Israeli or Palestinian officials attended.
Kushner actually seems to believe that the problem can be solved by the Israelis and Gulf Arabs funding a leveraged buyout of Palestinian aspirations for sovereignty and statehood.
Kushner deserves some credit for fresh thinking about how to attract investment to the West Bank, but he lapsed into magical thinking when he allowed all the diplomatic features of his plan to be dictated by the political needs and desires of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The reason his plan has not been released yet is that it does not serve Bibi’s election needs. Even though it reportedly offers the Palestinians only some diluted form of autonomy in the West Bank and Arab districts of Jerusalem, any new powers for them are a nonstarter right now for Netanyahu, who needs every right-wing settler vote he can muster to win reelection Sept. 17.
President Donald Trump says he will release Kushner’s plan after the Israeli election, but I would not trust that for a second. Trump’s only participation in this process has been to exploit it by being slavishly pro-Bibi to win political donations from Sheldon Adelson and votes from Jews in Florida. If Bibi doesn’t want Kushner’s plan released, it won’t be.
But let me not pick on Kushner. If Kushner has no Palestinian partner for his leveraged buyout plan, mainstream Democrats have no Israeli partner for their golden oldie — the “two-state solution.” They pretend that Netanyahu is a partner for a two-state solution, even though Bibi’s been openly, gradually but steadily moving Israel toward annexation of the West Bank.
Israel and its allies on Capitol Hill have even stymied an attempt by some Democratic and Republican senators to pass a mild resolution in the Senate saying a two-state solution should still be on the table.
But let me not be too hard on the Democrats — the American center left — because the Israeli center left has no plan on the table, either. The main Israeli center-left party, called Blue and White, is not running on a platform that even acknowledges the principle of two states for two people: Israelis and Palestinians. It fears looking naive to Israelis and losing right-of-center votes.
Talk about reality denial, the most existential question in Israel — what to do with the 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank — is not on the September ballot.
Then again, one should not come down too hard on the American and Israeli center lefts since the Palestinians also have not put any detailed two-state peace plan on the table, and, even if they did, they no longer have a single governing authority to negotiate for them and definitively end the conflict with Israel. The Palestinians are divided between an Islamist Hamas-led government in Gaza and the more secular Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. And both are teetering on failed-state status.
Not to be outdone in magical thinking or performance art, the progressive Democratic far-left contingents in the U.S. Congress, and on college campuses, and in Europe, also have no plan. They have an attitude . It’s often expressed in support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. If you go to its website, BDS specifically states that it “does not advocate for a particular solution to the conflict and does not call for either a ‘one state solution’ or a ‘two state solution.’ ”
BDS does, though, specifically call for a boycott of Israel until it stops “its occupation and colonization of all Arab lands,” but it’s vague on whether that is just the West Bank and East Jerusalem or all of Israel. It also demands the return of all Palestinian refugees and their descendants since the 1948 war — not to a future West Bank Palestinian state but to their original villages in what is now Israel — while making no mention of the rights of the Jews to a state in their historical homeland.
As such, the pro-BDS progressives — who do not distinguish between boycotting Israeli products from occupied territories and boycotting the idea of a Jewish state — have no plan or real Israeli partner.
So there you have it. We have peace plans with no partners and movements with no peace plans.
The only hope I see is for the emergence of an Israeli leader ready to boldly make a unilateral — but coordinated — separation from the West Bank in the way that Ariel Sharon made a unilateral — but uncoordinated — withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. In a unilateral separation, the Israeli army would retain overall security control of the West Bank but cede much more day-to-day economic control and political control to Palestinians, and curb Jewish settlement deep in the West Bank.
There are currently about 105,000 Jewish settlers now living deep inside the West Bank, right in the heart of where any Palestinian state in a two-state solution would be located. That is, they are living beyond the West Bank settlement blocks, where another 300,000 Jewish settlers live but would remain in any peace deal.
If that settlement process deep inside the West Bank is not halted immediately — and incentives created for those settlers to move — there will be no hope ever for a two-states-for-two-people peace deal. The only option left will be one state for two people, a recipe for permanent strife.
So, Israelis and Palestinians don’t just need a plan for peace now, they need a plan to save a plan for peace. That’s how bad things are.
The only Israeli leader powerful enough to provide that right now is Netanyahu, but he is focused only on saving himself from indictment on corruption charges. Could Benny Gantz, the former Israeli army chief of staff and leader of the Blue and White party, be that person if he defeats Netanyahu? I hope. He has the potential.
I am reading a smart and prescient new book related to all of this, titled “Be Strong and of Good Courage: How Israel’s Most Important Leaders Shaped Its Destiny,” by veteran U.S. peace negotiator Dennis Ross and analyst David Makovsky. I asked Ross what was the key difference between Israel’s leaders then and now.
“As much as Israel’s founding leaders may have disagreed with one another, men like David Ben-Gurion and Menachem Begin always in the end put the interests of the state above their own,” Ross said. “They understood that whether you were making a choice or doing nothing, you were making a choice.”
Two quotes in this book stand out. One comes from Begin, the right-wing prime minister, after he was criticized by fellow Israeli religious-nationalists for offering a plan for Palestinian autonomy in December 1977 to Anwar Sadat. Begin told his critics that his proposal demonstrated “decency” and that Israel could not ethically control land without granting rights. Israel, Begin added, would never “be like Rhodesia,” then an apartheid state.
The other quote is from Sharon, who once remarked to Ross when asked about his big decision to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza in 2005: “My generation is the last one that is not afraid to make big decisions. I fear that the next generation will be led by politicians and they won’t decide.”
Let’s hope that’s Sharon’s prediction is wrong. Otherwise, Begin’s Rhodesia fears will come true.

Texto completo: Paranoia is a very common mental disorder, and political conspiracy fevers are its most conspicuous symptoms. The only people reliably immune to conspiracy theorizing are those who put their faith in human stupidity as the default explanation for human disaster. It’s easy to see the appeal of theories which trace all our ills to the Illuminati, the Elders of Zion, the Transnational Freemasons, the Armenian Diaspora, etc. It can be comforting to believe your life is controlled by the diabolical intelligence of a small evil elite rather than millions of dimwits.
These general observations lead me to the point of the column: the life and death of Jeffrey Epstein have laid the groundwork for a stupendous explosion of competing conspiracy theories. It provides all the elements needed to create vile, vast, mysterious, endlessly ramified stories.
Pay attention to the plural form, there are fishy, smelly, shadowy details enough for dozens of competing theories. Doesn’t matter how many. They can all coexist, depending of the market niche they fill. Those separate niches are determined by who the Believers want to see targeted.
Sunday’s New York Times (Aug. 18) devoted a full page to describing the last days of Jeffrey Epstein. Read it and you will see a long list of witnesses and actors that show up in those few days. The NYT journalists proposed no conspiracy, but that doesn’t matter. They provide a lengthy list of “suspects” and that’s enough. We can always rely on the theorists provide the names of suspects. The more suspects the more they like it. This is paradoxical in terms of the rules for jury trial; defense lawyers always love alternative suspects. These rule don’t govern conspiracy theorizing.
Conspiracy theorizing resembles board games, the more pieces in the game, the more exciting they are. Let’s count what the theorists have to work with right now, just for starters. For prime movers we have Hillary and Donald. Hillary-haters have already built an impressive list of assassinations she ordered, for either self-protection or revenge. And we have photos of Bill, Hillary and Donald sharing happy moments Jeff. Bill kept company with America’s foremost pederast on multiple occasions, his sexual indulgences are a matter of record. What happy moments did Jeff share with Bill apart from the ones already on the public record?
The Donald’s dedication to self-indulgence is no secret (it has been on public display for years) and it has included sexual indulgences (also on display). He says he broke off relations with Jeff years ago. Wouldn’t he be more at ease if his old pal was no longer alive to contradict him?

Silencing witnesses, always a big part of conspiracies. Remember that familiar axiom of political scandal, “the cover-up is more damaging than the crime being covered up.” The NYT article provides a list involved in the Arch-Pederast’s final days. The reporters. It tells us, gathered their information from “dozens … of interviews with law enforcement officials, Bureau of Prisons employees, lawyers and others.” Almost all of their interviewees “spoke only on condition of anonymity.” We may think of these dozens as witnesses, the conspiracists see dozens of accomplices, and/or persons who will have to be eliminated. Their anonymity won’t save them. The conspiracy sniffers study future obituary columns with tireless vigilance. Every death will be chalked up on their assassination list.
We can only skim the surface in the space available in a newspaper column. The dozens of books that ambitious authors will spin out of the mass of material will provide the rest. The financial machinations of the deceased remain mysterious. The mob of celebrities he collected will come under suspicion of sexual hanky-panky and whatever; Maine’s George Mitchell just for example. I might like to believe it, but I don’t. Doesn’t matter. A bit of Epstein slime has brushed against him and the conspiracy mongers will never let it go.

Texto completo: A Maryland man who allegedly harassed a South Florida woman with over 150 pages worth of messages threatening to kill her and all Hispanics in Miami and elsewhere has been arrested by the FBI.
Eric Lin, 35, was arrested Friday in Seattle and charged with making threatening communications via Facebook toward one unidentified South Florida woman, who believed that Lin targeted her after meeting her at a restaurant she worked at in Miami.
In the messages, Lin – who had recently moved from Clarksburg, Maryland, to Seattle, prosecutors say – allegedly professed his Nazi beliefs, his support of President Donald Trump and his plans to kidnap the woman and kill her and other Latinos and Hispanics.
The woman first received a Facebook message in late May from an account belonging to Lin, court documents show. It contained an image of Lin, superimposed with a Hitler "filter. " A follow-up message described the image as a "Composite of My Face with the Fuhrer. "
"I FOLLOW ONLY ADOLF HITLER AND THEN GOD," Lin said in one message. "THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. "
The threats allegedly sent by Lin grew increasingly violent and racist as time went on, according to court records obtained by The New York Times. They say Lin repeated graphic threats against the victim's family, as well as all Latinos and Hispanics.
One such message read: "I will stop at Nothing until you, your family, your friends,, your entire WORTHLESS LATIN RACE IS RACIALLY EXTERMINATED!"
Another message threatened to keep nonwhite people – described using racial slurs – "in line," according to the documents.
"I Thank God everyday President Donald Trump is President and that he will launch a Racial War and Crusade,'" he wrote, according to prosecutors.
Trump recently condemned "white supremacy" after a gunman in El Paso targeted Mexican people, killing 22.
Later messages allegedly sent by Lin invoked Adolf Hitler and threatened to murder and cannibalize the woman.
Around this time, Lin allegedly conspired with an associate he identified as "Chris" to kidnap the woman, offering to pay $10,000 to hold her hostage and take her to Seattle.
In one message, Lin is accused of writing, "I doubt the FBI would care much about her" due to her ethnicity.

Texto completo: When Barack Obama was president and the economic statistics were good, then-candidate Donald Trump said they were fake. When Trump became president and inherited the exact same stats, they suddenly became real.
Now that they're turning south, they're apparently fake once more.
Trump, aided by his economic brain trust of cranks and sycophants, believes any indicator showing the U.S. economy could be in trouble must be fabricated. It's all part of an anti-Trump conspiracy, he rants, according to reports in The Washington Post, The Associated Press and The New York Times.
And move over, Illuminati, because this particular conspiracy is massive.
It's led by the Federal Reserve, Democrats and the media, of course, or so say Trump and his Fox News minions. But it also includes the entire U.S. bond market, which flashed a warning sign last week when the Treasury yield curve inverted (meaning long-term bonds had lower interest rates than short-term ones, which usually predates a downturn).
Also colluding are the many farmers, retailers, manufacturers and economists who have been warning for more than a year that the burden of Trump's tariffs is mainly borne by Americans, not China or other trading partners, and also that uncertainty over trade tensions can paralyze hiring, investment and purchasing decisions, which we need to keep the economy expanding.
The cabal even transcends borders. Besides Trump's trade wars, after all, the main risk to the U.S. economy involves contagion from abroad. And right now, nine major economies are either in a recession or on the verge of one.
The White House has reportedly declined to develop contingency plans for a downturn because it doesn't want to validate this "negative narrative." This is, in a word, idiotic. As others have analogized, it's like refusing to buy a fire extinguisher because you're afraid of feeding a "negative narrative" that you might someday face a fire.
Administration officials decided the best way to deal with recession risk, which they of course aren't personally worried about, was through a show of force on TV. There, Trump's economic advisers assured Americans they definitely, certainly, cross-their-hearts-and-hope-to-die don't see reason to worry.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's strategy was to deny that the data show Americans are paying higher prices on tariffed goods (though we are) and also that the yield curve had recently inverted (though it did). On that latter point, Navarro said the curve was merely "flat" and therefore doesn't signal a possible recession. In virtually identical language across interviews, he told audiences that he had authority in this matter because he "didn't write the book on the yield curve," he wrote "several books on the efficacy of the yield curve as a leading economic indicator."
What Navarro failed to mention, though, is that these books say that both inverted and "flat" yield curves are usually signs of impending recession. One such book, from 2006, explicitly mocked business leaders for failing to prepare for the 2001 recession because they had ignored "the ominous progression of the yield curve" that began with the curve's flattening.
So, yeah, you can add mid-2000s-era Navarro to the list of anti-Trump conspirators too.
Trump's National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow hit the Sunday shows too. For his part, he bizarrely pretended other troubling economic data (in this case, on consumer sentiment) didn't exist. He also repeatedly told viewers: "Let's not be afraid of optimism."
And look, yes, it would be unhelpful for public officials to go on TV and tell everybody to panic, pull their money out of the market and stuff it under their mattresses. The White House obviously wants to project confidence instead.
But that confidence is convincing only if it's credible -- because, say, the White House has acknowledged how its own trade policies are contributing to recession risk and is committed to reversing them. Or because it has a competent team in place if recession strikes.
Neither is true.
Instead, Kudlow's call for optimism has a whiff of Peter Pan logic about it: If only we believe in fairies hard enough, we can always save Tinker Bell -- even when we're sending her out into a hailstorm. If you believe, clap your hands; don't let Tink die!
It's hard to imagine nervous Americans are really this credulous. Then again, perhaps we were never the intended audience for such performances. Sure, maybe White House aides are trying to fool the public into believing recession warning signs don't exist. But maybe they're actually just trying to fool their boss.
A frightening conspiracy theory, indeed.

Texto completo: STATE DEPARTMENT
Trump Weighs Pick
For Russia Post
President Trump said he was considering naming Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan as the next U.S. ambassador to Russia, a role that has become increasingly fraught under the Trump administration amid deteriorating relations with Moscow.
Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Sullivan was very respected and "could very well be" the nominee.
One administration official said the president was expected to name Mr. Sullivan to the ambassador post, which the New York Times reported earlier. Another aide said the White House hadn't decided. If nominated and confirmed, Mr. Sullivan would succeed Jon Huntsman Jr., who said earlier this month that he would step down in early October.
Mr. Sullivan has served as deputy secretary of state since May 2017. He has led discussions between the U.S. and Russia on counterterrorism and arms control and has played a leading role on sanctions, terror designations and other matters related to Russia, according to a State Department official.
Also on Tuesday, the president reiterated his call for Russia to rejoin the Group of Seven world leaders, days before the group is set to convene in France.

Established Retailers Debut Clothing Subscriptions to Compete With Rent the Runway

Texto completo: Rent the Runway is facing a new wave of competing services. Only this time, the startup is being forced to share the clothes lending spotlight with long-established companies.
In the past several months, major brick-and-mortar retailers, including Bloomingdale’s, Banana Republic and Urban Outfitters, announced their own respective versions of monthly rental subscriptions.

Just in time for back-to-school and holiday shopping season, 2019 is proving to be the year the retail industry is finally giving into the rental model after decades of focus on sales.
For younger shoppers, Urban Outfitters Inc. announced Nuuly in July. The $88 a month subscription also includes access to articles from the parent company’s other labels, Anthropologie and Free People, as well as third-party labels and vintage pieces. On the higher end of the fashion scale, department store Bloomingdale’s unveiled its $149-per-month “My List” service debuting in September, in which shoppers can choose up to four designer items to borrow. Meanwhile, Gap-owned Banana Republic announced Style Passport last week, hoping to attract customers looking to borrow the brand’s preppy styles for an $85 monthly fee.
Aside from the already-launched services, some retail chains like Macy’s and J.C. Penney are currently experimenting with used clothes rentals in hopes of swaying shoppers to their traditional department stores.
There is no doubt the popularity of Rent the Runway among fashion-conscious customers has inspired the overall industry to hop on the subscription wagon. It seems fashion executives have finally caught on to the “anti-ownership” reputation that millennials have become known for, favoring renting over investing, as evident by the success of streaming platforms like Spotify and Netflix.
The trend is what lead to Bloomingdale’s My List, the company’s executive VP and general merchandise manager of ready-to-wear Denise Magid told Women’s Wear Daily during the announcement.
“Urbanization has led to people living in smaller homes or apartments with limited space for clothes. Netflix has changed the way we consume movies, while Uber and Airbnb have made it second nature to share our car rides and our homes. Fashion is no exception and our customer is no exception—she wants variety, discovery and experience,” Magid said.
While Rent the Runway has a new army of fashion brands to fight off the catwalk, the tech unicorn has other challenges as it scales. Not only has the company introduced kidswear and a West Elm partnership to offer home decor, Rent the Runway is also reportedly struggling to supply high demand and improve customer service as it grows.
Earlier this year the New York City-based startup, which operates an e-commerce site as well as retail shops around the country, became the latest to achieve “unicorn” status in the direct-to-consumer category. Rent the Runway’s last funding round of $125 million, led by Bain Capital, helped it achieve a billion dollar valuation.
Co-founder and CEO Jennifer Hyman told The New York Times in March that the fresh batch of funding will be used to create “the Amazon Prime of rental.”
“You’ll continue to see that this new living closet that we’ve created is going to apply not only to how you get dressed, but it’ll apply to all of the products that you use,” Hyman said.
Rent the Runway was unable to provide Observer with a comment on the similar services launching by the time of publication.

Darien man charged in Caribbean hotel worker’s death to speak out

Texto completo: DARIEN — Gavin Scott Hapgood, the UBS trader accused of killing a hotel worker during a violent struggle while on vacation with his family in the Caribbean, spoke publicy for the first time Tuesday
“On April 13, my family’s life was changed forever. Since that day we’ve been living a nightmare that has gradually become a reality,” Hapgood told a room of reporters in Midtown Manhattan.’
“We want the same thing as the people of Anguila, for the truth to come out,” Hapgood said, referencing the British Caribbean territory where the incident occurred in April, in Hapgood’s room at the Moulihanna Resort on while vacationing with his wife and three children.
The Darien man and his attorney, Juliya Arbisman, of Amsterdam & Partners LLP based in London, spoke about the three mandatory trips to Anguilla required this week and the toll the required appearances have taken on Hapgood and his family, especially “in the face of a credible threat of violence,” Arbisman said.
Hapgood, 44, has been charged with manslaughter in the death of 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel. According to Arbisman, Hapgood returned yesterday from Anguilla and is scheduled to return to the Caribbean island on Thursday for a court appearance. Because of threats communicated to Arbisman and Hapgood through Anguillan police, they’ve been advised to spend as little time on the island as possible.
A toxicology report released last week revealed Mitchel tested positive for cocaine, Delta-9 THC (the active substance in marijuana) and other drugs. The report also showed that Mitchel had a blood-alcohol content level of .181, which is more than double the legal limit in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is .08.
“The toxicology report confirms that Scott Hapgood had no choice but to defend himself and his children from the frenzied attack of a man under the influence of a dangerous combination of illegal drugs and alcohol," Arbisman said Monday in a prepared statement.
Arbisman criticized Anguillan authorities for withholding the toxicology report results until a week before Hapgood was scheduled to appear in court. The tests were conducted by a Pennsylvania lab that provided a draft analysis in June.
“The two-month delay in releasing the damning toxicology report raises serious concerns about the prosecution’s respect for due process,” Arbisman said. “Likewise, the report itself demonstrates how out of control and heavily drugged the deceased was at the time of the assault and undermines any basis for bringing these charges in the first place.”
Mitchel was also facing rape charges stemming from a March 25 incident with his former girlfriend and mother of their child, according to a New York Times report. The case was pending when he died.
However, the woman told the Times Mitchel didn’t rape her, and that the incident leading to his arrest was “a misunderstanding.”
The Hapgood family has said the Darien man was defending himself and his young children after Mitchel came to their room to fix a bathroom sink. Hapgood contended the sink was never broken and no one called for someone to come to their room, but he trusted Mitchel because he was wearing a hotel uniform.
The family has accused Mitchel of pulling a knife, resulting in Hapgood “fighting for his life” and was bitten multiple times, including on the face.
Residents on the island were outraged Hapgood was permitted to return to Connecticut after Mitchel’s death.
Hapgood was originally held at Her Majesty’s Prison in Anguilla when he was denied bail. But he was later released on bond after his attorney appealed to the High Court.
The family has said it cooperated with authorities after the killing and shared a photo of Hapgood with injuries he apparently sustained during the incident.
Mitchel has been described as a “strong, loving and kind-hearted person,” by a person who claimed to be his family member. Earlier this year, a GoFundMe page created for his family garnered $3,470.
The creator of the GoFundMe page says Hapgood asked Mitchel to come to his family’s hotel room.
Mitchel’s name has been spelled as Mitchell in various reports, including on the toxicology report.

NYT columnist: It's 'a scandal' that media didn't cover Omar and Tlaib Israel trip sponsors

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Bari Weiss said that it was "a scandal" that most major media outlets ignored the history behind the organization that had planned to sponsor Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib's trip to Israel.
Last week, the Israeli government, after being pressured by President Trump publicly, decided to bar Omar and Tlaib from entering the country citing a law that allowed them to refuse entry to anyone who has publicly supported a boycott of Israel, which they have. Tlaib was then offered a chance to travel to the country to see her family on the condition that she wouldn't protest while there, and she refused.
Weiss appeared on CNN's Reliable Sources Sunday morning and she brought up the canceled trip in a discussion about how reporting on lies provides amplification for the lie itself.

She brought up Tlaib and Omar's canceled trip and then added, "But another huge story, one that has not been covered by any mainstream paper or network is the fact that their trip to Israel, or as they're calling Palestine, was being sponsored by a group that literally published neo-Nazi blood libels and said that it supported female suicide bombers. You know, hailing them as heroes. That's a scandal."
The trip, as Weiss explained, was sponsored by Miftah, an organization that seeks to highlight the Palestinian plight. But, they have also praised female suicide bombers and they regularly promote anti-Semitic doctrines, such as the “blood libel,” which suggests “Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover.”
"If someone like Steve King was going to Sweden or Norway and eating with neo-Nazi groups, that would be front page news," Weiss continued. "One of the questions I think we need to ask is: Is the fact that Trump has lodged racist horrible attacks on these women, has that made them sort of untouchable for us to cover in an accurate way?"

Texto completo: A trio of thwarted mass shooting plots. Firefighters missing off the coast of Florida. And an update on the president’s not-so-little son. Here's the news you need to know Monday.
But first, there is good in the world: El Paso teachers asked for notes to comfort students after the mass shooting. They received thousands of postcards and letters.
NYPD officer accused of chokehold fired
The police officer who subdued Eric Garner moments before his death will be fired, an NYPD official announced Monday. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, a 13-year department veteran, was accused of placing a banned chokehold on Garner during an arrest five years ago in New York as Garner cried, "I can't breathe. " An autopsy found Garner's death was caused in part by a chokehold, and the case was ruled a homicide. Video of the arrest triggered nationwide protests as Garner's dying words became a battle cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill's decision to fire the officer drew outrage from the police union and a guarded "thank you" from one of Garner's children.
Epstein's death shook up federal prisons
The acting director of the federal prison system has been ousted after the suicide of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General William Barr announced the removal of Hugh Hurwitz on Monday. Epstein was awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy about a week ago when the 66-year-old was found dead at Metropolitan Correctional Center, part of the U. S. Bureau of Prisons. His death is the subject of at least three federal investigations, including a look into whether Epstein's guards slept through checks on his prison cell during the hours before his death.

State schools may take your taxes but not your kids
Out-of-state enrollment is skyrocketing as some public colleges and universities have become a battleground for geographically diverse students. A USA TODAY analysis shows public universities have sharply decreased numbers of in-state students – and increased the number of out-of-state ones – in freshman classes over the past five years. Residents in some states demand universities reserve enough space to serve the students of taxpaying residents. Is your own state or college aggressively targeting out-of-state students?

3 mass shooting plots stopped around the country
Three mass shooting plots were thwarted and three men were arrested in unrelated cases, according to authorities in Connecticut, Florida and Ohio. The arrests come amid renewed cries for legislation to change the country's gun laws in the wake of mass shootings. Here's what we know about the three cases:
Connecticut: A 22-year-old man was arrested on four counts of illegal possession of large-capacity magazines, police said Thursday. Posts on Facebook showed an “interest in committing a mass shooting," police said.
Florida: A 25-year-old Daytona Beach man was charged with making threats to commit a mass shooting and arrested Friday.
Ohio: Police arrested a 20-year-old man Friday after receiving a tip about an online video in which the man identified himself as the shooter at a Jewish community center – an incident that hadn't happened yet, according to the FBI.
Has anyone seen Barron Trump lately?
America hasn't seen or heard much about 13-year-old Barron Trump since his dad became president, so many people might have missed it: The kid has really grown. He's at least slightly taller than either of his parents, even the first lady in her customary 5-inch stilettos.

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

America Ferrera talks shooting, letter to Latinos

Texto completo: Actress America Ferrera, who is married to former El Pasoan Ryan Piers Williams, is among 200 artists, activists and civil rights leaders who penned a letter of solidarity to the Latino community Friday morning.
The letter, titled "Querida Familia Latina," was published in the New York Times, El Nuevo Herald in Florida, La Opinión in Los Angeles, and El Diario in New York.
Ferrera said it was shocking to hear the news of the mass shooting at the East Side Walmart on Aug. 3.
"My husband is from El Paso and his entire family is still there in the area. Every single mass shooting is a tragedy. It is incredibly alarming and painful to witness," she said. "But it is a particularly shocking experience when it happens so close to the home of the people you love."
Her husband is an actor, director and writer, and they have one child together.
"I have been having all kinds of conversations with my friends and colleagues and organizations that I work with. And we all felt there was a real need for our community to hear a message of hope and strength and light," Ferrera said in an interview with the El Paso Times. "I know for myself, I have yearned to feel my community around me in light of the recent mass shootings in El Paso" and Dayton, Ohio, as well as the migrant raids in Mississippi.
She added, "This letter was an act of love meant to remind our community that we are not alone but in this together and we are going to go on in our lives with dignity and respect."
The letter states that the Latino community "has been smeared by political rhetoric and murdered in violent hate crimes" and referenced the separation of immigrant families.
"We have been targeted with mass shootings and mass ICE raids meant to terrify us, squash our hope and break our spirits," it states.
Ferrera said the letter is meant to bolster the Latin community all over the United States, recognize the contributions they have made and remind them to speak out against hate and support organizations that support Latinos.
"It's important to acknowledge this letter and this moment of solidarity is about showing up for our community and for our country. Any one of our communities can be targeted, and without an uproar and backlash, it makes us vulnerable," she said, referring to not only Latinos but also African Americans, the LGBTQ community and Muslims.
"Any time that happens, that hate has to be denounced and fought," she said. "We don't have any other option than to stand up against an attack against our community."
Ferrera said she hopes that others with large platforms will speak out against hate for the betterment of the nation and said the feedback on social media has been "fortifying."

I'd Rather Read With My Ears

Texto completo: I don't read books, I devour them. A friend recently asked how I read so many books so quickly. When I told him I listen to each one as an audiobook, he guffawed: "That doesn't count!"
He isn't alone in that view, but that doesn't mean he's right. Humans, after all, weren't always so beholden to the written word. From ancient Greek philosophers and Elizabethan thespians to revivalist preachers and barnstorming politicians, the world has long been captivated by the spoken word. Before the Sermon on the Mount became a series of Bible chapters, it was . . . a sermon.
Yet despite the rich oral origins of literature, in some book clubs there's an almost palpable tension between those who read and those who prefer to listen. What's more, as I've read book reviews and commentary online, I've frequently found evidence of people thumbing their noses at audiobooks.
Like it or not, our media landscape is continually changing. While print and e-book sales have either declined or remained stagnant, audiobook sales have doubled every year for a decade.
Maybe it's worth understanding why people like me prefer audiobooks in the first place. One obvious reason is convenience. Jessica Hamzelou explains in the New Scientist that when our minds wander, they switch "into autopilot mode," which enables us to "carry on doing tasks quickly, accurately, and without conscious thought." The region of our brains that does this is called the default mode network, or DMN, and it becomes active only when performing rote tasks.
That's great news for multitaskers. Driving, mundane work assignments, chores, exercising and grocery shopping can all be repetitive activities. Such tasks are likely to activate your brain's DMN. If you're going to perform the same rote activities anyway, why not immerse yourself in a good book at the same time?
Especially because listening as opposed to reading actually improves comprehension. In a recent New York Times op-ed, Daniel Willingham, a psychologist at the University of Virginia, explained the literary technique known as prosody: "the pitch, tempo and stress of spoken words. 'What a great party' can be a sincere compliment or sarcastic put-down, but they look identical on the page." Thus the written word can be ambiguous: "Inferences can go wrong, and hearing the audio version -- and therefore the correct prosody -- can aid comprehension."
There's also a kind of innate enjoyment that comes with hearing a great story read by a great narrator. Homer didn't write the "Iliad" or the "Odyssey" to be read on a page, and Shakespeare's plays were meant to be heard and seen on a stage. As the theater and film bring words to life, so too narration enhances the overall experience.
Instead of looking down on the medium, bibliophiles should celebrate the way audiobooks make the written word more inviting and accessible. Without them I'd likely never know the wonderful contents of so many books at all.
Read, yes. But as the most famous of all books puts it: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

Year 1919 packed with highs, lows for Chanute

Texto completo: The summer of 1919 was filled with uncertainty for the people of Champaign County, who in just two years had become big fans of Chanute Field and the pioneer aviators who flew there.

Chanute had been hastily built outside of Rantoul in 1917, just months after the United States entered World War I. It not only generated construction jobs and jolted the local economy but also created a minor tourism boon as people drove their carriages or automobiles to the army base to watch daring airmen fly the primitive and often unreliable airplanes.

But when the war ended in November 1918, Chanute's future was unsettled. Many of the young pilots returned to civilian life, such as Lt. D.L. Behncke who continued flying, but in less exciting style. In June 1919, he took part in a promotion dubbed the "aeroplane express service," delivering men's clothes from Chicago to the Jos. Kuhn & Co. store in Champaign. He landed his Curtiss biplane, the Society Brand I, in a field south of the Champaign Country Club.

Chanute's post-war future at first seemed safe. A March 1919 story in the Champaign Daily News quoted Rantoul banker William Wheat -- who later would become a congressman representing Rantoul and Chanute -- saying that he was confident the base would become permanent.

"Mr. Wheat writes that the plans have been formulated for making the air services a separate branch of the United States army and that the bill in regard to this has been passed (in) the Senate, being one of the riders of the appropriation bill," the News reported. "It is now in the hands of the committee before going to the President and there is little doubt that it will be passed."

But by August 1919, Chanute's future had dimmed. On Aug. 11, the News reported that "orders which practically closed Chanute aviation field" had been received, transferring 339 men to a California base. That left fewer than 400 men at Chanute "and it is understood here that other transfers will cut the force to four men, one non-commissioned officer and three privates."

A week later there was more bad news.

"What would seem to be further evidence that Chanute field was to be shuffled into the discard came on Monday when the government ordered that all civilian employees be discharged here by November 1," said the News.

By November, those early predictions had come true.

"Changing the status of Chanute field from a flying school to a temporary storage department sending 205 officers and men to Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas," was announced by the Army on Nov. 18, 1919. That left just eight men stationed at Chanute through the winter.

"Whether the order was permanent officers could not say," the News said. "The force at the field has never been below 100 men."

But a month later, Congress approved legislation appropriating millions of dollars for land purchases and operations, including more than $200,000 for Chanute.

In the meantime, the base became known nationally for all sorts of stunt flying and parachuting, as well as for frequent fatal air crashes.

In March 1921, Lt. Arthur Hamilton set a new world's record for parachute jumping when he leaped from the cockpit of an airplane 24,400 feet above the Champaign County soil.

"He said after landing that he had just enough strength to pull the cord releasing the chute," The New York Times reported. "There was little wind when he jumped and indications were he would light in the center of Chanute Field.

"About 1,300 feet up he stuck a strong air current which carried him beyond the field and eight miles north of Rantoul."

Later that year, a dog reportedly dropped by parachute about 1,500 feet above Chanute.

"When 'Bing' landed he worked himself free from his harness, overcame another dog set to prevent his onward journey and ran to headquarters with a message carried in a pouch suspended from his neck. The performance was to show the practicability of using dogs to carry messages when an airplane is unable to land."

In 1928, Chanute set another world's record when 10 parachute jumpers leapt from a 16-passenger Ford airplane.

"Perfect flying conditions greeted the rookies and all of them floated to safe landings on Chanute Field after their jumps from the giant plane as it roared across the airport at nearly 100 miles an hour," said an Associated Press story. "The multiple jump, in addition to making a new record, was planned to indicate how quickly passengers could clear a plane in safety in case of an accident in the air."

After dodging a bullet in 1919, the 1920s turned out to be a good decade for Chanute. More hangars were built, courses were added and the loss of personnel was reversed.

The 1930s would bring more threats to Chanute's existence, although the one-time tourist attraction would survive until 1993.

Texto completo: In nonprofit and for-profit businesses alike, visitors and customers want more than something to see or buy, they want a place to engage, interact, and feel a sense of place.
Two publications recently caught my eye that offer important insights for nonprofits. The first is a story in the New York Times called "Doubling Down and Passing the Baton" by Robin Pogrebin about four premier art galleries who are all enlarging their facilities at costs of $50 to $100 million.
This growth is coming on the heels of many small to mid-size galleries merging or closing their doors because of a decline in foot traffic. For some, it's seen as a game of one-upmanship and for others, it's an opportunity to redefine what it means to be a gallery.
"The future of art galleries lies in making spaces where people want to congregate," said Marc Glimcher, president of Pace Gallery. With this in mind, several major galleries are shifting their emphasis from selling and showing art to providing a full-service visitor experience that offers food, performance spaces, research libraries, and open storage.
One gallery plans to provide a multidisciplinary program of music, dance, film and conservation with a full-time curatorial director. Glimcher says galleries need to be more accessible and "less elitist and intimidating" to the general public. "Open it up," he said, "and get rid of the velvet ropes."
I see many parallels for nonprofits such as museums, history centers, zoos, preserves, botanical gardens, and the like. Pogrebin points out audiences have a "demand for firsthand interactions and a sense of community" which requires these spaces to be "a cultural experience."
In nonprofit and for-profit businesses alike, visitors and customers want more than something to see or buy, they want a place to engage, interact, and feel a sense of place. It would be an interesting and important conversation at a board meeting or planning retreat to think through what it means to be relevant and then to identify strategies to support this goal.
This article is a good reminder that nonprofits, like all businesses, need to recognize and act on the changing interests of donor, members, volunteers, funders, and key stakeholders to maintain long-term success.
Job frustrations The second publication I read is a new report published in The Chronicle of Philanthropy that says 51% of fundraisers plan to leave their job by 2021.
The three primary reasons are: (1) too much pressure to meet unrealistic fundraising goals; (2) too little pay; and (3) frustrating organizational cultures. A previous study in 2013 warned nonprofit leaders about the anxiety and unhappiness of fundraisers but apparently it wasn't enough because fundraisers are still leaving in droves.
This comes at a time when nonprofits are dealing with changes in funder priorities, crisis-related giving campaigns associated with catastrophic weather events and mass shootings, reductions in government funding, and changing donor motivations that all impact giving. And yet, every nonprofit I know needs more money to accomplish its mission.
The short tenure of fundraising staff creates a significant, costly challenge for nonprofits.
Author and consultant, Amy Eisenstein, ACFRE, estimates the cost of replacing a good fundraising staff person at anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 or more in lost fundraising revenue and costs associated with bringing on a new staff member. That assumes you can find someone to hire. I know of several local nonprofits who have had a difficult time attracting qualified candidates because the experienced ones are already taken.
I encourage Executive Directors and boards to read the report and discuss ways to attract and retain capable fundraising staff. Amy suggests offering more flexible hours, encouraging fundraisers to take time off and leave at 5:00, providing continuing education, giving raises, and allowing people to work from home.
One other finding in the report is 3 in 10 fundraisers have left or plan to leave the nonprofit sector all together. I've seen this happening myself and lament when seasoned development staff leave fundraising jobs for the private sector. This trend is bad news for the community. The more successful nonprofits are at raising philanthropic gifts the more resilient and successful the organization will be. The need to retain quality development staff is critical to ensuring long-term fundraising success.
Cultural experience Finally, I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a treasure trove of masterpieces in a building the size of a city block; the 9/11 Memorial; and the New York City public library. People of all ages, races and ethnicities were enjoying what each location had to offer.
At the museum, I noticed a savvy focus on earned revenue with multiple places to purchase food, snacks, and beverages as well as "mini" gift shops adjacent to temporary exhibits. The museum also offers beautiful open spaces with natural light for hanging out with friends and family.
At the 9/11 memorial, there were dedicated, knowledgeable volunteers available to answer questions which made the even more memorable. At the library, which is free of charge, I saw people including me, putting dollars in a clear donation box outside the reading room.
Each place is amazing, and despite their size and scope, offered something of value that nonprofits can emulate on smaller scale. The contribution these nonprofits make to their communities and visitors alike is immeasurable. It is another reminder that part of any community's quality of life depends on a strong, vibrant nonprofit sector.

Study: Law sharply curbs felon voting rights restoration

Texto completo: Four of five felons who would otherwise have been eligible to register to vote after passage of Amendment 4 are barred from casting a ballot because of a new state law opponents liken to a poll tax. And a disproportionate share of those would-be voters are black.
Those are the findings of a preliminary study conducted by a University of Florida professor for civil liberty groups suing Gov. Ron DeSantis after he signed into law Senate Bill 7066.
That law requires felons whose voting rights were thought to have been restored through the constitutional amendment to have paid all fines, fees and court-ordered financial restitution before they can register to vote.
The study, conducted
by UF political science Chairman Daniel A. Smith, is based on July data supplied by 48 of the state’s 67 counties and from the state Department of Corrections. The two largest counties captured in the study are Palm Beach and Orange.
The state’s two most populous counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, are not yet part of the study, which was submitted Aug. 2 as expert testimony on behalf of several groups including the ACLU of Florida and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
Smith, who has researched electoral politics for two decades, was limited by the difficulty of obtaining data statewide.
Nonetheless, he concluded that “there is little doubt that SB 7066 will severely limit the ability of eligible Floridians with a past felony conviction to be able to register to vote.”
The new law, Smith found, is particularly effective in snuffing out the voting rights of black felons.
“In my opinion, it is clear … black individuals who have otherwise met all the terms of their felony convictions are significantly less likely to be able to gain voting rights under SB 7066, as compared to similar white individuals,” Smith wrote.
Blacks twice as likely to owe
The state has no centralized, publicly available database that would allow it to know who will be affected by the fee required of the new law.
Smith used publicly available data to build such a database. He found 375,256 felons in 48 counties who were no longer in custody and who had not committed murder or a felony sex crime, meeting the broad eligibility for voting rights restoration laid out in the November 2018 constitutional amendment.
Of those, 66,108 had paid their fines, fees and court-ordered financial restitution. The remaining 309,148, about 82 percent, are barred from voting because they have not satisfied their financial obligations, the study found.
Micah Kubic, executive director of the ACLU of Florida, said the findings are “shocking, not that they are surprising.”
He added: “We had been saying that the bill would be much more sweeping in its impact than the advocates claimed. It is a travesty and a tragedy that we at the ACLU had to do this research because the state refused to do it themselves.”
Smith also found that white felons were more likely than black felons to have paid all of their fines, fees and court-ordered restitution. White felons were nearly twice as likely as black felons to owe no fines, fees or court-ordered restitution.
Most felons of both races, Smith found, owed between $500 and $5,000.
He wrote that he could not fully extrapolate his preliminary findings to the nearly 1.5 million felons estimated to be awaiting restoration of their voting rights because that larger number hasn’t been filtered for those convicted of murder or sex crimes.
But if the trends he found hold true, the number of those blocked by SB 7066 could top 1 million, he wrote.
Governor fights suit
Multiple lawsuits, including the ACLU’s suit, argue that SB 7066 is an unconstitutional poll tax that, like the infamous practice of Southern states in the aftermath of the Civil War, blocks those of limited financial means from voting.
Opponents also say it thwarts the will of Amendment 4, approved by 65 percent of Florida voters as they sought to make it easier for felons to regain the right to vote.
In signing SB 7066 into law, DeSantis said the fact that Amendment 4 restores voting rights to some violent felons without regard to the wishes of the victims is “a mistake” he would not want to compound by “bestowing blanket benefits on violent offenders.”
Lawyers for the governor have filed to have the ACLU’s suit dismissed, arguing that “state courts should say what state law is.”
DeSantis also has asked the state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on the question of whether felons must pay their fines and fees.
“The Governor has the duty to implement both the amendment and the law, which must be done appropriately,” Helen Aguirre Ferre, the governor’s director of communications, wrote in an email to The Palm Beach Post. “That is why he is asking the Florida Supreme Court to provide an opinion on this matter.”
Tight races, limited rights
The escalating legal battle will have broad political impact in a state known for paper-thin election margins.
DeSantis, for example, won his race for governor with a margin of 32,463 votes, about 0.4 percent of the 8.2 million ballots cast in the race. His predecessor, Rick Scott, was re-elected in 2014 by 64,145 votes, 1.1 percent of the nearly 6 million ballots cast.
Presidential races in Florida have also been close, and, with the state’s 29 electoral votes desperately coveted by both parties, any change in voting access here will impact the 2020 race.
The dispute already has garnered national attention, with columns and stories on the topic appearing in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.
Republicans in Florida and across the country have supported measures limiting access to the voting booth. Those measures have had a disproportionate impact on minorities, who tend to support Democrats.
In an investigation of Florida’s voting rights restoration system last year, The Palm Beach Post found that, as governor, Scott severely choked the system, making it far more difficult for felons to regain eligibility.
Scott restored the rights of twice as many whites as blacks and three times as many white men as black men. He also restored rights to a higher percentage of Republicans and a lower percentage of Democrats than any of his predecessors since 1971, The Post found.
Amendment 4 removed the governor’s arbitrary review to make it nearly automatic for most felons to regain their right to vote after serving time.
The amendment allows felons who did not commit murder or felony sex crimes to register to vote “upon completion of all terms of sentence including parole and probation.”
The amendment language says nothing about fines, fees and court-ordered financial restitution, but Republican legislators have interpreted the phrase “all terms of sentence” to include those financial obligations.
Minorities are over-represented among those who were incarcerated in the state’s prison system, and they are also over-represented among the poor, who are likely to struggle to pay the fines, fees and restitution required by SB 7066.
Democrats argue that Republicans are well aware of those realities and have crafted a series of barriers like SB 7066 that allow them to claim they aren’t targeting voters by race.
“The idea that they would be blissfully unaware of the impact of this is absurd,” Kubic said. “There is a very clear pattern that emerges, one that should not be a surprise to anyone, least of all our legislators in Tallahassee. It’s clear evidence of a racially discriminatory policy.”

'Nothing more than an opinion': Jeanine Pirro doubts medical examiner's ruling on Epstein death

Texto completo: Fox News host Jeanine Pirro doubted on her Saturday show that the medical examiner's ruling that alleged child sexual predator and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide.
Pirro, a former judge and prosecutor, argued that a medical examiner's ruling is "nothing more than an opinion," and that she has "never been wed to the medical examiner's manner of death."
“This medical examiner took extra time from Saturday to Friday since the autopsy to put the facts together and synthesize the results determine the manner of death. How do you determine the manner of death when there are no cameras, no cellmates, guard are sleeping, some of them are even refusing to cooperate. Did that medical examiner have a total picture?” she asked.

Forensic pathologist Dr. Cyril H. Wecht joined Pirro to speculate and discuss the likelihood that Epstein ended his own life.
Pirro then peppered Wecht with questions about the likelihood a person's hyoid bone would break during a hanging. Wecht explained that the hyoid bone is "fractured much more often in manual strangulation" than in hanging.
The Fox News host is not the only person to question the medical examiner's findings.
Three of Mr. Epstein’s lawyers, Martin G. Weinberg, Reid Weingarten, and Michael Miller, challenged the ruling.
“We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical examiner,” the lawyers said in a statement, according to the New York Times. “We will have a more complete response in the coming days.”

Texto completo: While white settlers were initially invited to Texas by the Mexican government to boost population growth during the early 19th century, many didn’t follow the legal requirements. They flooded in illegally, before eventually edging Mexican residents of Texas out of the territory entirely.
And though the state's borders were established during the mid-19th century, that boundary wasn’t closely enforced until more recently, according to Carlos Vélez-Ibáñez, founding director of the Arizona State University School of Transborder Studies.
Vélez-Ibáñez said southern parts of the region have always been bustling with transborder communities, such as El Paso, where the city’s residents live in a bilingual, bicultural community alongside Ciudad Juárez, Mexico.
He said that the name El Paso is actually short for “el paso del norte,” or the northern passage, adding that the Spanish coined the name because of the area’s reputation as a frequent migrant stop for northbound colonists. Last year, nearly 12. 4 million personal vehicles crossed the Paso del Norte International Bridge that separates the two cities.
Texas state Rep. Leo Pacheco, D-San Antonio, said he has the fairest skin of his eight siblings and is often seen as passing for white. He is a direct descendant of the Canary Islanders of Spain who founded San Antonio, Texas in 1731, as well as neighboring Native American tribes.
Pacheco said he always believed he was Mexican, until he conducted a genetics test to learn he was, in fact, 30. 8% Native American and 60% Iberian.
“It was more of a label that was given to us by the Anglo society,” Pacheco said of the his Mexican identity.
He said his pale skin and red hair have given him insight into the bigotry within his home state, albeit in conversations behind closed doors. Since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, this racist rhetoric has gotten worse, he said.
Many feel emboldened by Trump, who launched his presidential campaign in June 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants "rapists. " That rhetoric has persisted throughout his presidency. Last week, The New York Times reported that Trump's re-election campaign has already run more than 2,000 ads on Facebook that feature the word "invasion. "
“They’d say these things in front of me, and then have a concerned look when they’d see I wasn’t laughing,” Pacheco said. “The sentiment has been there all along, but now they think it’s okay to be racist because of our leadership. ”
He views the country's demographic changes in this region as simply a righting of what has been taken from brown people on the continent for generations. The U. S. Census Bureau has predicted that the majority of the country will be composed of current minority populations by the year 2050.
“This land was the brown people’s land to begin with,” Pacheco said. “It’s only returning to its natural state of order. ”
Patricia Perea, 43, is descended from people who lived in the Llano Estacado, a region that includes parts of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. A first-generation college graduate, Perea decided to become a lecturer in the Chicana and Chicano Studies Department at the University of New Mexico because, when she was younger, she said she felt discouraged by her teachers from learning about Mexican American and Native American history in the region.
“The thing that’s probably the most maddening is that, as Latinos or Latinx, we’re never thought of as being older members of U. S. history,” Perea said. “We’ve been here hundreds of years, so it’s frustrating to always be put in terms of immigrants. ”
According to a report released by the Pew Research Center in 2017, 34. 4% of Hispanics in the United States are immigrants, dropping from 40. 1% in 2000. Roughly 65. 6% of Hispanics in the U. S. are native-born citizens.
“Whether it’s New Mexico or any place in the Southwest, a lot of Mexican Americans, like people in my family that have been here over a few centuries, we’ve worked in communities with people who are more recently from Mexico or Central America, so a lot of us are intermarried,” Perea said.
From an early age, Charles Dominguez, 23, can recall being chastised by classmates. They told him to “go back to where (he) came from,” despite the fact that he was already there. In reality, Dominguez’s family line predates the Gadsden Purchase in Arizona.
They identify as Mexican American, a combination of the family’s past and present. As he’s gotten older, Dominguez, a student at Arizona State University, has come to cherish his family background, becoming involved in political activism for immigration and Latino issues in his home state.
“This is my home,” Dominguez said. “My family has been here for generations. ”

Are we on the verge of a recession? It's unlikely — at least this year

Texto completo: After a couple of wild weeks, with financial markets and the economy sending mixed signals, the question of the moment is: Are we on the verge of a recession?
Looking at the rest of this year, almost all forecasters say no. While the US economy is slowing, the output of goods and services should continue at a respectable clip of about 2 percent. The unemployment rate is expected to remain near a 50-year low (it was 3.7 percent in July), and a spike in inflation is on no one's radar.
But the picture is far less certain if we peer farther down the road.
In a survey released Monday by the National Association of Business Economists, 38 percent of respondents said they expected a downturn in 2020. The good news: That's a dip from 42 percent in the group's survey in February, before the Federal Reserve made clear it would ease interest rates as needed to extend the economic expansion.
The caveat: Most respondents to the survey, which was taken July 14 through Aug. 1, replied before the trade fight with China escalated. On Aug. 1, President Trump ordered tariffs on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing responded by letting the value of its currency slide against the US dollar, which was seen as a retaliatory move.
Since then, US stocks have taken a bumpy ride lower, and bond investors are acting like they consider a recession inevitable.
Still, given all the concern recently about corporate America growing cautious, it is interesting, even heartening, to see some business economists pushing back their recession forecast to 2021. Thirty-four percent of those surveyed by the NABE don't see the economy contracting until 2021, up from 25 percent in February.
“Survey respondents indicate that the expansion will be extended by the shift in monetary policy," Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG and president of the NABE, said in a statement.
In other words, the Fed's willingness to keep credit flowing — confirmed with its quarter-point rate cut on July 31 — probably keeps the economy moving forward through next year.
That would be good news for workers, management, and investors. It would also benefit Trump as he runs for reelection next year. A recession before November 2020 would seriously hurt the president's bid for a second term.
Recent economic data show manufacturing declined for two consecutive quarters, and business invesment softening.
But consumers remain confident and are continuing to spend, which is essential, since our purchases account for more than two-thirds of economic activity. In July, retail sales rose a faster-than-expected 0.7 percent.
“I think they're mainly feeling what's going on in the labor market — people are getting jobs and real wage growth is a little higher than it has been," said Megan Greene, the NABE's survey chair and a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center of Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School. “We see the same phenomenon in Germany right now. The economy is circling the drain, but if you speak to regular Germans about it they haven't noticed because unemployment is low and their standard of living hasn't suffered."
So what could trigger a recession before 2021?
The list of threats has become familiar: tariffs and the trade war; recessions in key economies such as China and the aforementioned Germany; a decision by Britain to exit the European Union without a divorce agreement. (The NABE survey found 60 percent of respondents anticipate a no-deal Brexit or a “hard Brexit," which could entail some kind of transition agreement.) And we can't rule out a shock from a military confrontation with Iran or North Korea.
“Often, a recession results when some widely held belief about the world turns out to be false," Neil Irwin of The New York Times wrote over the weekend. “In 2001, it was that a technology boom would fuel the economy and the stock market indefinitely; in 2007, it was that the housing market would never melt down across all regions at once."
These days, Irwin said, events are undercutting our belief in progress — “that the world will only become more stable and interconnected over time, and that trade, currency and diplomatic relationships can be counted upon."
That's a scary proposition. Unfortunately, it's an entirely reasonable one, too.

Learn to Explore With a Drone

Texto completo: You've got it all planned. You'll launch your drone from the grass beside the Eiffel Tower. When it reaches the top, you'll circle around the tower once, then end the video with a perfect landing. It's the kind of thing you bought a drone for. It's the kind of thing that makes for epic Instagram videos.
It's the kind of thing that's illegal and could get you fined thousands of dollars.
We're in a weird time when it comes to drones. The devices are still relatively new, but their popularity is booming, and as such many cities, companies and managerial agencies are all erring on the side of no. Their concerns are numerous, including noise issues, the potential for property damage and personal injury, and other safety concerns. That doesn't mean you shouldn't bring your drone when you travel, it means you should consider several factors before you do.
Research local laws
If there's a place you want to fly a drone, chances are someone already has and likely got in trouble for it. To avoid a similar experience, start your research with an online search of where you're going, and specifically the exact spots where you want to fly. A few places to start are Airmap.io, the Federal Aviation Administration's Where Can I Fly? and Knowbeforeyoufly.org.
DJI, the largest manufacturers of drones, also recommends some preflight research: "When traveling with your drone, it's always important to check the rules and regulations for the countries you are visiting so you are aware of what is allowed or what is not." DJI also has an interactive map that lets you select your drone and location for any alerts or restrictions.
In the example above, most of Paris is a big no-fly zone. It's safe to assume that many well-known tourist attractions, major landmarks or high-density pedestrian zones will likely be off limits. Washington, D.C., is a no-drone zone. In Britain, you're not allowed to fly within approximately 50 meters (about 164 feet) of any building, person or vehicle, or 150 meters (492 feet) from built-up or crowded areas. Japan has similar restrictions, as do many other countries. There are mix of laws in Europe currently, but one European Union-wide set of rules will be in effect starting July 2020.
If your travels are within the United States, the F.A.A. recently updated its B4UFLY app for iOS and Android. You can search locations, or it can use your current one, to see if there are any restrictions in place. Another option is the AirMap app, also on Android and iOS. This app, which shows restrictions overlaid on your location, works both in the United States and in 20 other countries, but since no app can be 100 percent accurate for all locations, always double check with a web search.
What about a permit?
Generally speaking, the more touristy a place is, the less likely you'll be able to fly a drone. You might be able to apply for a permit in advance, but often those are only available to professional drone pilots. You'll need to contact the location, or that country's civil aviation administration (For the United States, that's the F.A.A.).
In the United States, if it's near an airport or other controlled airspace, the F.A.A. has set up a program called the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability, to grant drone pilots faster authorization to fly near airports all across the country. This program is available in several apps, including AirMap.
And if you haven't already, most drones require registration with the F.A.A.
Travel-friendly options
You've done your research, you're free to fly, but which one to fly? A small, highly-portable drone might be a better option for travel. Wirecutter, The New York Times company that reviews products, recommends a few camera drones, including the DJI Tello, for around $ 100. The photos and videos produced won't be quite as high quality as their larger counterparts, but their low cost and small size make them a great option for travel.
On the plane
Drones typically use lithium ion or lithium polymer batteries, and the F.A.A. prohibits any type of spare lithium batteries in checked luggage. Batteries in a device are fine, but spare ones are not. You can bring most of those in your carry-on, however. The F.A.A. has a handy PDF to explain what's allowed and where, but check your actual airline for any additional rules.
What to expect if you get caught
Law enforcement authorities and governments of all sizes take the potential threats drones pose very seriously. Flying your drone in a national park, for instance, is classified as a misdemeanor, with a maximum fine of $ 5,000 and six months in jail.
Countries have implemented similar fines. Depending on the infraction, in Britain you could be fined between a few hundred British pounds on the spot to £2,500 (over $ 3,000). In Japan it's up to 500,000 yen, or about $ 4,700. Motherboard, part of Vice Media, used a Freedom of Information request to get a list from the F.A.A. of all the fines it has levied so far.
If your drone is confiscated by the police or local authorities, there's no guarantee you'll get it back. So it's smart to know local laws before you fly and look for any "no drone" signs, often very visible near parking lots, entrances and ticket booths.
Always consider your fellow travelers
Signe Brewster, a Wirecutter staff writer and expert in drones, wrote the Wirecutter guide referenced above. She offers one last piece of advice:
"I like to err on the side of extreme respect when flying drones. If I'm at a tourist destination and other people are within earshot, I won't fly. I wouldn't want to hear 10 drones buzzing around, so I'm not about to be the first. Never fly over crowds and always heed signs banning drones.
"Public opinion is still developing on U.A.V.s, and I want to do my part to ensure I can still be flying 10 years from now."

Texto completo: Just two months after a Lake County pastor led a "Make America Straight Again" event at a Clermont church, a grassroots advocacy group will present a Faith and Diversity Festival on Saturday, Aug. 17, in downtown Orlando.
"Faith is one of the pillars of the Puerto Rican culture and Hispanics at large," says Nancy Rosado, who together with Ricardo Negrón founded Del Ambiente, the organization presenting the festival. "We want our community to know and feel that in spite of the hateful noise made by a few, being LGBTQ+ is not mutually exclusive with celebrating one's faith."
Del Ambiente focuses on supporting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Puerto Ricans, though the Faith and Diversity Festival is open to non-Hispanics and straight allies of the gay community as well.
"Many in the LGBTQ+ communities are interested in religion and spirituality but don't know where to turn after a long history of rejection by mainstream churches," said Negrón in the festival announcement. "This festival will give them an opportunity to connect with communities of faith ready to embrace them."
Among the faith organizations represented at the festival will be Joy Metropolitan Community Church, Longwood Hills Congregational Church, Oasis Church and Iglesia Episcopal Jesús de Nazaret.
Entertainment will be provided by three notable local arts organizations. The Orlando Gay Chorus, Opera Orlando and the Orlando Choral Society will join forces to form a mass chorus that will be conducted by Grammy award-winner Jeffrey Redding. Puerto Rican singers Yaire and Lissy Estrella also will perform.
A study by the British gay-advocacy organization Stonewall found that 32 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual people, and 25 percent of transgender individuals, don't feel comfortable revealing their gender identity or sexual orientation to their faith community. Only 2 in 5 of those surveyed said their congregation was welcoming to gay, lesbian or bisexual people. Only 25 percent thought transgender worshipers were welcomed by their faith.
The Make America Straight Again event, which took place in June at Revival Baptist Church in Clermont, drew pastors from as far away as Arizona. Pastor Steven Anderson, who founded Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, established a doctrine that says "homosexuality is a sin and an abomination which God punishes with the death penalty." He also posted a video to social media after the 2016 massacre at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, saying that the "good news is that there's 50 less pedophiles in this world," according to the New York Times.
"We need to continue the dialogue we started three years ago after Pulse and give voice to the voiceless," said Myrna Maysonet, a partner with law firm Greenspoon Marder, which is sponsoring Saturday's festival.
"We will not stop advocating for diversity in all of its plurality," said Maysonet, the firm's chief diversity officer. "A vocal minority will not control our narrative."
Greenspoon Marder donated funds to build a permanent memorial for the 49 Pulse shooting victims at Orlando's historic Greenwood Cemetery and made a $60K gift on their behalf to the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
The Faith and Diversity Festival begins at 5 p.m. at Stonewall bar, 541 W. Church St. in Orlando. Festivalgoers must be 21 or older to attend.

Times Board Member and Head of M.I.T. Media Lab Apologizes for Epstein Ties

Texto completo: Joichi Ito, the director of the M.I.T. Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of The New York Times Company's board, apologized Thursday for his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, the financier whom federal prosecutors in New York charged with sex trafficking before his apparent suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan last week.
Mr. Ito, who is also a professor at M.I.T., said in a statement posted on the M.I.T. Media Lab website that he had met Mr. Epstein in 2013 through a "trusted business friend" and had allowed him to donate to the lab through foundations he controlled and invest in several of Mr. Ito's outside funds that back start-ups.
"In my fund-raising efforts for M.I.T. Media Lab, I invited him to the lab and visited several of his residences," Mr. Ito said in the statement. "I want you to know that in all of my interactions with Epstein, I was never involved in, never heard him talk about and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of."
Mr. Epstein, who was long dogged by accusations that he had sexually abused girls, pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor, five years before he and Mr. Ito met. The plea was part of a deal that is now under scrutiny.
In his statement, Mr. Ito said he took "full responsibility for my error in judgment," adding, "I am deeply sorry to the survivors, to the Media Lab and to the M.I.T. community for bringing such a person into our network."
He pledged to raise the same amount of money M.I.T. had accepted from Mr. Epstein and donate it "to nonprofits that focus on supporting survivors of trafficking." Mr. Ito added, "I will also return the money that Epstein has invested in my investment funds."
Mr. Ito did not disclose the amounts. He and M.I.T. declined to comment beyond his statement.
After Mr. Epstein served a 13-month sentence in the Palm Beach County Jail in Florida, he tried to rebuild his reputation, cultivating connections with elite academics while portraying himself to Wall Street and the news media as a philanthropist who backed cutting-edge science.
His interests often veered toward fringe concepts, such as cryonics and transhumanism, which critics have described as modern-day version of eugenics. Scientists continued to associate with him, sometimes attending dinner parties at his mansion in Manhattan or making visits to his private Caribbean island. The geneticist George Church, whose Harvard University lab accepted money from Mr. Epstein more than a decade ago, apologized this month for his "poor awareness and judgment" in an interview with the health-focused news website STAT.
The M.I.T. Media Lab started in 1985 as a research center devoted to advances in a wide variety of disciplines, including digital technology, robotics and neurobiology. It has an annual operating budget of $ 80 million, according to its website, much of it provided by "member" organizations. The companies listed on its website include Comcast, Exxon, Google, Nike, PepsiCo and Salesforce, among many others. Mr. Ito was named the lab's director in 2011.
He is also a board member at the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Since 2012, he has been a Times Company board member and serves on the audit and technology and innovation committees.

Texto completo: New York Times White House correspondent Michael D. Shear said that all parties involved in Israel's decision to bar Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were being "political from the beginning."
Shear addressed the recent controversy during a panel on CNN's Inside Politics Friday afternoon. The day before, the Israeli government announced that the two congresswomen would not be allowed to enter the country, citing a law that allows the country to forbid people who have supported calls to boycott Israel, as they have done.
Tlaib was then granted access to visit her grandmother on a "humanitarian request" after she promised not to "promote boycotts against Israel." However, she has since announced that she is not going anymore.
NYT White House reporter discusses Tlaib, Omar being banned from Israel"The sad part here is putting aside her grandmother, who is elderly, this was political from the beginning in every — on all sides and every step. It was political for the two congresswomen, who were clearly wanting to go to Israel to make a political point. That’s certainly allowed. It should be allowed," Shear stated.
"It was political for our president who wanted to send — continue to send the message that he’s been sending about casting these two congresswomen as sort of the face of the Democratic Party, and it was political for Benjamin Netanyahu, who’s got an election that he’s running and is going to come in about a month," he continued. "So everybody was acting in political ways."

President Trump reportedly wants to 'buy' Greenland. Why?

Texto completo: The Wall Street Journal broke the news Thursday evening that President Trump was interested in acquiring Greenland — a remote, semiautonomous territory that is officially part of Denmark.
Trump has reportedly asked the White House counsel to look into the idea, which has caused bafflement among Danish politicians and Greenland residents.
“We're open for business, not for sale," a tweet from the Greenland Ministry of Foreign Affairs read.
Denmark's former prime minister tweeted that it “must be an April Fool's Day joke" out of season.
“We are talking about real people and you can't just sell Greenland like an old colonial power," a Danish lawmaker told Reuters.
Indeed, while the idea seems like it came out of left field, a number of analysts have sought to discern the logic behind it. So, why Greenland?
According to multiple reports, Trump is interested in the “natural resources" of Greenland. Though its surface is 80 percent covered by ice and snow, studies have shown that as the earth warms because of climate change, a number of valuable resources will become accessible to mining.
According to the Brookings Institution, that includes “iron ore, lead, zinc, diamonds, gold, rare earth elements, uranium, and oil."
For a president who has repeatedly claimed climate change is a hoax, interest in the natural resources of Greenland is a highly unexpected position.
But members of Trump's administration have already been discussing the fallout of melting Arctic ice without acknowledging its cause. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo predicted in May “a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic" and discussed in that speech the potential of new shipping routes akin to the Panama Canal. It was a speech he delivered without ever mentioning climate change.
There are also strategic issues at play as China continues to flex its muscle as a world superpower. The United States' only military base in the Arctic Circle is located in Greenland and is responsible for missile and space surveillance, according to the trade publication Defense News.
Just last year, China made attempts to finance three airports in Greenland with the condition that they be constructed by Chinese companies, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Pentagon reportedly pressured Denmark to squash the deal and pay for the airports itself.
Of course, there's another factor at play: ego.
For a real estate developer with a penchant for putting his name on buildings, the idea of acquiring the world's largest island is an attractive one for Trump.
“People outside the White House have described purchasing Greenland as an Alaska-type acquisition for Mr. Trump's legacy," the Wall Street Journal reported.
Or, as New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Michael D. Shear put it, Trump “tends to view his presidency through the lens of acquisitions."

The defense of the free press A year after coordinated message

Texto completo: A year ago today, more than 200 newspapers across the U.S. ran editorials decrying President Donald Trump’s repeated application of the term "enemies of the people" to describe the press and reinforcing the need for a vibrant free press in a healthy democracy. There is still cause for concern.
Since that show of solidarity, the U.S. has fallen three places in Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index ranking. We’re now 48th out of 180 countries surveyed.
Data compiled by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker points to an escalation in violence: By April, there had been 10 reported attacks on journalists this year alone and 46 since 2017, including a reporter in California who was struck in the face and had her phone stolen as she interviewed voters.
It’s not just the U.S. In some places, threats against journalists are now "occupational hazards" — in Brazil, supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro have attacked members of the media both online and physically.
And President Trump continues to attack the media, revisiting the "enemy of the people" slogan in June when he accused The New York Times of a "virtual act of treason." Such attacks, whether from the president or any person in power, must be resisted.
The press is not perfect, to be sure. But to vilify the entire institution because of its imperfections poses a very real danger to America’s freedom.
In one of our first editorials on the topic in December 2016, we weren’t necessarily thinking of physical harm when we warned that the assault on the press is dangerous. We wrote: "It undermines our democracy.
"It allows those in power to say, ‘Ignore the facts no matter what the facts may be.’ "It allows partisans of both parties to say, ‘Believe in my distortions because you agree with my ideology.’ Or, ‘because you agree with my cult personality.’ "It allows anyone who screws up to say, ‘The problem’s not me; the problem’s the messenger.’ " The "enemy of the people" refrain can provide a useful political rhetorical slogan. But repeating such a slogan, a practice common among history’s strongmen, and infusing it with a tone of legitimacy is not a harmless political device.
Writer Richard Frankel described the impact in a June 9 article for Salon: "After all," he wrote, "enemies are not debated. Enemies are not reasoned with. One doesn’t compromise with an enemy. An enemy is confronted, is combated, is neutralized, and ultimately, an enemy is destroyed. The point at which politics shifts from truth to lies, from opponents to enemies, is the point at which democracy dies."
That distinction, that warning, is as important to remember today as it was a year ago.
Facts matter. Support a Free Press.

Trump’s policy on China: incoherent, values-free

Resumen: [...]it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time. When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people." What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights.

Texto completo: A concern for human rights and democracy has often been seen as an add-on to our country’s foreign policy, an attractive veneer over the usual realpolitik. But President Donald Trump is demonstrating that a supposedly "America First" policy focused entirely on trade and divorced from a commitment to our values is incoherent.
Trump is embarrassing our country — and weakening it, too — by refusing to stand with the people of Hong Kong as they struggle against China’s dictatorship.
We have long wondered when the thoughtless chaos of Trump’s presidency would finally catch up with him and endanger our country. How long could an administration that replaces policy with impulse and thinking with tweeting stay out of crisis? The disarray around Trump’s China policy and the economic turmoil it has unleashed tell us that moment is now.
Somehow, Trump seemed to think that he could be tough on China and still express his admiration for President Xi Jinping’s brutally authoritarian rule.
"He’s now president for life. President for life. And he’s great," Trump told Republican donors at a fundraising event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in early 2018. "And look, he was able to do that. I think it’s great. Maybe we’ll give that a shot some day."
So it should not surprise us that as Xi tries to put down pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong, Trump was ready to employ "the language used by Communist Party officials," as The New York Times put it, in saying on Aug. 1 that Hong Kong has had "riots for a long period of time."
"Somebody said that at some point they’re going to want to stop that," Trump added. "But that’s between Hong Kong and that’s between China, because Hong Kong is a part of China." Translation: Do what you have to do, China.
Trump underscored his indifference to democracy Tuesday on Twitter. Responding to Chinese troops gathering at the Hong Kong border, he said only: "Everyone should be calm and safe!"
This reaction is scandalous from the leader of a nation whose Constitution begins with the words: "We the People." When it came to trade negotiations, Trump blustered about imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods, sent the stock market into a tailspin, and then backed off from many of the tariffs, "just in case they might have an impact on people."
But Trump’s correction-on-the-fly may not be able to undo the damage he (and Xi) have done to the world economy. The stock market’s dive on Wednesday reflected recession fears gripping investors. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s about-face seemed motivated not by any grand strategy but by a purely selfish concern for his own re-election. "Nobody wants to run for president, on either party, in the middle of a recession," Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, told CNBC.
What’s maddening about Trump’s approach at a practical level is that many nations, including the United States’ traditional democratic allies, see China as a bad actor tearing up trade rules not to its liking and regularly violating intellectual property rights. But rather than going about the patient work of building support for what should be a broad and united front against China’s abuses, Trump’s erratic approach is making it easier for China to cast the U.S. as the heavy. This does not put the interests of America first.
And Trump’s affection for dictatorships is squandering the high ground our country has historically been able to occupy, even in the face of our imperfections and inconsistencies. Championing democracy is not simply the right thing to do. It is a strategic asset. It is also in our national interest at a time when democracy is under challenge from both China and Russia and faces nationalist threats in countries whose free institutions once seemed secure.
Our president has already done grave damage to our nation’s domestic fabric by dividing us against each other, provoking both racism and nativism, and seeking to delegitimize all who stand against him. Now, his nihilism is wreaking havoc on our economy and around the world. This is the place where a slapdash, value-free approach to governing was bound to lead us.

Iowa's King Stirs Uproar In Remarks About Rape

Texto completo: Representative Steve King of Iowa, a Republican whose history of making racist and divisive remarks led him to be stripped of his committee assignments earlier this year, questioned Wednesday if there would "be any population of the world left" if it were not for rape and incest. His comment drew swift condemnation from top House Republicans and at least one called for him to resign.
Mr. King, who represents a deeply conservative district in northwest Iowa, made the remarks to the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale, Iowa, as he explained his opposition to exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion legislation.
"It's not the baby's fault," Mr. King said, according to a video of the comments published by The Des Moines Register, which first reported the story.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled those people out that were products of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that's taken place, and whatever happened to culture after society, I know that I can't certify that I'm not a product of that. And I'd like to think every one of the lives of us are as precious as any other life."
A spokesman for Mr. King did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But House Republican leaders broke from their August recess to publicly chastise him.
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, both said Mr. King's comments underscored why he had been removed from his committees, though both stopped short of saying further action was necessary.
"This isn't the first time I've had concerns with what Steve King has said," Mr. McCarthy said on Fox News' "Special Report." "I think this just continues to show why that action was taken."
The No. 3 House Republican, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, called Mr. King's comments "appalling and bizarre" and reiterated her suggestion that he resign.
"As I've said before, it's time for him to go," she wrote on Twitter. "The people of Iowa's 4th congressional district deserve better."
Mr. King was removed from committees in January after he questioned why white supremacism was offensive. The next step, should Republicans want to further punish him, would likely be to expel him from the conference, which according to party rules would require a 2/3 vote of the members. It is unclear whether Republicans would do that.
However, during a private conference meeting in June, a proposal by one member to reinstate Mr. King on his committees drew no support from any other member of the conference, according to one person familiar with the session.
Mr. King is a politically problematic figure for the broader conference, which is trying to demonstrate inclusivity and can ill afford to let him become the face of the party at a time when its numbers of female and minority politicians are shrinking. At least two Republican women are not seeking re-election to the House, and the lone black Republican in the conference, Representative Will Hurd of Texas, has also declined to run again.
Mr. King's latest remarks come just over a week after J. D. Scholten, a Democrat who nearly defeated him in 2018, announced that he would run again for Mr. King's congressional seat in 2020. Mr. King defeated Mr. Scholten by just 10,000 votes last November. Mr. King also faces a Republican primary challenger, State Senator Randy Feenstra, who has far outraised him.
"Yet again, Steve King puts his selfish, hateful ideology above the needs of the people of Iowa's 4th district," Mr. Scholten said in a statement on Wednesday. "Excusing violence -- in any way -- is entirely unacceptable."
"His comments are disrespectful to survivors and don't reflect Iowan values," Mr. Scholten added.
Numerous Democratic presidential candidates called on Mr. King to resign.
"Steve King is a racist, a misogynist and a disgrace to the country," said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. "He should not be a member of the United States Congress."
"You are a disgrace. Resign," said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota was one of several candidates who urged donations to Mr. Scholten.
During his nine terms in Congress, Mr. King has promoted white nationalists and neo-Nazis on Twitter and frequently insulted immigrants. He once famously said that for every child of an undocumented immigrant who becomes a valedictorian, "there's another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."
[Here is a timeline of Steve King's racist remarks and divisive actions. ]
After Mr. King made his comments about white supremacy to a New York Times reporter, a number of powerful party leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, suggested he should resign, and the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution disapproving of Mr. King's statements.
Mr. King has insisted that his comments were misunderstood.
Two months later, in March, Mr. King came under scrutiny again when he said he did not "have an answer" when asked directly whether he believed a white society to be superior to a nonwhite society.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Harry Lehman is a retired government aerospace engineer and an airmail history buff, a combination that renders him uniquely qualified to make a rather startling accusation: The U.S. Postal Service has been selling a commemorative U.S. airmail T-shirt that features a Russian airplane on it.
And in case you're wondering, no, the Russians have never delivered U.S. airmail. They may read our mail, but they're not supposed to deliver it.
Harry, 76, lives in Fairfax County. His parents ran Beacon Field Airport, an air strip on Route 1 that was an emergency runway for early airmail pilots. He ordered the gray T-shirt from the USPS online store. When he received it, he immediately recognized that the plane depicted under the word "Fly!" bears a striking resemblance to the Tupolev Tu-95, a Soviet strategic bomber known in the west as the Bear.
Harry emailed the Postal Service, which insisted it was a "generic style commercial aircraft" and pointed out that the Bear doesn't have windows all along its fuselage.
Harry wrote back acknowledging that and saying the plane on the $17.95 shirt is actually a Tu-114, the civilian version of the fearsome Soviet bomber. He never got a response, so I got involved.
This is what USPS spokesman David Partenheimer wrote to me in an email:
"The T-shirt image was selected by a private third party vendor, not the U.S. Postal Service, using stock imagery and was not meant to be reflective of any specific aircraft model. The plane in the design is an interpretation of a commercial airliner. It could be the vendor was looking to use a variation of [a] stock image of a Douglas DC-4 Skymaster which actually carried U.S. Mail and was depicted on a 1946 U.S. Air Mail stamp. The Tupolev Tu-114 has nothing to do with the U.S. Postal Service. The wing shape and angle are different when comparing the two planes."
There's a lot hanging on that "it could be the vendor was looking" to use a DC-4. The USPS wouldn't let me talk to the vendor - or tell me the vendor's name - so I couldn't ask a pretty basic question: Where exactly did you get that stock art? But let me point out some points of comparison between the DC-4 and what I will call "the T-shirt plane."
The DC-4 has a relatively small tail that is rounded at the top. The T-shirt plane has a large tail that is straight at the top.
The DC-4 has wings whose leading edges stick out straight from the fuselage. The T-shirt plane has wings that are swept back.
But the main clues are the propellers on the T-shirt plane. There are quite clearly two on each engine.
"Only the Russians built a twin, counterrotating propeller airplane," said Harry, who in his 33-year career worked on such U.S. aircraft as the F-14, the F-18 and the F-35. "I bet if some of the Air Force guys and Navy aviators saw this they would go, 'You've got to be kidding me.' "
I sent the images to my father, who in his two decades in the Air Force flew multiple types of airplanes, as both an instructor pilot and a reconnaissance pilot over Vietnam.
"Yep," Dad emailed back. "Looks Russkie to me."
The Tu-114 was a famous plane in its day, the pride of the Soviet Union. Its twin turboprop engines allowed it to fly fast and far. In September 1959, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in one.
"When it touched down with a puff of blue smoke, there was a gasp of awe from the waiting crowd at its size," wrote the New York Times.
Harry finds it ironic that at a time when Russia is intent on messing with our country, the Postal Service has been selling a shirt emblazoned with a plane of our Cold War foe.
Where's the vetting?
The rest of the T-shirt doesn't engender much confidence. Under the airplane are the words "United States Post Service."
"Post," not "Postal."
What's up with that? "Regarding the phrase used on the T-shirt, this was an error and is being fixed," the Postal Service's Partenheimer wrote.
Harry said the Postal Service offered to take the shirt back and refund his money.
"I told them no way. I'm keeping this shirt," he said. "It's far from a low-end T-shirt, in terms of how it's put together. But the artwork's just bad."
Alas, if you want a USPS T-shirt with a Soviet airplane, you're out of luck. It has been removed from the Postal Service website.
Fortunately, I already ordered two: one for me, one for my dad. The Russian shirt may not be as valuable as that upside-down airplane airmail stamp, but I think it's going to be a collector's item all the same.

Ann Coulter says Trump ‘deserves to lose,’ will vote for him anyway

Texto completo: In an exclusive interview with the Washington Examiner, conservative commentator and author Ann Coulter shared her thoughts on the current political environment, including topics ranging from President Trump and the Republican National Committee to the Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Coulter began by slamming Trump for failing to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall on the southern border.
“[Trump] deserves to lose. We don’t deserve a Democrat though,” Coulter said before adding that she has “repeatedly” told Trump that he does not need Congress to build the wall. When asked what she is most satisfied with about the Trump presidency, Coulter said “the tweeting is great.”
Coulter, a former Trump supporter, recently became disenchanted with the Trump administration. She blames this in part on a “saboteur in the administration” who she says has prevented hard-line immigration hawks such as Kris Kobach from serving in the administration.
Coulter remarked:
"Kris Kobach built a wall, over Memorial Day Weekend in El Paso, a part of the border, that the Army Corp of Civil Engineers had said, ‘Nope, can’t build a wall there. Nope, it’s impossible’ … In a weekend they did it. It was the same company that built the fence around Israel. Kris Kobach did it in a weekend. Gosh, wish he were working for the Trump administration."
She later took jabs at Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for allowing the Republican National Committee to advise the Trump administration, sarcastically calling them “geniuses” and “brain trusts.” She also said the RNC has not learned the lessons of the 2016 election because it still panders to donors on immigration and believes Hispanic votes can be won by advocating for amnesty.
“[Jared and Ivanka] don’t know anything about politics,” Coulter said. "[The RNC] are the people that tried to prevent your father-in-law from becoming president.”
Coulter added that she always suspected Hispanics would support Trump more than other Republican presidential nominees such as Mitt Romney and John McCain. She told a story of how, during a Christmas party in 2015, wealthy South Florida Republican donors were shocked at Hispanic support for Trump.
She claimed they said, “I don’t understand this. We’re all for Bush. And all the Hispanic help, they’re all for Trump!”
Coulter also weighed in on deporting DACA recipients, saying that Trump and Obama are wrong to deport felons first before Dreamers, referring to those brought to the country illegally at a young age.
“I want the Dreamers [deported] first. Keep the felons, get rid of the Dreamers. Because they’re arrogant about it,” she said.
Coulter says she believes illegal immigrants wrongly demand special treatment, saying African Americans are the only group of Americans that can “boss us around” and that she should’ve entitled her book Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama as You’re Not Black.
Referring to immigrants, “You don’t get to leapfrog against Americans who have been here for 400 years,” Coulter added.
She mocked diversity and said the phrase “diversity is our strength” would be like teaching little kids to say “hitting yourself on the head with a hammer is fun!”
Coulter said she hopes a strong, “sane” Democratic candidate wins the nomination so that Trump’s fear of losing might drive him to build the wall. Additionally, she said should Trump lose, this moderate Democrat would be better than one of the far-left candidates.
At one point during the interview, Coulter took shots at Fox News for not booking her for commentary anymore. While she said she did not know the reason, Coulter also said to “call Tucker [Carlson] and ask him” why she was no longer invited as a guest.
“Maybe you can get an answer,” Coulter said. “Women were willing to have sex with O’Reilly just to be on TV. If all you have to do is say something crazy, and you can still be on TV, they’ll say anything! So yeah, if you actually say what you believe, you might not get as much TV time.”
Coulter, who previously authored 13 New York Times bestsellers, announced she won’t be writing another book. “We’re doomed. There’s no point to writing another book,” she said.
Coulter also revealed more about her ideological shift in foreign policy and trade, defending the Iraq War but pointing out how Trump’s opposition to “endless wars” and bad trade deals made her reevaluate her beliefs. She proposed new ideas during the interview, suggesting that Amazon should create a “Made in America” button for consumers to purchase domestic products so they can choose not to buy “crap” from China.
Weighing in on modern libertarianism, Coulter described libertarian individuals and groups such as the Cato Institute as “fake phony frauds.”
“They’re cat's-paws for big business,” Coulter said. “They only want to talk about things that will make liberals like them. Libertarians are p-----s.”

Hickenlooper considers dropping presidential bid and running for Senate

Texto completo: Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is considering ending his long shot presidential bid and running for the Senate instead.
Hickenlooper drove around Iowa Friday night with 2020 rival Sen. Michael Bennet to discuss the potential decision, the New York Times reported.
The deliberation about a possible bid contradicts Hickenlooper’s earlier dismissal of a possible Senate run. In February, Hickenlooper said he was “not cut out to be a senator.”
“Senators don’t build teams. Senators sit and debate in small groups, which is important, right? But I’m not sure that’s my — I’m a doer. That’s what gives me joy,” he said at the time, telling reporters that he had been approached by Democratic leaders to challenge Republican Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner in 2020.
The switch comes as Hickenlooper is unlikely to qualify for the next Democratic debates in September.
In June, several of his top campaign staffers quit after he brought in a fraction of donations compared to other candidates and failed to gain traction in the polls. Hickenlooper blamed himself for his faltering campaign.
“There’s just a bunch of skills that don’t come naturally to me,” he said, “like being a really good debater, being real smooth with wealthy donors … I’m committed to growing and working and getting better.”
Hickenlooper fares better in polls for a hypothetical Senate race in Colorado. A poll published Sunday showed he had a 51-point lead over current front-runners in the Democratic primary. Another poll found Hickenlooper leading Gardner by 13 points.

It's Pumpkin Latte Time. Well, at Dunkin' Anyway.

Texto completo: As a heat wave bears down on parts of the country, what could be better than wrapping your sweaty palms around a steaming pumpkin-flavored latte?
If that is not your idea of summer fun, take it up with the coffee and doughnut chain that now goes by the name Dunkin', which announced on Monday that it was "stepping up the seasonal celebration" by offering its fall spread almost a week earlier than last year.
Eight Dunkin' stores will be temporarily rebranded as "Pumpkin" on Wednesday. They will serve free pumpkin-flavored beverages and "Munchkins lip balm" with a pumpkin scent. Yes, you read that right.
Two new products will also be on offer: apple cider doughnuts and a signature pumpkin-flavored latte with cinnamon and sugar, clearly intended as a rival to Starbucks's popular Pumpkin Spice Latte, which may also be arriving earlier than in the past. A latte war is brewing.
Don't blame climate change for the early arrival of the gourds.
"Every year during the peak of summer our guests begin to tell us they are ready for their pumpkin fix," Dunkin' said in a statement, adding that annual sales of pumpkin-flavored products hit an all-time high in 2018.
But is it too soon? Local television and radio stations posed the question to Twitter users, with mixed results.
Some were in favor, like Allison Hopkins of Jacksonville, Fla., where temperatures were in the 90s on Tuesday. "I woke up with a distinct craving for a pumpkin spice latte and scarf season," she wrote.
But for others, it was too soon to be thinking about orange foliage, autumn walks and Halloween.
Like holiday creep, pumpkin creep is real.
In recent years, pumpkin-flavored Cheerios, cookies and candies have appeared on store shelves long before Halloween. Whether real pumpkin is actually used by manufacturers in all of these products is subject for debate. One thing is sure: Pumpkins and pumpkin spice are not the same.
A Dunkin' spokeswoman confirmed that the beverages contained no actual fruit: "Our pumpkin coffee and lattes are made with pumpkin spice flavoring similar to that used in pumpkin pie. We use real pumpkin in our seasonal baked goods, including pumpkin doughnuts and muffins."
All the marketing experts we called were on vacation, so we will remind readers what Liz Dunn, founder of Talmage Advisors, a brand strategy consulting firm, once told The New York Times: The makers of pumpkin spice products were trying to capitalize on consumers' urge to engage with and discuss limited-time offerings via social media. So it's only natural companies would try to introduce the flavor earlier each year.
"If companies can get people to do it for a longer period of time, it can only increase relevance," she said. "That's brand magic right there -- unless, of course, it backfires." She said that in 2017, so we guess that it hasn't.
Indeed, Starbucks has introduced its Pumpkin Spice Latte earlier and earlier each year since the debut in 2003.
The PSL, as it is known in pumpkin lover circles, remains the company's most popular seasonal beverage, Starbucks says. It is sold in 50 countries and has even inspired people to bathe in it.
Business Insider has been reading the tea leaves, so to speak, and spotted Starbucks employees spilling the beans on social media that pumpkin spice lattes would return on Aug. 27, the earliest date ever. The reporter even tweeted out a chart of start dates going back to 2011.
A spokesman for Starbucks declined to confirm the date.
"We're not quite ready to reveal our plans for this year," the spokesman said in an email to The Times, adding, "But if you're looking for a reason to celebrate the season, stop by your nearest grocery store and pick up one of our fall products." Pumpkin spice creamer! Pumpkin spice cookie straws!
He also suggested visiting a Facebook group hosted by the company called the Leaf Rakers Society, which is described as "a forum where we constructively work together with Mother Nature to help autumn arrive earlier in the calendar year."
Over at Dunkin', the company is wasting no time. By Aug. 21, more than a month before the autumn equinox, stores nationwide will carry the complete fall menu.
On Wednesday, outlets in eight cities, each beginning with a letter to complete the word P-U-M-P-K-I-N-', were rebranded, beginning with Providence, R.I.; Upperco, Md.; Marietta, Ga.; and ending with the Dunkin' stronghold Boston, dubiously representing the apostrophe. The full list is here.
On Tuesday around lunchtime, customers at a Dunkin' store in Midtown Manhattan were oblivious that pumpkin season was imminent. None of the nearly two dozen patrons polled had stopped in looking for pumpkin products.
"In August?" asked a man named Andrew, who lives on the Upper West Side. He ordered a cafe au lait and said he preferred his drinks without any flavoring.
Behind the counter, Christopher De Leon, who has been working at the location for about a year, confirmed that customers had indeed been known to request the pumpkin-flavored drinks in July.
Mr. De Leon said the store should offer pumpkin syrup year-round. "Just keep it," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- House Democrats, seeking to pressure the Senate Republican leadership to take up gun safety legislation, broke away from their August recess on Tuesday to appear in the Capitol with victims of gun violence, who pleaded with Congress to act swiftly to prevent further bloodshed.
Six top Democrats called on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, to bring senators back to Washington to pass two House bills: one mandating background checks on all gun purchases, including at gun shows and on the internet, and another extending the time the F.B.I. has to complete background checks.
"The time is not simply for reflection," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic leader. "The time is not for a moment of silence. The time for the Senate is to act. The time is to listen to the American people."
[Read more about mass shootings in 2019.]
Returning to Washington from their districts, the lawmakers shared stories from their constituents demanding action. Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, whose husband, John, was on the board of the National Rifle Association before his death in February, described attending a festival in her hometown in the days after mass shootings in Ohio and Texas. She said an Arab-American child approached her and asked, "Why do people hate us? Are we safe?"
"I shouldn't be answering questions of mothers of kindergartners or of children themselves about whether they are safe or hated," Ms. Dingell said, her voice rising. "We can't keep going to our corners and not figuring out what we are going to do."
On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has also been pressing Mr. McConnell to take up the House legislation and intends to formally request that the Trump administration cancel its request for $ 5 billion in border wall funding and reallocate the money for other uses, including initiatives to address gun violence and violent white supremacy, according to a senior aide to Mr. Schumer.
Gun safety has long been one of the most divisive issues in Washington, but this month's massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, have thrust it onto the congressional agenda in a way not seen since 2012, after the massacre of 26 children and staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.
Congress failed to take action in the wake of that tragedy; a bipartisan background check bill fell in the Senate in 2013. The House, now under Democratic control, passed a background check bill earlier this year, along with a bill extending the time the F.B.I. has to conduct background checks to 10 business days from three. But Mr. McConnell had refused to take up the measures because President Trump threatened to veto them.
But while Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Mr. McConnell favors expanding background checks, the leader has not committed to taking up the bill, and he has said he has no intention of bringing the Senate back early to consider it.
Mr. Trump on Sunday telephoned Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat who has been one of the leading voices in Congress for gun control, an indication that the president is interested in pursuing legislation. Earlier in the week, Mr. Murphy had contacted the White House to indicate that he was willing to work with Mr. Trump on the issue, which prompted the call.
The conversation was positive, with Mr. Trump indicating that he was serious about persuading Republicans to act, according to officials familiar with their discussion. And the two agreed to set up a staff-level dialogue this week between their offices and those of Senators Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who are working feverishly to revive the background check legislation they wrote after the Sandy Hook massacre.
The N.R.A., which opposes gun registration in any form, has for years fought against background check bills, arguing that they "don't stop criminals from getting firearms" and that some proposals "would deprive individuals of due process of law." If such a bill passed and was signed by Mr. Trump into law, it would be the first significant federal gun safety law in a quarter-century.
Tuesday's news conference comes as Democrats, including those on the presidential campaign trail, are rushing to embrace gun safety legislation and make it a campaign issue. Gun safety was a major topic of conversation at the Iowa State Fair over the weekend, which turned into a kind of contest to determine which Democrats could advance the most aggressive gun control measures.
And while House Democratic leaders are pushing for the background check bill, many Democrats are seeking to revive the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004 and had barred the purchase of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles and high-capacity magazines like the gunman used in Dayton.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called for an assault weapons ban in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Monday. On Tuesday, his campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to sign a petition asking Congress to reinstate the ban and said it already had 18,000 signatures.
The ban, though, is a nonstarter in the Senate, and even its chief sponsor, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday in an interview that the better strategy was to pressure Mr. McConnell to take action on the bills the House had already passed.
"We passed two pieces of legislation that will make a real difference, that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people," said Mr. Cicilline, who is also a member of Democratic leadership. "I think the sense is: Let's push hard to get the Senate to come into session or at least act on the two bills that we've already sent them. And then we can take up other ideas."
Polls show that roughly 90 percent of the public supports expanded background checks, but Democrats were for years skittish about pursuing gun safety legislation. With more and more mass shootings, that has begun to change.
"The biggest thing that has changed is a cultural shift with all of these shootings," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "When the mayor of Dayton said something like they were the 250th city to have a mass shooting this year, when you have all of the people that have been killed -- and not just in mass shootings, every day on the streets -- I think there is just a whole different momentum for doing something."
The political landscape is changing as well. Last year, two Democrats -- Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado and Lucy McBath of Georgia -- flipped Republican seats in swing districts after campaigning on a promise to fight gun violence. Mr. Crow is a military veteran. Ms. McBath's 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed seven years ago at a Florida gas station by a white man who complained that Jordan and his friends were playing music too loudly in their car.
"It's a false choice between the Second Amendment and responsible regulation and prevention," Mr. Crow said in an interview. "I come at this from my frame as a lifetime hunter and a gun owner. It's a false choice, it's one that we now reject. We can respect the cultural heritage of responsible gun ownership in America but also save thousands of lives."

Texto completo: Failed Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has decided against making a bid for the presidency in 2020.
Abrams will focus instead on battling voter suppression including working with background states, the New York Times reports. Her decision to focus on voter suppression follows the long-standing argument that her opponent in the gubernatorial race, Brian Kemp, won because he stifled the black vote in Georgia.
“In typical Stacey Abrams fashion, she’s taken a hard look on the best use of her time and talents are,” Lauren Groh-Wargo, a close aide to Abrams and her former campaign manager in 2018, told the Times. “And while being a pundit or running for president might have been easier, fighting voter suppression and making sure our nominees have what they need to fight on the ground is what’s most important.”
While speaking at the African American Leadership Council Summit in June, Abrams said, "We won. I realize I’m not the governor of Georgia," but later conceded, “I’m not taking the oath of office. I’m not moving into the mansion.”
She added, "They’re saying that because I didn’t get all the numbers I needed, that somehow we failed in our mission. We didn’t fail. In the state of Georgia, we transformed our electorate.”
Abrams launched two nonprofit groups recently: Fair Count, which is devoted to making sure minority communities are counted fairly in Georgia during the census, and Fair Fight Action, which is dedicated to securing voting rights for everyone.
Abrams gave the Democratic response to President Trump's State of the Union address earlier this year.

The enigmatic death of convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein over the weekend was seen as a relief to many of his powerful friends because whatever dirty secrets he knew about them are now forever buried. But they forgot one thing: If Epstein ever leaked any of these secrets to journalists on off-the-record terms in the past, they are now public knowledge.
One such lucky reporter was The New York Times ‘ James B. Stewart. In a weekly column published online Monday (in print Tuesday), Stewart disclosed previously untold details about his interview with Epstein in August 2018 concerning his business dealings with Silicon Valley’s power figures, particularly Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
SEE ALSO: No One Believes in Elon Musk’s Lofty Tesla Promises Anymore
Stewart wrote that, before booking the interview, he’d heard a rumor that Epstein was advising Musk on a crisis response strategy after Musk’s explosive tweet about taking Tesla private backfired with shareholders and the SEC. (Musk posted the tweet on August 7. Stewart interviewed Epstein on August 16.)
Stewart also said he’d heard that Epstein was compiling a list of candidates to replace Musk as Tesla’s board chairman, which later became part of the agreement under Tesla’s settlement with the SEC.
According to the journalist, Epstein acknowledged his involvement with Tesla but avoided discussing the work in detail, reasoning that “once it became public that he was advising the company, he’d have to stop doing so, because he was ‘radioactive,'” Stewart wrote. “He predicted that everyone at Tesla would deny talking to him or being his friend.”
If anything, Epstein’s prediction on how Tesla might react was acute. On Monday, Tesla’s spokesperson issued a statement to various media outlets, saying “it is incorrect to say that Epstein ever advised Elon on anything.”
Stewart had his doubts, too, writing, “It seemed clear Mr. Epstein had embellished his role in the Tesla situation to enhance his own importance and gain attention.”
But one thing Epstein said about Tesla seemed to be in line with what we know happened in the fallout of Musk’s “go-private” tweet.
According to Stewart, Epstein said during their meeting that “he’d spoken to the Saudis about possibly investing in Tesla,” adding that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was a close friend. (Epstein had a photo of himself with the crown prince displayed at his Manhattan house.)
Because the privatization plan Musk proposed at the time would cost nearly $80 billion, a significant premium over Tesla’s market value, there were only a few qualified investors out there for him to seek money from. In a blog post dated August 13, 2018, Musk suggested that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), was a possible buyer.
A Bloomberg report a day earlier said PIF was indeed in talks with Tesla about a deal.
It never materialized to anything, as we know now, with Musk eventually deciding to move past that troubling privatization plan and to keep Tesla public.

China Wages a Manipulated Information War Against Demonstrators

Texto completo: BEIJING -- When a projectile struck a Hong Kong woman in the eye this week as protesters clashed with the police, China responded quickly: Its state television network reported that the woman had been injured not by one of the police's bean bag rounds, but by a protester.
The network's website went further: It posted what it said was a photo of the woman counting out cash on a Hong Kong sidewalk -- insinuating, as Chinese reports have claimed before, that the protesters are merely paid provocateurs.
The assertion was more than just spin or fake news. The Communist Party exerts overwhelming control over media content inside China's so-called Great Firewall, and it is now using it as a cudgel in an information war over the protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for months.
In recent days, China has more aggressively stirred up nationalist and anti-Western sentiment using state and social media, and it has manipulated the context of images and videos to undermine the protesters. Chinese officials have begun branding the demonstrations as a prelude to terrorism.
The result, both in mainland China and abroad, has been to create an alternate version of what, seen from Hong Kong, is clearly a popular demonstration movement. In China's version, a small, violent gang of protesters, unsupported by residents and provoked by foreign agents, is running rampant, calling for Hong Kong's independence and tearing China apart.
This narrative almost certainly reflects that of the country's leaders, including Xi Jinping, and it is fueling misunderstanding -- and, increasingly, anger -- among the Chinese public. That could, in turn, raise pressure on the government, increasing the risk of an overreaction or miscalculation based on limited or inaccurate information.
People posting on Weibo, a Chinese social media service similar to Twitter, are increasingly calling for Beijing to act. "Beating them to a pulp is not enough," one person said about protesters on Tuesday, echoing an increasingly common sentiment on Weibo. "They must be beaten to death. Just send a few tanks over to clean them up."
Since China's censors have the ability to quickly remove offending comments, the abundance of them suggests that the government is willing to tolerate the warning they deliver, however ominous it sounds.
China has long curated the content that it allows its citizens to see and read. Its new campaign has echoes of tactics used by other countries, principally Russia, to inundate domestic and international audiences with bursts of information, propaganda and, in some cases, outright disinformation.
"Propagandists observe each other across borders, and they learn from each other," said Peter Pomerantsev, the author of "This is Not Propaganda," a new book that describes how authoritarian governments have weaponized social media that were once hailed as harbingers for democratic ideals.
The disinformation has clearly been aimed at undermining sympathy for the Hong Kong protesters' goals, which now include demands for greater democratic freedoms for the territory's seven million residents.
Propaganda in the traditional sense, Mr. Pomerantsev said, would try to win over an audience, while disinformation is meant simply to sow confusion and fuel conspiracies.
"You have to smother everything with doubt, and conspiracy is very effective in creating that," Mr. Pomerantsev said in a telephone interview.
Though China's disinformation network has received less global attention than Russia's, the country's officials have, over the last decade, built a machinery of online controls that far exceed any other country's.
Many overseas websites are blocked in China. Censors embedded within its internet companies delete anything unacceptable. The police have arrested people who speak out of turn in chat groups, or who share sensitive content online.
The state media -- whose history of propagandizing stretches back to Mao Zedong's era -- have also made powerful inroads in the new media online, filling the mainland's information vacuum with an officially Sinicized worldview.
Hong Kong, which Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997, remains outside China's firewall, and thus is sitting along one of the world's most profound online divides. Preserving the city's freedom to live without the mainland's controls has become one of the causes now motivating the protests.
"Deep inside, mainlanders and Hong Kong people have very different life experiences and emotions," said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor of journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "Without the shared emotions, it's not easy for mainlanders -- even those who can freely access information -- to empathize with Hong Kong people, which is an important explanation for how the government has been able to create a parallel universe of narratives."
China's new aggressiveness in the effort represents a shift in tactics. When large protests erupted in June over the Hong Kong government's proposed law allowing the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland, China's state media -- and officials -- largely ignored them.
That changed on July 1, when protesters stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council building after a day of peaceful demonstrations. A flurry of articles and editorials in China's state media followed, condemning the vandalism and violence -- without explaining what the protesters were protesting about.
Since then, the state media have vigorously defended the police in Hong Kong, belittled the protesters and accused Westerners of orchestrating the turmoil. Efforts to contextualize the situation or express sympathy for the protesters were swiftly purged from social media.
The propaganda campaign intensified after July 21, when protesters surrounded the Chinese government's main office in Hong Kong and threw black ink on a government emblem. And when a Chinese flag was thrown into Victoria Harbor on Aug. 3, the reaction in China -- at least online, stoked by state media -- reached a fevered pitch.
"The five-star flag has 1.4 billion guardians," CCTV wrote indignantly to its 87 million followers on Weibo. "Repost! 'I am a guardian of the flag!' "
It was reposted by more than 10 million people, including Jackie Chan, the Hong Kong martial arts film star. On Twitter, which is banned in China, the People's Daily later reposted CCTV's original post, giving it an international audience.
Just across the border from Hong Kong, in the city of Shenzhen, the Chinese security forces have conducted large-scale operations in recent days, in a nationalistic display that got prominent coverage in the state media.
Other media reports have been outright deceptive. A video appeared on Monday showing a protester with a toy weapon used in Airsoft -- a Paintball-like game that is popular in Hong Kong. The China Daily, a newspaper of the Communist Party, circulated it widely as evidence that the protesters had taken up arms, identifying the toy as an M320 grenade launcher used by the United States Army.
"What is the difference between this and the terrorists!" read one reply. "How long must we tolerate this?"
"What Is America Up To?" has become a hashtag promoted by CCTV on social media, according to Manya Koetse, the editor of What's On Weibo, a site that monitors trends on the platform. Other posts celebrate the Hong Kong police as embattled heroes, while Hong Kong residents are regularly portrayed as spoiled.
The yawning power imbalance, from an information-warfare point of view, has frustrated many protesters as they try to outline their demands and clarify what has actually happened in the streets.
During a peaceful sit-in at Hong Kong's airport late last month, protesters sought to explain their demands to arriving passengers, including travelers from the mainland. But the Chinese media promoted a video of a few protesters harassing a white-haired traveler who had ripped a poster out of a demonstrator's hands.
"Witness said the old man refused to take leaflet demonstrators gave out. I think old people don't deserve this no matter what is the reason," the editor of The Global Times, Hu Xijin, wrote on Twitter, with a video that only showed protesters confronting the man.
"These young people have lost all compassion for political frenzy," he added.

Texto completo: More than two dozen activists gathered in Foley Square on Monday calling for federal action to stem the flow of illegal guns.
Five hundred and twenty one people were shot in New York City this year as of July 28 - up from 501 people in the same time last year, The New York Times reported.
At Monday's rally, Harlem Mothers S.A.V.E. co-founder Jackie Rowe-Adams called those statistics "out of control" and said illegal guns were largely to blame.
Her group works to combat gun violence and support those who have been affected by it. Rowe-Adams lost two sons to gun violence, according to the group's website.
"Today we stand here saying, 'our children are under attack,'" she said. "Enough is enough."
Rowe-Adams and other activists hope to see the repeal of the Tiahrt Amendment - which keeps "the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from sharing its firearms-tracking database with anyone outside of law enforcement," according to the Times.
They also want to see the repeal of the Dickey Amendment, which states that funding given to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent injuries can't be used "to advocate for or promote gun control," per NPR.
Assemb. Inez Dickens, whose district includes parts of Harlem, called for federal legislation targeting the spread of illegal guns.
"Right now, you could go on any block in Harlem, practically, and purchase a gun," she maintained. "There's no need for a young person, or anyone, to be able to purchase a gun on the street."
City Comptroller Scott Stringer, meanwhile, said the Trump administration, backed by the NRA, was "hellbent on putting guns in the wrong hands."
"When I wake up in the morning, when I know my kids are in school, the worst nightmare I have is that somebody's going to call and say, 'shots fired,'" he said. "We have got to start investing in our community and investing in our children."
In his own address at the rally, which came just over a week after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, State Sen. Robert Jackson (D-Washington Heights) denounced gun violence as "a continuous action that's killing our community."
"Not only the black community, the Latino community, all communities. It's killing all of us. And we must stop it," he said. "Those individuals as legislators that do not want to take action - vote 'em out."

Texto completo: Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado recently made a pitch on Twitter that a lot of voters across America might find persuasive: “If you elect me president, I promise you won’t have to think about me for 2 weeks at a time. I’ll do my job watching out for North Korea and ending this trade war. So you can go raise your kids and live your lives. ”
Alas for Bennet, and perhaps all of us, he has not electrified the electorate. In fact, he’s at . 3% in the Real Clear Politics average of South Carolina primary polls and invisible — as in, doesn’t even register — in the six other states and national polling RCP is tracking.
What worries me is that the third of Democrats who support former Vice President Joe Biden may believe he will be a similarly stabilizing force: someone who will quietly take care of business and not force Americans to think and fret constantly about their commander in chief.
They need to take the blinders off.
Who's mentally unfit to be president?
Maybe the nonstop gaffes of the past few days will help in that process. In quick succession Biden mixed up a URL and a text address (sending people to a dead website); said “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” (accidentally injecting a racial element before adding “wealthy kids”); referred to shootings in Houston and Michigan (before correcting the locations to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio); and said he was vice president last year when the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, occurred (he left office in January 2017).
“Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are 'playing’ in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn’t have a clue!” President Donald Trump tweeted of Biden on Saturday night. Does anybody really believe this is not a preview of the campaign if Biden were to win the Democratic nomination?
Trump is, of course, the real person without a clue of how to play in the big complicated world. While Biden was making verbal slips and mostly cleaning them up as he went along, Trump was advertising his cluelessness about North Korea to the whole world on Twitter. (“A small apology for testing the short range missiles”? And to make it stop, all we need to do is stop military exercises with South Korea? OK, then, sounds good!)
This is the classic Trump projection playbook. Remember when Hillary Clinton called him Russian President Vladimir Putin’s puppet? “No, you’re the puppet,” he said, and his devotees believed it.
Trump's North Korea and Biden tweets accounted for only three of his 13 tweets Saturday. Others castigated "Fake News" the "seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media," the "corrupt" press, "wacko" comedian Bill Maher, "totally incapable" former aide Anthony Scaramucci, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman and China (ripping off America). Oh, and notable even amid that stream of invective, there was the retweet of a conspiracy theorist trying to tie Bill Clinton to Jeffrey Epstein's death in prison. From a president! And all on one day!
A nerve-wracking nominee
In a one-on-one race, Trump would have endless attack fodder that mirrors his own far more serious flaws and could help neutralize them, from Biden’s insensitive handling of the Anita Hill hearing in 1991 (to counter Trump’s women problem), to his verbal slips (to undercut the problems of Trump's own word salad and limited, repetitive vocabulary), to Biden's tendency to tell voters that if they like their private or employer-based health insurance, they can keep it (recalling President Barack Obama's utterly unrealistic promise that PolitiFact named lie of the year in 2013 — and which Trump could use to divert from his own constant lies).
Too much of a good thing: Here’s my plan for Democrats to beat Donald Trump — try having fewer plans
Biden would bring administrative experience to the government (among his other vice presidential responsibilities, he successfully oversaw the distribution of nearly $800 billion in stimulus money), not to mention a heart in the right place. His likability is off the charts, and he certainly understands the threat Trump poses to America's identity, values and future.
But he is not Obama. It would be a nerve-wracking campaign for Democrats, and if he won, a Biden presidency would not be all balm. Could Democrats relax if they were always worrying about what he would say next? And that's not even counting the millions of voters who would be on edge about Biden possibly giving away the store to his good friend in the Senate, Mitch McConnell.
Don't wallow in nostalgia
After both Biden and Trump messed up the sites of the shootings (Trump placed the Dayton tragedy in Toledo), one tweeter pleaded with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to take the wheel. She’s not that much younger than Biden and Trump, but she exudes capability. This is a woman who dreamed up and then set up a large government agency (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau). Now she has an important plan to rebuild the State Department and our diplomatic corps (seriously, our government is going to be in shambles by the time Trump leaves and we’ll need to rebuild everything, not just State).
No deals until Dems run the table: Republicans are eating our lunch. I want a 2020 Democrat tough enough to eat theirs.
Of course, Warren also exudes big, expensive liberal plans and a professorial intensity that turns some people off. She's not a perfect candidate by any means, and neither is any other Democrat. It is a tall order, trying to find someone who is both tough enough to take on Trump and low-key enough to calm a roiled nation. Maybe Democrats should be looking at a ticket that includes one of each.
Should Biden be on it? Democrats should weigh that decision carefully, and make it based not on warm nostalgia but on cold calculation.

Professor Tried To Forcibly End Student Sit-In. Now He's Gone.

Texto completo: Shortly after midnight on May 8, a man slipped into an administration building at Johns Hopkins University with a pair of bolt cutters. In a dark stairwell, he got to work, sweating through his shirt as he struggled to cut through the metal chains attached to a first-floor door.
The man was a professor at the university, and he was trying to wrest the building from student protesters who had occupied it for more than a month. Before long, the students ejected the professor, Daniel Povey, 43, from the building.
This week, Johns Hopkins kicked him off the faculty, too. His firing will be effective at the end of the month, according to a copy of the termination letter, which Mr. Povey posted on his website along with a 2,200-word retort.
Andrew S. Douglas, the vice dean for faculty, wrote in the letter that Mr. Povey, an assistant research professor in the Whiting School of Engineering, had "endangered the university community" by forcibly entering the building after the university had told him not to.
Students and their supporters occupied Garland Hall for 34 days in protest of a proposed private campus police force and contracts the university has with federal immigration authorities.
Mr. Povey wrote on his website that the students had scratched him as they took him out of the building. He also wrote that he faced more serious consequences than the students -- who he noted had also entered the building without permission -- because Johns Hopkins feared being accused of racism. He said he had tried to take the building back from the students in part because a computer server that hosted his research was inside and malfunctioning.
Hours after Mr. Povey tried to get into Garland Hall, the police cleared the building and arrested seven protesters, but the city's top prosecutor later dropped all charges against them.
Mr. Povey, who specialized in speech recognition, said he believed he could not receive a fair hearing at the university because he was white and many of the protesters were black or transgender.
White men, Mr. Povey wrote, are expected to care about every demographic group except for their own, "like a neutered puppy-dog or some Justin Trudeau man-child."
In an email to The New York Times on Saturday, Mr. Povey said he had accepted a new job at Facebook in Seattle but expected he would be fired.
"I fully expect to get fired from Facebook too as a consequence of the publicity around this, but I can line up other options," he said.
The mood was tense inside Garland Hall that night in May. Protesters had locked university officials out of the building, and administrators had offered students amnesty if they left. Students heard rumors that the police were planning to raid the building early in the morning.
Then, at about 12:30 a.m., they saw Mr. Povey walking toward the brick building with bolt cutters, flanked by six other people whom he has declined to identify to the university.
"It was pretty terrifying to see him at the top of the stairs and not know who he is," said Andrea Fraser, 27, a graduate student who joined the sit-in. "Our first question was, 'Who are you?"'
Protesters said Mr. Povey grabbed a student's hair and another student's arm after making his way into an entryway to try to cut the chains on an interior door. One of the men who students said arrived with Mr. Povey can be seen punching a protester in a video taken by sit-in supporters.
Vikram Chandrashekhar, 24, the graduate student who was punched, said students did not know that the man with the bolt cutters was a professor until after he had left.
"It was a shock, to say the least," he said.
Asked about the firing, Jill Rosen, a Johns Hopkins spokeswoman, said the university could not comment on an individual case, but that a "troubling incident" in early May had led to an investigation.
"Based on the undisputed facts of the case, the University took interim and now permanent action to ensure the safety and well-being of the community," Ms. Rosen said.
Johns Hopkins's Office of Institutional Equity is continuing to investigate claims that Mr. Povey was violent, was "motivated by racially discriminatory animus and created a hostile environment," according to Mr. Douglas, the vice dean for faculty.
Mr. Povey said he did not want his position to be misrepresented. He said he does not believe white people are always discriminated against all the time, just "specifically in the context of university campus politics and protests."
"I may have a much easier time hailing a taxi, for instance," he said.

Your baby boomer report card

Texto completo: If there's one thing young adults can agree on, it is that baby boomers have ruined the world. This seems a tad harsh. So maybe it's time for a resentment-free assessment of the boomers, conducted by a trained pop sociologist with no ax to grind.
What follows is a report card of a generation. And we're only counting real boomers here - those who had youthful, live experience of events like Vietnam and Woodstock. Despite what the Census Bureau people say, those born after 1960, like Barack Obama, don't count.
Politics | C- |
The baby boomer political era began in 1992, with the election of Bill Clinton. In the five years before that, these leaders dominated world politics: Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, Nelson Mandela, John Paul II, Helmut Kohl and François Mitterrand.
Baby boomers have been unable to match that level of talent. During the years of boomer dominance - from Bill Clinton through Donald Trump - America's political institutions have become dysfunctional, civic debate has crumbled, debt has soared and few major pieces of legislation have passed.
Social Movements | A |
Boomers are bad at politics because they distrust institutions. But this has made them good at leading decentralized social movements: environmental, feminist, civil rights, LGBTQ rights.
One lesson of the age is that when all media are focused on left-wing, elite-approved movements, it's important to notice the people quietly reacting against them. The right-leaning boomer movements are just as important: the conservative movement, the religious right, the Tea Party movement, the pro-life and gun rights movements, the populist revolt.
Popular Culture | A |
It makes sense that a generation raised on rock 'n' roll and TV would put its energy into popular culture. The boomer generation has produced a string of greats who can withstand comparison with members of any other generation: Steven Spielberg, Meryl Streep, Stephen King, Jimi Hendrix, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Oprah, Ron Howard, Madonna, Stevie Wonder and on and on.
High Culture | C- |
The boomers entered college just as universities were expanding and becoming more specialized and professionalized. This produced the most educated generation up to that time, but the specialization and ghettoization of intellectual and artistic life took its toll on the nation's culture.
It's not that people aren't producing good work, but its influence tends to be confined to the academy or specialized subcultures. Art, classical music and novels have lost cultural influence. Boomer writers do not play the same roles as Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Maya Angelou, Thomas Pynchon, Philip Larkin, John Updike and Toni Morrison. Many of the most influential living philosophers are pre-boomer - like Amartya Sen, Charles Taylor and Alasdair MacIntyre.
Technology and Innovation | A- |
A person who was born in 1900 and died in 1970 grew up with horse-drawn carriages and died with a man on the moon. Today's 70-year-olds have not seen technological change on the same order.
But they've seen a lot. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. Teams led by Francis Collins and Craig Venter decoded the genetic sequence. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak are among a great cloud of boomer tech innovators. Robert Jarvik, who developed the implantable heart, stands in for all those doing amazing work in medical innovation.
Lifestyle | A |
This isn't even close. Restaurants are much better now. Products and buildings are designed in more interesting ways. Coffee, ice cream and all else is far more varied and delicious.
Manners and Morals | C |
In the realm of manners, boomers brought on the triumph of the casual. Everything that was refined, stuffy, formal and stiff was loosened up by the boomers, and this is very good.
In the realm of morals, things are more complicated. If the ethos of the silent generation was "We're all in this together" and the code was self-effacement ("I'm nobody better than anybody else, but nobody's better than me"), then the ethos of the boomers is "I'm free to be myself" and the code is "Do you see how special I am?"
Personal freedom has been the master trend for this generation. That was a legitimate reaction against conformity. On the other hand, there is more isolation, bitterness and division. The ethos of the meritocracy filled the values void left by the retreat of any shared moral vocabulary.
Overall Grade | B |
As a generation, boomers have excelled at the material things that make life pleasant, convenient, long and fun. They have struggled in the realms that other civilizations would have considered more profound: governance, philosophy, art and public morality.
Special Bonus Question: Who is the quintessential boomer and what does he or she say about the generation?
Here are the nominees:
- Bill Clinton: Hugely talented, high achieving, sometimes self-indulgent.
- Steve Jobs: Design genius; lacked some interpersonal skills.
- Madonna: Scraped her way to the top; became the emblem of self-reinvention.
- Bob Dylan: Entered the stage with a burst of genius that seemed as if it was going to change everything, but somehow didn't.
- Steven Spielberg: Preserved human values in an age of technology; looked back admiringly to earlier generations.
- Donald Trump.

Texto completo: For the Valley News
Here at the West Lebanon Institute for Observation of Animal Behaviors and Hijinks — WLIOABH — we are closely monitoring developments in the so-called natural world.
If you have not been following oddball news lately, perhaps because there is so much of it, you may have missed a string of out-of-the-ordinary stories related to Mother Nature.
Close to home, the Valley News reported in May that Mink the black bear, who was banished to near the Canada border last summer after she and her cubs became habituated to human goodies, had returned after a remarkable overland odyssey to Hanover. 
She was seen weeks earlier in Pomfret and Woodstock, but perhaps found Vermont not to her liking. It’s not known if she was put off by the soil being too hard or too soft, excessive liberalism, or some other factor. 
According to data from a tracking collar, Mink meandered thousands of looping miles, along the way dropping 35 pounds to a svelte 165. She covered some 30 miles a day, without the treats the bears savored in Hanover — bird seed and doughnuts. If wildlife officials hadn’t intervened, she may well have worked her way up the food chain to tacos, macaroni and cheese, gluten-free foods and oat milk, possibly over porridge.
If she was a Kardashian, she would already have a best-selling diet featured in infomercials. Imagine the human testimonials. “It was easy as one, two, three. I simply avoided bird seed and doughnuts, and strolled 30 miles a day. I enjoyed all the oats, berries, grass, insects and larvae I could eat. Plus sensible portions of fish, meat and carrion. The Mink Diet worked for me!” 
Farther afield, The New York Times reported in June on an upsurge in wasp colonies in Alabama that “can grow to be as big as a Volkswagen Beetle and can have 15,000 wasps.” There haven’t been sufficient deep freezes in winter lately to cut them down to size. You may not believe in climate change, but 15,000 wasps might get your attention.
We wonder if something big is afoot in Alabama, which admittedly has not had our full sympathies since 1861. Is it experiencing a natural phenomenon, or “righteous retribution” directed by a higher power? 
Alabamians surely believe in the latter, if it’s directed at someone else.
Last weekend scientists said there had been more than 150 great white shark sightings off the Massachusetts coast since June 1. Experts say warmer ocean temperatures may be a factor, and reassuringly contend that the sharks are hunting seals, not humans. One scientist recommended that people stay close to shore and “steer clear’’ from seals. 
We at the West Lebanon Institute for Observation of Animal Behaviors and Hijinks concur. Nothing good comes from palling around with seals, despite their vocalizations that one source described as short barks, tonal honks, grunts, growls, roars and moans. That would seem to make them perfect companions at certain tailgating events and in the wee hours at frat parties. But don’t be fooled: Seals are natural freeloaders, and do not have your back — unless your back is lathered in fish oil.
Drawing less scientific interest this summer is the population of local squirrels, which boomed last year, leading to the Great Squirrel Massacre on local roads. Authorities attributed the squirrel boom to abundant food supplies in the previous growing season, which made squirrels fat and happy and, we might add, romantic! 
This summer squirrels seem more scarce, though few humans fret about the fate of the jittery scampering rodents. As far as we know, there are no Friends of Squirrels organizations about. No one uses fake orange vests to bring comfort squirrels into shops and markets. 
This illustrates the selective empathy of humans who, after all, are animals themselves and no strangers to unorthodox behaviors. Consider the “Florida man” stories. They are forever falling naked through ceilings into liquor stores during half-baked break-ins. Because it’s Florida this is, like visiting Disney World, a four-season activity.
Esquire found these headlines just in January:
Florida Man Finds a WWII Grenade, Places It in His Truck, Drives to Taco Bell.
Florida Man Who Drove Ferrari Into Water Said, ‘Jesus Told Him To.’
Florida Man Learns Hard Way He Stole Laxatives, Not Opioids.
To the extent that we each have some “Florida man’’ inside us, we should not doubt that we are subject to natural (and perhaps unnatural) forces we don’t understand. 
Indeed, human animals are jumpy as squirrels and slippery as seals, can maraud like bears and ravage like sharks. Our politics resemble the swollen angry wasp nests of Alabama.
All this calls for close watching, but sometimes when it concerns humans we at the West Lebanon Institute for Observation of Animal Behaviors and Hijinks simply have to look away.

Texto completo: The giraffe is Gianna Marino’s favorite animal to illustrate, so life is especially grand right now that she has two recently-published children’s books with the tallest animal on earth gazing out from the covers.
Having her drawings paired with the words of a power-packed name like Chelsea Clinton, who grew up in the White House and has previously penned best-selling children’s books, gave “Don’t Let Them Disappear” an almost immediate hop to the fourth spot on the New York Times Children’s Picture Books bestseller list last month.
“Just Like My Brother,” the 13th children’s book Marino has both written and illustrated, has only been out two weeks and already shows promise of popularity, but Marino doesn’t focus on sales. Although book proceeds afford the Sonoma resident a lovely livelihood, Marino’s passion is to bring smiles to young faces and encourage learning.
“I want to work on books that inspire little readers to keep on reading,” she said.
Marino and Clinton are both published by imprints of Penguin Random House, and when Clinton’s copy for “Don’t Let Them Disappear” arrived it was an editor there who suggested that Marino illustrate the book on endangered animals. All of Marino’s books feature animals, and Clinton agreed that Marino’s illustrations of giant pandas, polar bears and orangutans would make her words come alive.
The two have met only twice. The first time was more than a year ago when Marino was at work on the illustrations and Clinton was in San Francisco promoting a different project. It seemed so appropriate that they had tea at the Ritz-Carlton, where Marino recalls that she immediately felt “like I was having tea with a friend. Chelsea is kind and funny, well spoken and easy to know.”
Earlier this month Marino attended a book reading and signing event with Clinton at the San Jose Women’s Club. “People love Chelsea, she has a huge following,” Marina said of the sold-out event where she signed more than 600 books alongside the only child of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Chelsea Clinton, who is expecting her third child with husband Marc Mezvinsky, wanted to get a message out to all children that some animals need protection. The book tells the stories of 12 endangered species, each section ending with the words “Don’t let them disappear.”
“If I was a kid I’d be freaking out right now,” Marino said, explaining that with the dangers of climate change it is the current children who will be faced finding answers. “Kids are going to be the next ones in charge, and this book inspires them to take a stand, to ask what we can do to save the animals and the environment.”
Marino has been an animal lover all her life, describing herself as being a very shy child. “I wouldn’t talk. I just drew pictures all day,” said the now-chatty illustrator with long, dark curly hair. She mostly drew animals, always starting off with a circle. She grew up in San Francisco, where she loved riding horses in Golden Gate Park.
After high school she began studying to be an architect, soon realizing she was not suited to the structure and precision required. She started traveling extensively, first all over Africa then Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar. Everywhere she went she would draw what she saw, especially the animals. When in the Bay Area she always had creative jobs, once working as a muralist and eventually drawing toy prototypes for Galoop Toys.
Then she would return, studying at several Bay Area universities and working, and then be off again on another adventure. She eventually took a UC Berkeley extension class on children’s books and found her niche. A book she wrote and illustrated while taking the class, “Zoopa,” was published by Chronicle Books in 2005. Chronicle published her second book and then declined her third. She was devastated.
When her mother passed away, she was inspired to write “Meet Me at the Moon,” about a Mama elephant and her Little One. “Mama, you told me you’d meet me at the moon, but how can I reach it?” is a poignant line from the story, where the Little One eventually sees the Mama as the moon touches the horizon.
That book, which was published in 2012 and led to a three-book contract, “took off like crazy,” Marino said, quickly selling 60,000 copies and still in print. It was chosen for distribution by Dolly Parton’s foundation, the Imagination Library, which provides free books for underprivileged children, and there are now more than a million copies floating around in the world.
Marino’s stories tend to be about family relationships. Her current book was written for her brother, who lost his Paradise home in the Camp fire. Her next book comes from the sense of community that took place during the Sonoma 2017 wildfires, and will be called “Through the Eyes of a Deer.”
She can’t choose which of her books is her favorite, but says she loves “Night Animals,” about nocturnal animals that are afraid of the dark, because of the way children always laugh when she reads it to them. It was chosen for distribution by the Scholastic Book Club, and Marino just finished its sequel, “Night Animals Need Sleep, Too,” which is now in production.
Marino, 51, lives with her boyfriend and dog, and keeps her horse in Glen Ellen. She clearly knows how to reach children’s hearts. “I love kids but I never wanted them. I love traveling and I’m a little bit of a 5-year-old myself. So I am Auntie G to a lot of other people’s kids.”
Recent trips have taken her to Ecuador and Costa Rica. “I loved Mongolia, and I want to see Antarctica before it melts away.” She recently added a freestanding art studio to her wooded property, with white walls and perfectly placed windows to illuminate her illustrations as she works, usually eight hours a day, most days. It seems like a dream job, and she exudes appreciation, but she says it does have stresses and deadlines and “a lot of time alone.”
Her mind is full of stories and the images that tell them and she knows she will be sharing them forever.

His canine novel races into theaters; Garth Stein on seeing his book -- and his beloved narrator-dog Enzo-- get the full Disney treatment.

Texto completo: When Garth Stein published his third novel, "The Art of Racing in the Rain," he likely didn't anticipate the book would land on the New York Times bestseller list -- and stay there for three years.
And he never imagined that Kevin Costner would one day provide the voice of the book's narrator -- a dog named Enzo -- in a Disney movie adaptation opening this weekend.
"Nope! I did not see that one coming," Stein says of connecting with Costner. "But he's great!"

A Los Angeles native who now lives in Seattle, Stein started his career as a documentary producer. He made his literary debut in 1998 with the thriller "Raven Stole the Moon," and followed up seven years later with the novel "How Evan Broke His Head and Other Secrets."
Both novels gained positive reviews from critics, but neither prepared him for the breakout success of "The Art of Racing in the Rain," which quickly became a publishing phenomenon. The novel follows a mutt named Enzo (in the movie, he's a golden retriever) who reflects on his life with Denny Swift, the race car driver who's been his constant companion for years. The book was inspired by Stein's own love of dogs and his hobby of racing cars (from which he retired after crashing in -- wait for it -- the rain).
Stein has published a middle-grade adaptation of the novel, "Racing in the Rain: My Life as a Dog," as well as a series of children's picture books featuring Enzo. His latest novel for adults, "A Sudden Light," was published in 2014.
Director Simon Curtis' film adaptation of the novel, also starring Milo Ventimiglia and Amanda Seyfried, opens nationwide on Friday. In an interview, Stein talked about taking his book to the big screen and what's he's working on next.
--
What were your experiences on set? I took my family up to Vancouver to visit for a day, and you can find me and my sons in the background of a pit stop scene, if you look closely. I also was at Pacific Raceways near Seattle for some of the racing sequences. It's a lot of fun to visit a big Hollywood set -- lots of crew and extras and equipment. My sons (23, 20, and 12) don't get impressed by much, but they were impressed that their old man's book was being made into a movie!
--
Did your background in film help you better understand the process of adapting your book into film? Not really. I made documentary films, so that doesn't really translate to Hollywood. However, my background in storytelling helped me better understand the process. I know that changes have to be made when you take a 360-page book and turn it into a 93-minute movie. My hope was that the film would have its heart in the right place, and it certainly does.
--
Who's the better looking "Art of Racing in the Rain" star: Milo Ventimiglia, Kevin Costner or Parker the dog? I don't pick my favorite kid. I don't pick my favorite book. And I don't pick my favorite star in the movie. And anyway, I would pick Amanda Seyfried if I had to pick one!
--
What are you working on now? I've got a graphic novel coming out next summer called "The Cloven," and I'm putting finishing touches on my new novel, "A Couple of Old Birds," publication date to be determined. I'm also on the board of Hugo House, a literary center in Seattle, and I'm chair of the Author Leadership Circle for Binc (The Book Industry Charitable Foundation), which makes grants to booksellers in need. So I have a lot going on!

Sen. Patty Murray: 'Mental health issues don't cause mass shootings'

Texto completo: Sen. Patty Murray asserted on her Twitter account that the true cause of mass shootings are not people who have mental health issues but rather firearms.
Murray tweeted this week in the aftermath of the mass shootings that occurred in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, within 24 hours of each other.
"Mental health issues don't cause mass shootings, guns do," the Washington state Democrat said, calling for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote on House-passed gun control bills.
Tweet
Murray called for more "commonsense gun reform" the day prior.
Tweet
Lead by Democrats, the House of Representatives passed HR 8, which would require universal background checks on gun purchases. McConnell has not moved the bill to the floor.
In the case of the shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, the New York Times reported his mental health problems were "completely untreated in the years before the shooting." His mother had resisted recommendations from doctors that he take medication for some of his problems.
The attacker went on to kill his mother before going to the school, fatally shooting 26 students and staff before killing himself.

Enjoy National Book Lovers Day at the beach, library

Texto completo: "I cannot live without books." ~ Thomas Jefferson
The Founding Father, revolutionary, Renaissance man, third U.S. president, architect and book lover was onto something.
Thomas Jefferson owned thousands of books, most of which he donated to the Library of Congress, and others still sit on shelves at his Monticello home in Virginia. So it's likely that the man himself would have enjoyed today as a special day too: National Book Lovers Day.
A few Neapolitans who have penned national best-sellers call Southwest Florida home (some full-time, some seasonal). They include Janet Evanovich, Scott Turow, and Robin Cook, among others.
Nathan Hill of Naples wrote "The Nix," a novel that published in 2016 and won awards including the New York Times and Washington Post notable books for 2016.
And Robert Ludlum, who penned "The Bourne Identity" and other works that became blockbuster films, lived in a high-rise condo until his death in 2001.
Take time out this weekend to enjoy a book at the beach, at a library or book store or even in your home (stormy weather preferable when reading Stephen King).
And at least for a few hours (and who knows, maybe the entire day), set down your smart phone and any technological distraction and pick up a book.
Here are book events in Naples and Fort Myers this month and next:
Today and Saturday — The Friends of the South County Regional Library will hold a book sale at the branch, 21100 Three Oaks Parkway, Estero. The sale is 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and 1-4:30 p.m. Saturday. See leelibrary.net for more.

The book takes place in Florida, and Whitehead received the Pulitzer Prize for fiction a few years ago for his triumph "The Underground Railroad," about two slaves who try to escape a Georgia plantation. Visit bn.com/bookclub for more.
Aug. 14 — The Naples Writers' Workshop meets every other week at 7 p.m. and provides feedback for short story fiction writers in Naples. The informal group also has a podcast called "Why Is This Good?" For more information, email napleswritersworkshop@gmail.com.

Texto completo: When compliance officers at JPMorgan Chase conducted a sweep of their wealthy clients a decade ago, they recommended that the bank cut its ties to the financier Jeffrey E. Epstein because his accounts posed unacceptable legal and reputational risks.
Yet Mr. Epstein, who had been charged with sex crimes and pleaded guilty in 2008 to solicitation of prostitution, remained a JPMorgan client until 2013.
The main reason, according to six former senior executives and other bank employees familiar with the matter, was that Mary C. Erdoes, one of JPMorgan's highest-ranking executives, intervened to keep him as a client.
Part of her rationale was that Mr. Epstein played a lucrative role recruiting new customers to JPMorgan's private-banking division, which caters to ultrawealthy people and families, the six employees said. That made him an especially coveted client.
The episode is another example of how powerful institutions and individuals, eager to profit from Mr. Epstein and his network of wealthy acquaintances, looked past his criminal history and sex offender status. As a result, he managed to retain crucial business connections even as, prosecutors said in a federal indictment last month, he engaged in the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14.
Mr. Epstein, a JPMorgan client for about 15 years, is being held without bail in a Manhattan jail. He has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, disputed The New York Times's reporting. "Mary would never overrule our compliance team or other controls functions to retain a customer," he said. "She has only one recollection of formally meeting with the customer, which was the day she fired him as a client."
Ms. Erdoes, viewed within JPMorgan as a potential successor to Jamie Dimon, the longtime chief executive, was not alone in making the case for Mr. Epstein inside the bank.
James E. Staley, who ran the bank's asset-management division, which included the private bank, from 2001 to 2009, built JPMorgan's relationship with Mr. Epstein.
During that period, Mr. Epstein introduced Mr. Staley to dozens of wealthy people who became valuable customers of the private bank, a person with knowledge of the relationship told The Times.
In 2002, Leslie H. Wexner, the billionaire founder of the L Brands retail empire, which includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, opened an account at JPMorgan's private-banking offices in Midtown Manhattan. Bankers there received a stack of stock certificates worth roughly $ 1 billion that Mr. Wexner wanted to deposit, according to two private-bank employees who were there.
At the time, Mr. Epstein was the personal financial adviser to Mr. Wexner, who had empowered him to make numerous financial and investment decisions on his behalf. A person close to Mr. Wexner said the retail magnate's relationship with JPMorgan had predated his relationship with Mr. Epstein.
Mr. Epstein connected Mr. Staley to Glenn Dubin, who was then running the hedge fund Highbridge Capital Management. In 2004, Mr. Staley arranged for JPMorgan to buy a majority stake in the fund. The deal transformed JPMorgan's asset-management division into a crucial profit engine for the entire company, and propelled Mr. Staley to new career heights.
Mr. Staley is now the chief executive of the British bank Barclays. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Staley's behalf.
At JPMorgan, Mr. Epstein's accounts attracted scrutiny when the bank's compliance team, beginning at the end of 2008, initiated a wide-ranging review of its customers.
That December, a hedge fund run by Bernard L. Madoff was revealed to be a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan had served as Mr. Madoff's primary bank for more than two decades, a role that prosecutors later said had enabled him to "launder billions of dollars."
Officials at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ordered JPMorgan to review its client roster to make sure that customers were not violating laws or depositing tainted funds at the bank, according to four of the former bank employees.
Compliance officers inside JPMorgan's private bank were instructed to comb through the files of all clients to confirm that their paperwork was in order and that nothing about the nature of their lives or work could entangle the bank in illegal activity or otherwise damage its reputation.
The review lasted multiple years, and Mr. Epstein's accounts were flagged as potentially problematic, the former employees said. A team of company lawyers and compliance officers concluded that JPMorgan should eject him as a client. The exact nature of their concerns is unclear, but by then Mr. Epstein had been imprisoned in Florida and required to register as a sex offender.
Mr. Epstein, however, had loyal allies at JPMorgan. While he was incarcerated in 2008 and 2009, Mr. Staley visited him at the Palm Beach, Fla., office, where a judge had permitted Mr. Epstein to spend time during his sentence.
In 2009, Mr. Staley was promoted to lead JPMorgan's investment bank. His successor as head of the asset-management business was Ms. Erdoes, regarded by her colleagues as an expert at wooing wealthy customers.
Presented with the compliance officers' recommendation that Mr. Epstein be kicked out of the bank, Ms. Erdoes protested that he was a valuable client, according to the six former employees, some of whom were senior executives with direct knowledge of the events. Losing Mr. Epstein would mean potentially losing connections to other lucrative clients, she warned.
Four of the former employees said that they were under the impression Ms. Erdoes was acting in the interests of Mr. Staley, who maintained a strong relationship with Mr. Epstein.
The dispute over whether to jettison Mr. Epstein grew so heated that it became widely known in the bank's executive suites, three of the former employees said.
Ms. Erdoes ultimately prevailed. A compliance officer left the bank after losing the battle, the three employees said.
In January 2013, regulators were unhappy with JPMorgan's progress in weeding out potentially bad actors, and the comptroller of the currency's office publicly ordered the bank to improve its processes for detecting money laundering and rigorously scrutinizing customers.
Later that year, Mr. Staley left JPMorgan and joined a hedge fund. Around that time, JPMorgan cut its ties to Mr. Epstein.
After being expelled by JPMorgan, Mr. Epstein moved his business to Deutsche Bank, where he opened dozens of accounts. Compliance officers at the German bank raised concerns about Mr. Epstein and transactions that they regarded as suspicious, and they tried to get the bank to end its relationship with him. Executives overruled their concerns.
Deutsche Bank stopped doing business with Mr. Epstein in June 2019.
Ms. Erdoes, who joined JPMorgan in 1996, remains in charge of the asset-management division, which has more than $ 2 trillion in assets. She also has a seat on JPMorgan's powerful operating committee.

Texto completo: Even as the central bank lowered borrowing costs in July, it tried to temper expectations that a string of additional moves were imminent. But in the financial markets, it is clear that investors expect rates to fall fast.
In bond markets this week, yields on government debt have touched lows not seen since 2016, when a sharp slowdown in economic growth -- and what many now view as a minirecession -- gripped the economy. The decline implies investors have substantially downgraded their expectations for the economy.
And on Thursday, Trump took fresh aim at the U.S. currency, taking a step closer to scrapping longstanding White House support for a strong dollar.
"With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening, the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition," the president said Thursday. The Fed cut rates last week and ended the gradual shrinking of its balance sheet, which Trump calls quantitative tightening.
The dollar slipped following the president's comments, and analysts said investors were concerned that the risk of a Trump currency intervention was growing.
Why it matters
Yields move lower when bond prices rise, and the latest leg downward began as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing suddenly escalated and investors began to buy government bonds as they sought the relative safety of those investments. The notion that a protracted conflict could weigh on global growth was further fueled Wednesday when central bankers in Thailand, India and New Zealand -- all of which have important trading relationships with China -- lowered interest rates more than analysts had expected.
"You see economic fragility across the globe, and central bankers are looking to get ahead of that," said Dan Ivascyn, group chief investment officer at the bond-focused money manager PIMCO in Newport Beach, California.
The economy has fared better in the United States, where unemployment remains near the lowest levels in a half-century.
What's next
Officials at the Fed have stopped short of suggesting that they are at the beginning of an aggressive rate-cutting campaign. Speaking after the July 31 cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference that the central bank was viewing the quarter-point cut as a "midcycle adjustment to policy" rather than the start of a prolonged easing cycle.

U.S.READIES NEW CHINA TARIFFS
The Trump administration is rushing to finalize a list of$300 billion in Chinese imports it plans to hit with tariffs in a few weeks'time as U.S.companies make a last-ditch appeal to be spared the latest round of duties.
The announcement last week on adding a 10%tariff as of Sept.1 to virtually every Chinese import that's not yet subject to punitive duties took U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer by surprise, people familiar with the discussions said. Lighthizer and his staff are now revising an initial list targeting more than 3,800 Chinese product lines based on issues raised during a public comment period and hearings.
The USTR is planning to publish the final list this week or early next, the people said.

Morning Exercise May Offer Most Weight Loss Benefits

Texto completo: People who exercise in the morning seem to lose more weight than people completing the same workouts later in the day, according to a new study of workouts and waistlines. The findings help shed light on the vexing issue of why some people shed considerable weight with exercise and others almost none, and the study adds to the growing body of science suggesting that the timing of various activities, including exercise, could affect how those activities affect us.
The relationship between exercise and body weight is somewhat befuddling. Multiple past studies show that a majority of people who take up exercise to lose less weight drop fewer pounds than would be expected, given how many calories they are burning during their workouts. Some gain weight.
But a few respond quite well, shedding pound after pound with the same exercise regimen that prompts others to add inches.
This variability interests and puzzles Erik Willis, a data analyst with the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For almost a decade, he and colleagues at the University of Kansas, the University of Colorado Denver and other institutions have overseen the Midwest Exercise Trial 2, an extensive examination of how regular, supervised exercise influences body weight.
In that study, about 100 overweight, previously inactive young men and women worked out five times a week at a physiology lab, jogging or otherwise sweating until they had burned up to 600 calories per session.
After 10 months of this regimen, almost everyone had dropped pounds. But the extent of their losses fluctuated wildly, even though everyone was doing the same, supervised workouts.
When, for a 2015 study, the researchers tried to tease out what had distinguished the biggest losers from those who had lost less, they turned up surprisingly few differences.
Flummoxed, Willis and one of his collaborators, Seth Creasy, a professor of exercise physiology at the University of Colorado Denver’s Anschutz campus, started brainstorming other possible, perhaps unexpected contributors to the enormous variability to weight loss.
They hit upon activity timing.
The science of chronobiology, which studies the ways in which when we do something alters how our bodies respond, is of great interest now. Many recent studies have looked at how meal timing, for instance, affects weight control, including whether exercising before or after breakfast matters. But far less has been known about whether the timing of exercise, by itself, influences whether people lose weight with workouts.
So, for the new study, which was published in July in The International Journal of Obesity, Willis and his colleagues sifted through their data again, this time looking at when people in the Midwest trial had shown up at the university lab.
In that study, participants could visit the gym whenever they wished between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., signing in each time, so researchers had plenty of precise information about their schedules. The scientists also had tracked everyone’s calorie intakes and daily movement habits throughout the 10 months, using activity trackers and liquid energy tracers. They knew, too, whether and by how much people’s weights had changed.
Now, they checked weight change against exercise schedules and quickly noticed a consistent pattern.
Those people who usually worked out before noon had lost more weight, on average, than the men and women who typically exercised after 3 p.m.
The researchers uncovered a few other, possibly relevant differences between the morning and late-day exercisers. The early-exercise group tended to be slightly more active throughout the day, taking more steps in total than those who worked out later. They also ate a bit less, although the difference amounted to barely 100 calories per day on average. Overall, such differences were barely discernible.
Yet, they may cumulatively have contributed to the striking differences in how many pounds people lost, Willis says.
Of course, this study was not large or designed from the start to delve into the chronobiology of exercise and weight. The researchers had not randomly assigned people to work out at particular times, so the links between exercise timing and weight loss they saw now in their reanalysis could be odd accidents related to individual participants’ preferences and schedules with little relevance for the rest of us.
Still, the statistical associations were strong, Willis says. “Based on this data, I would say that the timing of exercise might - just might - play a role” in whether and to what extent people drop pounds with exercise, he says.
But he also points out that most of those who worked out later in the day did lose weight, even if not as much as the larkish exercisers, and almost certainly became healthier.
“I would not want anyone to think that it’s not worth exercising if you can’t do it first thing in the morning,” he says. “Any exercise, at any time of day, is going to be better than none.”

In era of division, we can make too much of a headline

Texto completo: It is hard for me to read some of the reaction to a derided New York Times headline without a smirk, a sigh and a forlorn shake of the head.
The controversy begins with the paper’s original headline Tuesday over a Page 1 story describing President Donald Trump’s statement on the weekend mass murders in Dayton and El Paso. "TRUMP URGES UNITY VS. RACISM," the headline declares. It was changed for later editions to "ASSAILING HATE BUT NOT GUNS."
Critics on the left, led by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweeting a veiled criticism from statistics guru Nate Silver, declared the original headline as evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the right. Critics on the right, led by the usual crowd on Fox News and the president himself, declared the change to be evidence of the Times’ — and by extension, all mainstream media’s — caving to the left.
Advocates of both sides declared it evidence that the newspaper could not be trusted. A Twitter campaign was mounted, presumably uniting the opposing forces against a common enemy, to encourage people to cancel their subscriptions to the Times. This all struck me as ridiculous and shortsighted.
Neither side made reference to the story the headline described, which, it is probably relevant to note, had way more than 280 characters and which, while no objective reader could find it particularly balanced, conveyed a thorough description of the issues it addressed with substantial and substantive commentary from many points of view.
Why, I wonder, are we so eager, so quick, so hungry to bend any opportunity into a sweeping political generality?
It’s not that headlines aren’t important or that editors don’t approach them with care. They are and we do. Even before the Daily Herald’s designers had begun framing out Tuesday’s front page, editor John Lampinen emphasized that we must take care not to ignore the president’s emphatic and clear condemnation of racism in whatever headline we came up with. (Ours, by the way, was "Trump condemns racism, focuses on mental illness.") But headlines are just one component in the telling of a story. They are a summary, produced — as a Times deputy managing editor wrote in describing the evolution of the headline in question — under the twin pressures of time and space, and they are not especially conducive to expressing nuance.
The truth is that both New York Times headlines are correct. It’s equally true that the second more completely describes the story. It’s also true that neither summarizes the whole story. What’s troubling is that both were so easily transformed into irrelevant talking points for the right and left.
And what’s most true — what’s really behind my smirk and my sighs — is that it is such utter nonsense to decry The New York Times as untrustworthy because of a headline. Those who want to define the paper as liberal can find plenty of evidence. Those who want to claim that the Times cost Hillary Clinton the election by focusing on her emails will not be deterred by disputation. But it is utterly ludicrous to suggest that you will not be well-informed and thoroughly engaged if you actually read The New York Times. Or The Washington Post, for that matter, or The Wall Street Journal or many other newspapers, large, medium and small, that qualify as whatever mainstream means.
Will you come across phrases, descriptions, opinions, news judgments and, yes, headlines that bother you? Yes, you will. Unless you rely on a single news source that shares your views and your thinking entirely, you will sometimes be angered and disappointed by things you see or read. But, you will not be better informed by abandoning some reliable news source. To the contrary, if you want to be better informed, you will add to your sphere of information.
So smirk sometimes. Roll your eyes occasionally. But be bigger than the rare annoyances and shortcomings you encounter. You’ll be better for it and more knowledgeable regarding the events and issues you care about.

Statesman’s owner to acquire Gannett in $1.4B deal

Texto completo: GateHouse Media, the company that owns the American-Statesman, on Monday said it is acquiring Gannett Co., a $1.4 billion deal that will create the nation's largest newspaper chain.
GateHouse -- the operating subsidiary of New Media Investment Group -- will combine with Gannett, the larger of the two companies, in a cash-and-stock deal that will be financed in part with new private-equity debt.
The combined new company would take the Gannett name and keep its headquarters in Gannett's current home of McLean, Virginia.
New Media Investment Group CEO Michael Reed will remain CEO, and Paul Bascobert was appointed CEO of Gannett and a member of the Gannett board.
The deal is worth $12.06 a share in cash and stock, or about $1.4 billion. Several industry experts said they do not expect the Justice Department to have an issue with the deal, as the two companies have papers in different markets. The companies expect it to close this year.
The combined company would operate more than 260 daily newspapers in the United States, along with more than 300 weeklies. It would be the largest U.S. newspaper company by far, with a print circulation of 8.7 million, or about 7 million more than the new No. 2, McClatchy, according to media expert Ken Doctor.
The companies estimated they can save $275 million to $300 million in annual costs within 24 months. New Media shareholders will own 50.5% of the combined company, while Gannett shareholders will own 49.5%.
“We believe this transaction will create value for our shareholders, greater opportunities for our employees, and a stronger future for journalism," Reed said in a written statement.
GateHouse bought the American-Statesman from Cox Enterprises in April 2018 for $47.5 million. Other GateHouse newspapers include the Columbus Dispatch, Palm Beach Post, Sarasota Herald-Tribune and Providence Journal, while Gannett's flagship properties include USA Today, Arizona Republic, Cincinnati Enquirer, Louisville Courier-Journal, Nashville Tennessean and Detroit Free Press.
In Texas, the combined company will double its reach, adding Gannett-owned papers such as the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, El Paso Times and San Angelo Standard-Times to GateHouse's stable that includes the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Amarillo Globe News and Sherman Herald Democrat.
Newspaper consolidation has picked up as local papers find it hard to grow digital businesses and replace declines in print ads and circulation. Although newspapers with national readerships like the New York Times and the Washington Post have had success adding digital subscribers, local papers with local readerships are having a difficult time. Hundreds of such papers have closed, and newsrooms have slashed jobs.
According to a study by the University of North Carolina, the United States has lost almost 1,800 local newspapers since 2004. Newsroom employment fell by a quarter from 2008 to 2018, according to Pew Research, and layoffs have continued this year.
Both GateHouse and Gannett are known as buyers of other papers. Bulking up lets companies cut costs — including layoffs in newsrooms — and centralize operations.
Those cuts could give the owners "a cushion of time" to figure out how to improve their digital businesses, longtime industry analyst Rick Edmonds of the Poynter Institute wrote Sunday.
A bigger, combined newspaper company could sell more national ads and boost ad revenue, Butler University journalism professor Nancy Whitmore said. But it's no panacea.
"I don't think, just by these companies merging, they're going to somehow magically find a new business model, make everything all right and produce robust journalism at a local level," Whitmore said.
Consolidation is nothing new to either company. Gannett's last big U.S. print purchase was in 2016, when it bought papers in the Journal Media Group chain for $280 million, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Gannett also owns dailies in major cities such as the Detroit Free Press and Arizona Republic, as well as publishing national newspaper USA Today.
GateHouse, a little-known name to U.S. readers, is owned by the publicly traded New Media Investment Group, itself managed by investment firm Fortress Investment Group, which is in turn owned by Japanese tech giant SoftBank. Gannett and GateHouse said Monday that Fortress will end its management arrangement at the end of 2021.

Texto completo: The Trump administration has ordered the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development to freeze much of the remaining money for foreign aid this year, in a move that suggests the funding could be cut altogether.
The decision, issued in a letter by the Office of Management and Budget, covers a broad range of foreign aid that Congress had already approved. It halted, as of Saturday, the agencies' ability to distribute what the decision's critics estimated to be $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion of funding.
The State Department and the aid agency, commonly known as U.S.A.I.D., must give "an accounting" of all "unobligated resources" of foreign aid, meaning funding that has not been officially designated yet for specific purposes, the letter said.
The letter identified 10 areas of aid to which the freeze would apply, including development assistance, global health, contributions to international organizations, international narcotics control and peacekeeping activities.
The money under review covers the fiscal years 2018 and 2019, which ends on Sept. 30. Agencies often wait until the end of a fiscal year to designate funds.
"This administration's contempt for Congress is astounding," Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday. "When Congress decides how much we spend on foreign assistance, it isn't a suggestion. It's the law, backed up by the Constitution."
Critics of the order noted that the funding was less than one-tenth of one percent of the federal budget.
"In a reckless and irresponsible move, O.M.B. appears set on taking a sledgehammer to one of the most minuscule parts of the entire federal budget that would significantly damage America's security and economic interests -- and thwart congressional authority," said Liz Schrayer, the chief executive of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, a nonprofit group that is an advocate for American diplomacy and counts large companies and nongovernmental organizations as members.
The order came at the start of a long congressional recess, but lawmakers are asking the State Department about the decision. A senior Democratic aide said on Tuesday that Congress had allocated the funds to protect national security interests. The move would set a precedent for future administrations to ignore spending bills and eliminate spending obligations, the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because members of Congress were still determining how to respond.
A spokeswoman for the budget office, Rachel Semmel, said that federal agencies had a responsibility to properly use the money provided by Congress. "In an effort to ensure accountability, O.M.B. has requested the current status of several foreign assistance accounts to identify the amount of funding that is unobligated," she said.
A State Department representative acknowledged the review and said only, "No decision has been made on what will be done with those funds." Additional questions were referred to the Office of Management and Budget.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the office's letter on Tuesday. The Washington Post first reported on the letter on Monday.
The Trump administration has proposed drastic cuts to foreign aid in all its budget proposals, but Congress has rejected those moves each time. President Trump has criticized foreign aid in general, cutting aid to Palestinian refugees and three Central American countries, among others. He has said the Central American nations must prevent their citizens from trying to migrate to the United States.
After the review, the Office of Management and Budget could return money for projects it considers unnecessary to the Treasury Department, in a process known as rescission. The office would send a rescission package to Congress, which would then have 45 days to decide whether to approve ending the funds.
The office's gambit is based on timing, its critics say. Congress is in recess until Sept. 9, so even if it rejects a rescission package, the State Department and U.S.A.I.D. will have only until the end of that month, when the fiscal year ends, to designate the funds.
The money remains frozen at least until the budget office finishes its review. If the office recommends sending the funds back to the Treasury, Congress must approve the action within 45 days or the agencies keep the funds. But the aid agency's window to designate the money opens only after Congress acts or the 45 days expires.
Last year, the office made a similar move six weeks before the end of the fiscal year, also as Congress was in recess. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo opposed the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, over the decision, and members of Congress also voiced concern. The White House dropped the action.
But even before that, Mr. Trump and Mr. Mulvaney's office attempted to push a $ 15 billion rescission package through Congress. That package, which was submitted in May 2018 and covered cuts across federal agencies, was rejected by a margin of one vote in the Senate. It was the first time in nearly two decades that a president had submitted a rescission package, which included at least $ 334 million in foreign aid.
In December, the Government Accountability Office ruled that the administration had no legal authority to make strategically timed attempts to halt and cancel funding in an effort to undermine Congress's appropriations power.
The letter this year arrived at the State Department as Mr. Pompeo was in Australia on a diplomatic trip.
Mr. Pompeo is considered the most powerful of the president's cabinet members, though he sometimes loses policy arguments to other senior officials. He tends to stay closely aligned with Mr. Trump. Analysts and administration officials say Mr. Pompeo, a former congressman, may run for a Senate seat representing Kansas in 2020 or for the presidency in 2024.

Texto completo: CLEVELAND - The Cleveland Orchestra is pleased to announce its continued partnership with Cleveland Clothing Co., which began in 2018 to commemorate the Orchestra's Centennial Season. The apparel company is now offering an updated collection that celebrates the Orchestra and its two homes - Severance Hall and Blossom Music Center. Select designs are available for purchase at Severance Hall, Blossom, and The Cleveland Orchestra's online store: https://tcostore.vendecommerce.com/.
"We're thrilled to be partnering with CLE Clothing once again," said Robert Phillips, Director of Customer Experience of The Cleveland Orchestra. "Much like The Cleveland Orchestra, CLE Clothing brings the passion for and heart of this city to the masses in creative and engaging ways. These new apparel items are a true testament to these shared values."
CLE Clothing Co. co-founder, Mike Kubinski, feels the same way. "CLE Clothing Co.'s tagline is 'Spreading Cleveland Pride, one t-shirt at a time,'" he said. "To say that we are proud of the work we have been able to do with and for The Cleveland Orchestra is an understatement. The Orchestra is one of the pillars of Cleveland's cultural history, one that we are beyond excited to help promote and celebrate."
About the Severance Hall Apparel
Three apparel designs can be purchased at Severance Hall. The first features a reproduction of a sculpture from the concert hall's neoclassical facade and the words "Severance Hall: Home of The Cleveland Orchestra" - available in short-sleeve T-shirt (light green or red) and pullover sweatshirt (black). A second design acknowledges The Cleveland Orchestra's longstanding reputation for greatness with the phrase "America's Finest," in reference to a quote from The New York Times - available in short-sleeve T-shirt (black) and pullover sweatshirt (green). The final design literally connects the Orchestra to its hometown by displaying an image of a conductor's baton rising from the letters "CLE." This short-sleeve T-shirt is available in heather gray and light blue, and can also be purchased in a pullover sweatshirt (maroon) and zip-up sweatshirt (black or maroon). You can also purchase the "America's Finest" and "CLE" designs at Blossom Music Center.
About the Blossom Music Center Apparel
Located in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Blossom Music Center is The Cleveland Orchestra's fifty-one-year-old summer home. Blossom's unique architectural elements are incorporated into two of the three shirt designs, and all apparel features vintage Blossom Music Center logos. One design shows Blossom's amphitheater and the words "Blossom Music Center" - available in short-sleeve (navy or light blue) and long-sleeve (navy). A second design also includes Blossom's familiar amphitheater, this time poised between a shaded tree and a distant sunset. In a final model, the apparel company is offering a blue tie-dyed short-sleeve T-shirt featuring Blossom's logo encircled by music notes, combined to create an image that resembles a blooming flower.
These items are available for purchase at Blossom Music Center now through the end of the Orchestra's Blossom Music Festival season on September 1.

Texto completo: The New York Times issued a correction on an article in which they misidentified law protecting freedom of speech.
The Aug. 6 article, "Legal Shield for Websites Rattles Under Onslaught of Hate Speech," appeared in the technology section and detailed the legal hurdles for websites as they attempt to expunge hate speech from their content. The original article asserted that hate speech was protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, not the First Amendment which protects the rights of Americans to speak freely.
The New York Times issued the correction later that day but the headline and scope of the article, written by Technology Correspondent Daisuke Wakabayashi, remained unchanged.
"Correction: Aug. 6, 2019 An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the law that protects hate speech on the internet. The First Amendment, not Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, protects it," a brief statement noted at the end of the article.
Law & Crime, a blog that writes on legal issues, commented on the gaffe saying that the error was a "legal reporting blunder which, frankly, is neither terribly complicated nor difficult."
Twitter users expressed confusion over the short correction, which seemed to change drastically the content of the work. Eriq Gardner, a senior editor for the Hollywood Reporter, simply posted a "confused" emoji with a screen capture of the correction.Tweet"Love how NYT dropped this short 'correction' at the end of the article that nullifies its whole point," another user said.Tweet

Palin's libel suit revived

Texto completo: A federal appeals court Tuesday reinstated conservative politician Sarah Palin's libel case against The New York Times over an editorial falsely linking her to gun violence, ruling that her suit painted a "plausible picture" that the Times published the piece with "deliberate or reckless disregard for its truth."
The ruling by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not involve any factual findings, only assessing the legal sufficiency of Palin's claims; but the court said the Times' insistence that editorial manager James Bennet made an honest mistake protected by the First Amendment did not have to be accepted at face value.
"The jury may ultimately agree ... that Bennet was credible, but it is the jury that must decide," the three-judge panel wrote in its 21-page decision. "We are satisfied that Palin has met her burden to plead facts giving rise to the plausible inference that Bennet published the allegedly defamatory editorial with actual malice."
The lawsuit focuses on a June 2017 editorial on the shooting of a congressman in Virginia, in which the Times discussed the role of political rhetoric in stimulating violence, and said Palin was responsible for "incitement" of the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gaby Giffords by Jared Loughner in Arizona because her political action committee had distributed literature targeting Giffords' district with crosshairs over her.
The editorial was wrong on two counts: Investigations showed Loughner's dislike of Giffords predated the map and had no connection with it, and the map showed crosshairs over Giffords' district but not her face. The Times, which had itself reported the lack of a connection between Palin's map and Loughner, corrected the editorial within 24 hours.
Newspapers writing about public figures are protected from being sued over false and defamatory statements unless they act with malice - knowledge that what they published was false, or reckless disregard for the truth.
Before dismissing the suit in 2017, Manhattan U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, in an unusual procedure, heard testimony from Bennet that he didn't know about reporting that had debunked the link between Loughner and Palin while rewriting the editorial on deadline, or forgot about it. The judge said the testimony and the Times' quick correction rebutted any claim of malice.
The Second Circuit ruling could now open the door to Palin examining internal Times correspondence that might shed further light on Bennet's state of mind, and whether he was reckless in accusing Palin without checking the facts - a process media organizations like to avoid in litigation. "We are disappointed in the decision and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously," a Times spokeswoman said Tuesday.
In the ruling, appeals Judge John Walker said Rakoff's decision to hear testimony from Bennet before ruling on the sufficiency of Palin's complaint was procedurally incorrect, and Bennet's claims were open to question because both the Times and the Atlantic magazine - where he had previously been editor - had both printed articles that said explicitly no connection had been shown between Loughner and Palin's crosshairs map.
The judge also noted that a draft of the Times editorial that Bennet rewrote had a hyperlink to an article that said there was no connection between Palin and Loughner, and that Bennet and his brother, Democratic Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, both became "outspoken advocates" of gun control after the Loughner shooting, Based on Palin's allegations, Walker said, Bennet had reason to be "personally hostile" to Palin, and was "more likely than the average editor-in-chief to know the truth."
"Palin's allegations present a plausible inference that Bennet's claim of memory loss is untrue," the judge

Texto completo: What's on TV
BH90210 9 p.m. on Fox. "Beverly Hills, 90210," the genre-defining '90s prime-time teenage soap opera, ages up and takes a turn for the meta in this quasi-reboot. The new show assembles members of the original cast, including Jennie Garth, Tori Spelling, Jason Priestley and Brian Austin Green. For six episodes, "BH90210" evokes mockumentary (as well as the "Seinfeld" reunion that once happened on "Curb Your Enthusiasm") with a plot that involves the performers playing versions of themselves who are trying to get the show back off the ground. "We felt like we needed something different because everyone's doing reboots," Garth recently told The Los Angeles Times. "This show was groundbreaking when it started, so we were trying to think of what could be the new version of that."
AMERICAN HUSTLE (2013) 7:35 p.m. on FXM. David O. Russell took the Abscam scandal of the late 1970s and early '80s, covered it in hair and soaked it in whiskey with this screwball comedy. The film stars Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a con man with a comb-over; Amy Adams as Sydney Prosser, a con woman and Rosenfeld's mistress; and Bradley Cooper as an F.B.I. agent out to con the con artists. It also features Jeremy Renner as a shady New Jersey mayor and Jennifer Lawrence as Rosenfeld's wife. "'American Hustle' giddily embraces the excesses of its era, from spandex to 'staches," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, "though it's a farce that speaks as well to this tarnished age."
BULLETPROOF 8 p.m. on the CW. This British import gives an English spin to the buddy cop genre, with the actors Noel Clarke and Ashley Walters playing a pair of London law enforcement officers who were also childhood friends. The first episode involves the pair on the tail of a gang who deal in the theft of expensive cars.
What's Streaming
STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (2017) Stream on Netflix; Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. With most of the summer's big blockbusters in the rearview and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" casting a Death Star-size shadow on the horizon (it hits theaters in December), now may be a good time to revisit the most recent movie in the newest "Star Wars" trilogy. "The Last Jedi" sees the new heroes (Daisy Ridley's Rey, John Boyega's Finn and Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron) enmeshed with the old (Mark Hamill's Luke and Carrie Fisher's Leia) in a race to defeat the evil digital overlord Snoke (Andy Serkis) and the Darth Vader devotee Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). At least one element of the movie -- the relationship between Driver's and Ridley's characters -- is bound to be explored more deeply in the next film. In her review for The Times, Dargis praised the director, Rian Johnson, for his ability to leave his own mark on the decades-old series. "He brings lightness to his banter, visual flair (not simply bleeding-edge special effects) to the design, and narrative savvy to Rey and Kylo Ren's relationship," she wrote.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "Assailing Hate, but Not Guns" (front page, Aug. 6):
Shame on The New York Times for your original front-page headline (later changed) for Tuesday's paper: "Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism"! Mr. Trump did nothing of the kind, and The Times's editors and reporters know that only too well.
The president sullenly read a script that had all the right words, without any indication of feeling or belief in the words he was saying. His recitation was that of a schoolyard bully making an apology to one of his victims using words the principal had made him say.
Paul Vandevert
Dearborn, Mich.
To the Editor:
I applaud President Trump's suggestion that we need to start policing the proliferation of hate on social media. I suggest that we start by deactivating the source of so much of the discord and vitriol plaguing our political discourse: his Twitter account.
Michael Scott
San Francisco
To the Editor:
I find it both regrettable and unsettling that so many of President Trump's foes on the left and in the liberal media rushed to assign direct blame for the shootings on Mr. Trump, repeatedly calling him a racist.
Far too many people are using race as a political cudgel to bludgeon their opponents. Especially in today's highly polarized political environment, recklessly ascribing the "racist" label to one's political enemies is not only irresponsible, but also needlessly inflammatory. To blithely accuse someone of racism without actually knowing what's in the person's heart is not only politics at its very worst, it's humanity at its very worst.
In the future, we would all do well to remember that when people play the race card, everyone gets dealt a losing hand.
Michael J. DiStefano
Jamestown, R.I.
To the Editor:
I briefly visited El Paso a couple of weeks ago and took it upon myself to query people I encountered -- the shuttle driver, fellow riders, hotel employees -- about how they felt about the wall and Mexican migrants. Granted, this is anecdotal, but my consensus was that the white folks in El Paso were against a wall and had no disdain for Mexican immigrants.
"Mexicans are not lazy" and "the closer you get to the border the less afraid you are" came from an older white man.
It's heartbreaking that an out-of-town domestic terrorist caused such harm to this city and its basically peaceful state. Abstract fear of others stoked by our president is creating dangerous men. We need our leaders to quell fear, not inflame it.
El Paso was called a "center of the migrant crisis" by The Times. The people who live in El Paso did not seem to feel this way, but now they certainly do.
Lisa Schiller
New York
To the Editor:
A voluntary nationwide school boycott demanding that Congress enact strong gun control legislation would, I believe, force government action. Parents across the country have a right to expect that the schools they send their children to will be safe. No legislation, no students!
Matthew M. Lind
Houston
To the Editor:
I happened to fly into London on March 13, 1996, the day of the Dunblane massacre in Scotland, in which 16 children and their teacher were shot to death by a lone gunman -- still the most deadly mass shooting in British history. The following year John Major's conservative government passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act, virtually banning handguns. Tony Blair's government strengthened the act soon thereafter.
More recently, following the murder of 51 people in the Christchurch mosque massacre in New Zealand, the government took less than a month to ban semiautomatic weapons.
Countries in which conscience is allowed to prevail over profit have succeeded in enacting meaningful gun control, but in the United States, the murders of 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- and all the atrocities before and since -- have failed to stiffen the slack spines of a majority of our legislators. I despair of the verdict on this past weekend's killings being any different.

Texto completo: Until Monday, when she quietly slipped the bonds that bound her to this world for 88 years, Toni Morrison was one of America's greatest living writers. Certainly, she was among its most celebrated.
Born Chloe Anthony Wofford on Feb. 18, 1931 in Lorain, Ohio, just outside of Cleveland, the future writer of stories that would sear the American conscience insisted she had been a child of poverty as well as privilege that thrived in black families forced to weather the deprivations and indignities of Depression-era America.
Though she was an influential editor in the world of publishing, Ms. Morrison didn't publish her first novel until 1970 when "The Bluest Eye" delighted critics and readers with its unprecedented exploration of "colorism" within the black community.
"The Bluest Eye" was an auspicious debut for a writer about to turn 40, especially when many contemporaries her age were busy reinventing themselves after reaching the pinnacle of their literary careers or flaming out entirely.
With incantatory and mythic language reminiscent of the magic realism of South American writers, "The Bluest Eye" established the template of an approach to writing that characterized all 11 of her novels: a deep and free roaming exploration of the interior lives of her characters - usually black women forced to navigate a crisis that was as urgent, all-consuming and contradictory as America itself.
A divorced mother of two teenaged sons by the time she debuted on the bestseller lists, Ms. Morrison quickly established her literary reputation with a series of early novels that plumbed the depths of our national denial about race and violence. Each novel encompassed a tale almost too painful to tell until Ms. Morrison applied her insight and literary bravado.
"The Bluest Eye" was followed by "Sula" (1973), "The Song of Solomon" (1977), "Tar Baby" (1981) and her most celebrated novel, "Beloved."
Ms. Morrison won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for "Beloved," a story about a black woman's decision to murder her own child rather than see her subjected to the indignities and cruelties of slavery. The mother in that novel was literally and figuratively haunted by her unthinkable act the same way Ms. Morrison seemed to say America was haunted by the original sin of slavery. The metaphorical always became personal in the novels of Toni Morrison.
Lyrical and tragically resonant, "Beloved" also revealed Ms. Morrison to be America's foremost chronicler of voices rarely heard in the nation's fictive narratives. It turns out that no one was more adept at cracking open the unknown tombs that dotted our psychic landscape than Toni Morrison. With each novel, she revealed America to be a vast, haunted house of racial and domestic terrors.
That's how Ms. Morrison became our foremost literary ghostbuster and teller of hard truths at a time when it was difficult for much of the country to admit its sublimated racial past still existed in the shadows of contemporary prejudices.
Even so, it took almost a dozen Toni Morrison novels for the vast majority of readers to acknowledge the painful truth she had been proclaiming since 1970.
In 1993, Ms. Morrison became the first African American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature and the first woman to win it since Pearl S. Buck in 1938.
The Nobel was an international validation of the importance of Ms. Morrison's work and a vindication of her decision to become a voice of singular honesty about the pain, joy and endless complexity of the black experience.
While some African American critics bemoaned what they called Ms. Morrison's fascination with slave narratives and stories rooted almost exclusively in the Jim Crow era, Ms. Morrison was able to reach large and appreciative audiences. Her complex stories might have been bypassed by those readers if not for Oprah Winfrey championing four of her novels, despite each book's challenging language and premise.
Ms. Winfrey, who starred in director Jonathan Demme's 1998 movie version of "Beloved" as the mother who kills her child to prevent her enslavement, helped America get comfortable with the author thanks to her immensely popular Oprah's Book Club.
Ms. Morrison had also been a superb curator of black fiction and nonfiction in anthologies and in her capacity as an editor at Random House, where she toiled for decades before her writing career really took off. It was there that she shepherded autobiographies by Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis into print.
She introduced the work of African writers Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka to American readers as early as 1974's "The Black Book."
In 1949, Toni Morrison enrolled at Howard University, where she received a bachelor's degree in English in 1953. She graduated with a master's in English from Cornell University in 1955.
Ms. Morrison returned to Howard and taught writing to a generation of eager young writers. It was at Howard that she met and married Jamaican American architect Harold Morrison. The marriage didn't last, but it provided Ms. Morrison with enough pain to fuel her future novels.
She held onto her ex-husband's last name and published her first novel under "Toni," the shortened form of her middle name, though her friends and family continued calling her Chloe. For years, she claimed it was a mistake to publish under Toni, but she never made serious moves to rectify it. It became yet another example of an American writer creating a name and persona that fit their creative output better than their "real" name.
Ms. Morrison also taught for long stints at Yale University and Princeton University where she is remembered as an engaging teacher and mentor.
But if there's anything, besides literature, that Ms. Morrison is known for, it is pronouncing Bill Clinton "our first black President" in a New Yorker essay during the height of the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. It was a rare misstep by an otherwise astute social critic whose larger point was lost in a sea of denunciation from all quarters.
In 2012, Ms. Morrison got a "do-over" of sorts when she received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama, America's first actual black president.
It was awarded on the basis of Ms. Morrison's long and influential literary career, which Mr. Obama said inspired him and millions of other Americans who looked to her for hard truths no one else in American letters was capable of conveying with as much elegance and lived experience.
Toni Morrison had lived the American Dream on her own terms without sacrificing an iota of personal integrity along the way. Her reputation as an American literary giant was hard-fought and well-earned. The American literary canon can be easily divided into a literary landscape before and after Toni Morrison.

What do local women say about their sex lives? Former Post editor found out

Texto completo: Anne Rodgers is a former Palm Beach Post editor and writer known for her Charm columns focusing on women over 45.
She spent three years researching and writing Kiss and Tell: Secrets of Sexual Desire from Women 15 to 97, a project she undertook with Dr. Maureen Whelihan, a board-certified gynecologist now practicing in Greenacres.
The book is based on 1,300 surveys with Palm Beach County women, who gave honest and often startling answers about what does – and doesn’t – appeal to them in the bedroom. The survey questions were open-ended, so like the study mentioned in the New York Times story, the comments provided real insight to women’s sex lives.
For instance, in response to the question, “What is the one thing you wish your partner would not do in regards to sex?”, a few answers from post-menopausal women are illuminating:
“Take a Viagra and not tell me.” 71, married
“Lose his erection.” 67, married
“Turn the lights on.” 62, divorced
“The same thing over and over again.” 64, married
Other questions included, “What stimulates your desire?” and, “What is your quickest route to orgasm?” After patients in Dr. Whelihan’s practice filled out the six-question survey, Anne conducted nearly 100 face-to-face interviews spanning the decades for the book’s narrative.
Some of the survey’s findings in were consistent across all ages. For instance, kissing is most often mentioned as what stimulates women’s desire, no matter their age. Passionate kissing never gets old for women; it is the most often-mentioned way to get in the mood for what comes next. Time and again the women’s comments note that if the smooching is lackluster, their interest lags.
In long-term relationships, when partners are available to one another 24/7, sustaining desire can become an issue for older couples. The concentration levels of testosterone in men are roughly eight times higher than those in the majority of women, and though testosterone decreases as men age, their levels still give them the advantage. A male partner may feel ready for sex fairly often, while a woman finds herself in a “neutral” position sexually.
This is why when a man asks if a woman is in the mood for sex, it’s easy for her to say no; she just isn’t feeling it. Dr. Whelihan encourages her patients to instead answer, “I don’t know, convince me.” That way, the door remains open, with men called upon to do a little seduction, reminding their partner of how stimulating foreplay and sex can be.
“A smart man,” she says, “knows how to coax a woman out of neutral and propel her forward.”
These tips aside, generalizations about sex in menopausal women are hazardous. Each situation has individual challenges. One 64-year-old subject spoke of battling a litany of health challenges that made enjoying sex next to impossible, but described a “decade of delight” in her 30s when she and her husband were deliriously happy sexually.
Another 61-year-old responder wrote, “As my husband has gotten older and it’s more of a challenge {for him} to keep an erection, playing lollipop [oral sex} is a way to help him keep his erection. Oral sex is more about foreplay than for orgasms for both of us.”
Then again, many women surveyed spoke of renewed sex lives after menopause, finding lovers after divorce or widowhood who sparked their libidos and brought them “the best sex of their lives.”
Each woman’s path is truly her own.

La estricta Nueva York no escapa a los tiroteos masivos: 521 baleados este año, cifra en alza

Texto completo: Aunque los funcionarios de Nueva York condenaron pronto las nuevas masacres de civiles baleados en ataques al azar en otros estados del país el fin de semana, la ciudad tiene su propio problema de violencia armada.
Es cierto que el crimen de Nueva York está en niveles mínimos, pero ello no implica que no haya necesidad de controlar las armas.
Hace apenas unos días, el 27 de julio, un tiroteo masivo en una fiesta comunitaria en Brownsville (Brooklyn) dejó a una persona muerta y 11 heridos. Y la madrugada de ayer, en una vigilia en Crown Heights, cuatro personas más resultaron heridas de bala.
En el ínterin, el gobernador Andrew Cuomo firmó una ley que desde septiembre subirá de 3 a 30 días el período para tramitar un permiso de armas en Nueva York.
Específicamente en NYC, hay un auge de las pandillas violentas y varios inocentes han sido alcanzados por balas perdidas desde principios de junio en toda la ciudad, seis de ellos menores de edad.
Hasta el 28 de julio, 521 personas habían recibido disparos este año en la ciudad de Nueva York, en 441 incidentes, según la policía. Ello indica un alza frente a 501 personas disparadas en 413 incidentes en el mismo período en 2018.
Los disparos no se extienden de manera uniforme por toda la ciudad. Algunos recintos en Queens y Manhattan no han reportado ningún tiroteo este año. Otros han sumado muchos.
En el distrito 79 del Norte de Brooklyn, que incluye a Bedford-Stuyvesant, 24 personas han recibido disparos este año, incluidas las de la fiesta el 27 de julio donde los investigadores dijeron que varias víctimas tenían vínculos con pandillas.
Inmediatamente después de ese ataque en Brownsville, Eric Adams, presidente del condado de Brooklyn y otros más, pidieron que el hecho se etiquetara como un tiroteo masivo.
El alcalde Bill de Blasio inicialmente se resistió a llamarlo así, pero luego sí usó el término, destacó The New York Times.
“Nos hemos vuelto insensibles a la violencia armada en ciertas partes de la ciudad”, comentó Adams ayer. “Once personas en Park Avenue en Manhattan, es un tiroteo masivo y una crisis. Once personas baleadas en Park Place en Brooklyn, es un día (normal) en el vecindario”.
¿Cómo se compara el estado de Nueva York con otros en términos de leyes de armas?
Nueva York tiene una calificación A del “Giffords Law Center” para prevenir la violencia armada. El centro clasifica a Nueva York en el 6to de los 50 estados por la fuerza de sus leyes sobre armas, y el 48 de los 50 por tener una de las tasas más bajas de muertes por armas.
El Centro destaca que existe una correlación directa entre leyes más estrictas sobre armas y menos muertes. Pero los grupos pro derechos de armas creen que estas leyes penalizan a propietarios que son respetuosos de la ley.
¿Cuáles son las leyes de armas de Nueva York?
Después del tiroteo masivo en la escuela primaria Sandy Hook en Connecticut en 2012, el estado de Nueva York impulsó leyes más estrictas sobre armas (The Safe Act).
Esas reglas requieren que las armas de asalto se registren cada cinco años con la policía estatal, y hacen que las verificaciones sean obligatorias. en un esfuerzo por evitar que las personas con antecedentes penales graves o enfermedades mentales compren armas.
¿Cuántos delitos se cometen con armas de fuego en el estado de Nueva York?
El año pasado, hubo 7,885 crímenes violentos cometidos con armas de fuego en Nueva York, según cifras estatales. Más de 4,200 de esos crímenes ocurrieron en los cinco distritos de la ciudad de Nueva York, con pistolas como principal arma.
Muchas de las armas usadas en esos crímenes no son de acá. Según la Fiscalía general del estado, llegan a Nueva York desde lugares que no tienen leyes tan estrictas como las locales.
While gun control advocates view no single measure as a cure-all, they see tightening background checks as one of the most basic steps to diminish gun violence. Most Americans support such efforts, polls show, but the NRA portrays them as an affront to the Second Amendment.

Texto completo: A Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur and winemaker has agreed to pay $3.76 million in penalties after his company bulldozed a protected wetland and filled in a stream bed to build a vineyard in Mendocino County, North Coast water regulators announced Friday.
The settlement — one of the largest ever involving water quality on the North Coast — stems from a litany of environmental violations tied to unpermitted work by Rhys Vineyards starting as far back as 2015 on owner Kevin Harvey’s 4,500-acre ranch west of Highway 101 near Laytonville.
The company covered half an acre of protected wetlands with 2,178 cubic yards of fill in the North Fork Ten Mile River watershed, state officials said. It also filled a half-mile of ephemeral stream with 537 cubic yards of dirt and other material.
“The illegal and permanent loss of wetlands and streams caused by the vineyard construction was an egregious violation of state and federal law,” Josh Curtis, North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board assistant executive officer, said in a written statement.
Rhys’ Santa Rosa-based lawyer Tina Wallis said in a Thursday news release the company “deeply regrets the mistakes made.” Harvey, a Bay Area venture capitalist, could not be reached for an interview. An associate of Wallis’ said he was out of the country.
Authorities said Rhys Vineyards officials made no attempt to obtain permits or contact relevant agencies before building a vineyard on top of a stream and wetland. Further, the company constructed a farm reservoir and operated two others using unauthorized diversions of water, according to the settlement.
The work was so extensive, including grading and installation of tile drains, that officials said it would be nearly impossible to restore the area to its natural state. Instead, the new vineyard will remain in place and the company will pay a fine amounting to about half of the penalties — $1.89 million — to fund two stream restoration projects in Mendocino County.
Officials say the settlement amount reflects the damage done and represents the full weight of the state’s approved formula for meting out fines.
“For the North Coast, this is a very large penalty,” said Ken Petruzzelli, an attorney with the State Water Board’s Office of Enforcement. “It’s one of, if not the largest penalty they’ve ever issued.”
Curtis said in a prepared statement the settlement demonstrates the Santa Rosa-based board’s commitment to protecting and restoring the region’s waters, as well as maintaining a level playing field for other vineyard operations.
In addition to the North Coast and state water boards, the settlement involved the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
Rhys Vineyards was founded about 15 years ago by Harvey, who has been listed on Forbes’ Midas List of top tech investors and dealmakers. Rhys Vineyards has been praised in publications ranging from the San Francisco Chronicle to the New York Times for its pinot noir, which the Times called among the best in the nation.
In news stories and on its website, Rhys Vineyards has been described as taking great care in site selection for vineyards.
Not so in this case, state officials said.
The unpermitted vineyard “involved the improper construction of roads and stream crossings, causing irreparable harm to already fragile wetlands,” according to the North Coast water board’s release.
As part of the settlement, the company will stop operating one of the involved reservoirs and work to obtain proper permits for the other two. The settlement further requires the vineyard to fix the entire road network on the property to eliminate future impacts to streams.
The sediment discharge into streams, officials said, posed potential harm to imperiled runs of Chinook and coho salmon and steelhead trout within the Ten Mile River watershed, which empties into the Pacific south of Newport on the Mendocino Coast.
Half of the settlement amount will go toward operations of the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.
The other half will support the pair of Mendocino County habitat projects, one overseen by the Nature Conservancy in the nearby South Fork Ten Mile River, and the other managed by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in Dutch Charlie Creek, a tributary of the South Fork Eel River.
Wallis, Rhys Vineyards’ attorney, said the company is committed to implementing all required actions.
The company also is exploring options to set aside a majority of the property for conservation, she said.

8chan, a site favored by suspected mass shooters, is losing its network home

Texto completo: 8chan, a hate-filled forum site where multiple suspected mass murderers have posted manifestos to cheers from their anonymous fellow users, will no longer receive service from a crucial provider of web infrastructure.
Cloudflare said late Sunday it will cease acting as 8chan’s content distribution network and cybersecurity provider, two days after a gunman killed 20 people and wounded 26 others in El Paso minutes after apparently publishing an essay railing against immigration from Latin America. The move will probably make it difficult for 8chan to repel crippling distributed denial of service attacks until it’s able to find a new provider.
But Cloudfare Chief Executive Matthew Prince said the move by his San Francisco firm is unlikely to keep 8chan offline for long, as the forum site may find another service provider.
“Unfortunately the action we take today won’t fix hate online,” he wrote in a blog post. “It will almost certainly not even remove 8chan from the Internet. But it is the right thing to do.”
In a tweet, 8chan suggested the effects of Cloudflare’s decision would be temporary, writing, “There might be some downtime in the next 24-48 hours while we find a solution.”
Prince has largely resisted the idea that his company should be responsible for policing the content of the websites it helps operate, although it did withdraw service from the Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, in 2017, in the face of heavy pressure from activists and the media. (That site since found another service provider and remains online.)
But 8chan has made itself uniquely radioactive. In the latest manifesto, which Prince said appears to be authentic, the El Paso suspect saluted the perpetrator of the March 2019 massacre of 49 Muslims at a New Zealand mosque. The suspect in that attack allegedly posted a manifesto on 8chan explaining his motives. A man accused of killing one person and wounded three others in an attack at a Poway, Calif., synagogue in April also posted on 8chan beforehand.
Although Cloudflare took no immediate action in response to those attacks, in a blog post Sunday night, Prince said the pattern of extremists using 8chan to inspire each other had made it indefensible. “The rationale is simple: they have proven themselves to be lawless and that lawlessness has caused multiple tragic deaths,” Prince wrote. “Even if 8chan may not have violated the letter of the law in refusing to moderate their hate-filled community, they have created an environment that revels in violating its spirit.
“We reluctantly tolerate content that we find reprehensible, but we draw the line at platforms that have demonstrated they directly inspire tragic events and are lawless by design,” he added. “8chan has crossed that line.”
“Lawless by design” is apt. 8chan’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, created the site after growing disillusioned with the top-down control architecture of 4chan, another popular message-board site where extreme politics, inflammatory speech and trolling are the currency. Brennan’s innovation was to set up 8chan as a site where users could create their own message boards. His anything-goes ethos made it a natural home base for the instigators of the then-nascent phenomenon known as Gamergate, an explosion of hate and harassment aimed at critics calling for more diversity in video games.
But Brennan sold 8chan in 2015 to an entrepreneur based in the Philippines and has long since moved on in his own politics. Shortly after the El Paso shootings, he told the New York Times that he thought 8chan should be shut down entirely. Tucows, the domain name service provider through which 8chan registered its web address, 8ch.net, told the Times it was deliberating on how to respond.

What candidates can do to help fix our democracy

Texto completo: For the Monitor
Last month, presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke unveiled a suite of policies to “realize the full potential of our democracy” focused on securing and expanding access to our elections. A few weeks later, Sen. Michael Bennet rolled out a proposal to “strengthen our democracy” by reforming the way we fund campaigns, draw districts and lobby Congress. Then, Sen. Elizabeth Warren posted her plan to “Protect our Democracy” by expanding voting rights and securing elections. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has a democracy plan focused on ethics and transparency. Mayor Pete Buttigieg says democracy is the first issue he would tackle as president and has a plan for voter suppression. Joe Biden called for an international summit of democracies. On July 4, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand introduced her plan to “protect our democracy” and tackle corruption.
There is now a healthy and much-needed competition of ideas underway to fix our democracy.
This should come as no surprise. A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that 53% of Americans believe that the country is not “able to overcome political divisions to solve problems.” Furthermore, 49% of all adults and 56% of Democrats believe that our democracy needs a “total overhaul” or “major changes.”
The solutions these candidates have offered – from stopping voter suppression, to increasing government and campaign transparency, to securing our elections – are critical. Landmark legislation passed this year by the House of Representatives, HR 1, would address these issues. But there's an additional set of reforms that must also be a part of plans for strengthening our democracy, and that's restoring and strengthening the checks and balances that keep our democracy from sliding toward authoritarianism. We need to hear more on how the candidates will do that.
Every day, the current president shows us how an aspiring autocrat can rattle the constraints we place on power, sometimes breaking them while almost always weakening them. Around the world, democracies are being overtaken by authoritarian populists at an alarming rate, highlighting the need to take this threat seriously. The American people care about this too – a 2018 survey from the George W. Bush Institute, the Penn Biden Center and Freedom House found that over half of all Americans believe the United States is “in real danger of becoming a nondemocratic, authoritarian country.” Indeed, we formed an organization, Protect Democracy, specifically dedicated to ensuring that does not happen.
So as part of their reform proposals, candidates need to share plans for protecting our democracy from declining into a more authoritarian form of government. And a big part of that solution will be to restrict the office of the president from abusing its power – for the next president and for their successors. Because, sadly, if global trends are any indication, Trump will not be the last candidate for the office who aspires to unchecked power.
Candidates can demonstrate their commitment to checks and balances in two ways: first, by supporting new laws to guard against presidential abuses of power, and second, by making public pledges about how they will conduct themselves once in office.
As to the first commitment, the candidates should embrace a comprehensive set of legislative reforms to harden guardrails that prevent against presidential abuse of power. Several of these measures have already been introduced in this Congress, including bills that would prohibit improper interference with the fair administration of justice, deter abuse of the pardon power, and provide a bulwark against legal claims by presidents seeking to place themselves above the law. It's now time for 2020 candidates to go on record pledging to enact these bills as the next president.
The second way candidates can demonstrate their commitment to our checks and balances is to lay out what limits on their own executive power they'll adhere to. Because the temptation will be great for a future president to see Trump's extensions of executive power not as cautionary tales but as precedents justifying their own use of similar tools. But that kind of race to the bottom is where democracies go to die. Our organization has put out 11 red lines candidates should publicly commit to observe. And they should answer candidate questionnaires, like the one from the New York Times telling voters their views on the limits of executive power.
It's true that Sen. Mitch McConnell has already broadcast that if he controls the majority, he'll stonewall Democrats' legislative proposals – as he did to President Barack Obama. So there's an understandable instinct among the candidates to lay out what they can achieve through the use of executive power – and to be hesitant about handcuffing that power. But there's a difference between lawfully exercising the power that Congress has delegated to the executive or setting general enforcement priorities, on the one hand, and using extreme claims of executive power to ignore or rewrite the laws, on the other.
At the end of the day, the solution to our political dysfunction is political reform of the sort many of the candidates have proposed, not an ever increasing one-way ratchet in which presidents become kings. Because tempting as it may be to seek king-like powers for a president whose agenda one might support and we expect to govern in good faith, history tells another story: that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

WHAT'S BEHIND NADLER'S IMPEACHMENT POSTURING? TO PUT IT BLUNTLY, NADLER IS IN A TOUGH SPOT

Texto completo: First elected to Congress in 1992, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York is a well-established member of the Democratic establishment and a loyal follower and supporter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. So, what's behind Mr. Nadler's pointed determination to pursue President Donald Trump's impeachment? Mr. Nadler appears to be ignoring the speaker's wishes. Perhaps there is more here than meets the eye.
It has been underreported that Mr. Nadler faces a credible challenger in New York's Democratic primary in 2020. Specifically, Mr. Nadler's opponent is the capable-appearing Lindsey Boylan. Ms. Boylan - who is 35 years old, a recent deputy secretary for economic development for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and a daughter of a Marine - has several things going for her. She has raised more than $250,000, which might not sound like a lot but is already more than triple what Mr. Nadler's Republican challenger raised in 2018. With nine months to go until the primary, this energetic young progressive may just be getting started.
Ms. Boylan has staked out a committed position to impeach Mr. Trump, and she accuses Mr. Nadler of being soft and ineffective as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. "We need a leader, not a follower," she told Politico this month, adding that Mr. Nadler is "trying to place the blame on someone else, Nancy Pelosi. I don't think that is a way to lead."
To state the obvious, Nadler looks a lot more like Joseph Crowley, the longtime incumbent whom Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., defeated in a 2018 primary, than he does a recruit for "the Squad." Conversely, Ms. Boylan seems a more experienced version of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.
To put it bluntly, Mr. Nadler is in a tough spot. You have to assume Ms. Pelosi has given him a pass to appear to be outside her control. The Judiciary Committee chair can look like he is proceeding with impeachment without going too far. This means Mr. Nadler must maintain some sort of political Brownian motion, always appearing to be on the move but never really going anywhere. Members of Congress have enjoyed reelection rates of 90% or higher since 2012, and primary challengers face a steeper hill to climb. But there are local factors that suggest Ms. Boylan might have a better chance than your average long-shot candidate.
The boroughs of New York have a history of Democrat insurgency that long predates Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. In 1970, Bella Abzug beat a 14-year incumbent in a primary in a district made up of parts of Manhattan. Two years later, Elizabeth Holtzman beat a 50-year incumbent (one of the House's longest-serving members) in a Brooklyn district to become at the time the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
There is not only precedent at play here but also a pattern. Longtime incumbents House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., also face primary challenges this cycle - in Mr. Engel's case, one backed by the same Justice Democrats political action committee that helped propel Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to victory last year.
It's impossible to determine exactly how much of Mr. Nadler's push for impeachment is driven by a longing for the Klieg lights as opposed to the fear of an appealing young primary opponent. But no discussion of the internal workings of a Democratic House would be complete without a reference to legendary House Speaker Tip O'Neill, who is credited with saying that "all politics is local." You can bet that this is something Mr. Nadler has brought up more than once in private discussions with Ms. Pelosi. In a year when Democrats are supposed to be on offense, a number of them are feeling threatened within their own party.

Hi, we're Pui-Wing Tam and Jim Kerstetter, tech editors filling in for Jamie Condliffe while he's on vacation. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
Facebook has connected the world, which brings many benefits for communication and the dissemination of information. But there's a downside that hasn't gotten much attention until recently: the love scams that proliferate on the social network.
In these scams, some Facebook users -- often young men in Nigeria -- steal the digital photos and identities of Americans in the Marines, Army, Navy and Air Force. Posing as the service members, the scammers sweet talk vulnerable and lonely women, forming an emotional connection -- and eventually asking for their money.
Our colleague Jack Nicas followed one military love hoax. He found Renee Holland, who had an online friendship with a person she thought was an American soldier named Michael Chris. She sent Mr. Chris $ 26,000 to $ 30,000, much of the life savings that she and her husband had socked away.
But Mr. Chris was not a real person. The photo that Ms. Holland saw was of Sgt. Daniel Anonsen of the Marine Corps -- and he was contending with dozens of impostor Facebook and Instagram accounts, and had no idea who Ms. Holland was.
In December, Ms. Holland's husband, Mark Holland, killed her and her father before turning the gun on himself. Mr. Holland did not leave any indication of a motive.
The New York Times published her story last weekend and aired it in an episode of our television show, "The Weekly."
"In some of her final conversations with me, Ms. Holland expressed how thrilled she was that we were covering her story," Jack said of the tragedy. "She said she wanted to raise awareness about the issue and prevent future scams."
The story caught the attention of Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois. Mr. Kinzinger, a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, is one of the many American service members who have been ensnared in these scams.
For years, Mr. Kinzinger said, impostors have been posing as him or using his image to trick people out of money. As much as he has complained, the problem has persisted.
On Wednesday, he sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, requesting more information on what the company is doing to prevent such fraud on its sites.
"There needs to be accountability for this issue that can, quite frankly, destroy lives," he wrote to Mr. Zuckerberg. "Facebook has an immensely significant role to play in getting this situation under control."
Mr. Kinzinger said he was also in the early stages of preparing legislation to address the issue.
The inevitability of the banking hack
For financial institutions, it has become a way of life: fending off endless hacking attempts. Hundreds of thousands a day in some cases. But sometimes they get through, and the apologies begin.
On Monday, the federal law enforcement authorities said a Seattle woman who used to be an engineer at Amazon had hacked into Capital One's computer systems and obtained the personal data of tens of millions of customers.
It appears that the bank made a fairly simple mistake that allowed the hacker to break in: a "misconfiguration" in a firewall. A firewall, one of the oldest digital security tools, acts like a gate on a network, keeping most traffic out and a few things in. It is usually up to network administrators to decide what should be allowed in, and the authorities said the hacker had been able to take advantage of a mistake the administrators had made.
No doubt, it was embarrassing for the bank. But successful hacking attempts are shockingly common. Already this year, there have been 3,494 successful cyberattacks against financial institutions, according to reports filed with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, our colleagues Stacy Cowley and Nicole Perlroth reported.
Another big number to keep in mind: Mastercard, for example, combats some 460,000 intrusion attempts in a typical day, up 70 percent from a year ago.
Successful banking hacks? Be surprised it doesn't happen more often.
Some stories you shouldn't miss
■ It appears that iPhone sales are still slowing. On Tuesday, Apple said that its net income had fallen 13 percent and that its revenue had risen 1 percent in the latest quarter, with iPhone sales continuing to decline. But there were gains in the company's services and wearables business.
■ Imagine a bicycle built for none. A team of researchers in China is rethinking autonomous transportation with a souped-up bicycle that can navigate on its own. The demonstration is really a way to show how a new computer chip tailored for artificial intelligence can work.
■ EBay accused three Amazon managers of illegally conspiring to poach its sellers in a federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday. EBay first raised concerns that Amazon was approaching its sellers last fall in another lawsuit that has since moved to arbitration.
■ Children as young as 11 have been added to a facial recognition database maintained by the New York Police Department. Elected officials and civil rights groups say the police have been doing this with little public scrutiny, and they worry about the frequency of false positives in young faces.
■ Uber is laying off about 400 people, or a third of its marketing department, as it tries to whittle down costs. Many observers were stunned that the ride-hailing company actually had 1,200 people on its marketing team.

Texto completo: For the Valley News
Even as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the lunar landing, truly one of the greatest achievements of the 20th — or any — century, a sizable minority of Americans persist in their belief that the walk on the moon never happened. It was, they say, a put-up job, a conspiracy. Some even embroider the theory to posit that the film director Stanley Kubrick, or someone else, produced the hoax on a sound stage in some back lot in Hollywood.
I confess that I never gave conspiracy theories or theorists much attention, consigning them to the dustbin of flat-Earthers or the anti-fluoride brigade. But I began to rethink that during a recent flight from Atlanta to Burlington. The conversation started out pleasantly enough. My seatmate and I somehow discovered we had Swiss heritage in common. He had recently moved to Utah (“No, I’m not a Mormon”), and he was involved in some computer-type business. He was, in short, an affable, manifestly intelligent and educated person.
The conversation took a turn when he asked what I thought of President Donald Trump. I sensed trouble and, not wanting to wade into a political dispute, tried to sidestep the question. He persisted, and I finally mumbled, “Well, not much,” hoping for a quick end to the conversation and an opportunity to bury myself once again in my New Yorker.
No such luck. My interlocutor was unfailingly pleasant, but he proceeded to inform me that Barack Obama was Muslim and that Michelle Obama, his wife, was actually a man. I was dumbfounded. I might have expected such silliness from a boozy lout with untied shoes and a Phillies jersey, munching on a bag of Cheetos, but this man seemed utterly respectable.
Conspiracy theories have been around for a long time. Thomas Jefferson was accused of being an agent for France when he ran for president in 1800. Ardent Protestants through the centuries have suspected the pope of being the Antichrist. Who can forget the Bilderbergers, the Bavarian Illuminati, the Trilateral Commission or the visit of space aliens in Roswell, N.M.? And did you know that the Denver International Airport was built above an underground city, which is the headquarters for the New World Order?
Perhaps it’s my imagination, but it seems to me that conspiracies began to pick up in the 1960s. The John Birch Society had been warning about black helicopters, agents of the United Nations, for a while, but the assassination of John F. Kennedy brought conspiracists into the mainstream — well, almost the mainstream. Lyndon Johnson was well aware of that possibility, which is why he tapped Earl Warren, chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to head a commission to determine who was responsible for Kennedy’s death. The commission’s finding that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone did little to placate the fevered conspiracists.
The 1960s prompted a crisis of authority in America. Johnson had lied to us about Vietnam; Richard Nixon lied about, well, pretty much everything. Confidence in institutions — political, educational, media, business, religious — began to wither. Americans didn’t know who to trust, and this lack of trust created a petri dish for conspiracies.
The age of the internet has allowed conspiracy theories to proliferate — and proliferate they have: 9/11, Pizzagate, the conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax, which was perpetrated, Trump insists, by the Chinese. The anti-vaxxers, mired in their fears about the safety of vaccines, have precipitated a public health crisis. A provocateur named Alex Jones has apparently fashioned an entire career out of conspiracy theories, including the doozy that the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 20 children and six staff members dead, was staged.
And let’s not forget the conspirator-in-chief. Donald Trump likely would not be president today were it not for the so-called “birther” conspiracy, the nonsense that Obama was born in Kenya, not in the United States, and therefore was constitutionally unqualified to be president. Trump peddled “birtherism” relentlessly for years, finally prompting Obama to produce his birth certificate, the first president in history to do so.
Trump has continued to propagate conspiracy theories, most of them casting himself and his administration as victims. He thinks that the investigations of his campaign’s contacts with Russian operatives, including the Mueller probe, are a conspiracy against him, even though copious evidence of wrongdoing has been produced. His incessant banter about “fake news” suggests he believes that the media is conspiring against him.
Why do so many Americans imbibe conspiracy theories? The aforementioned crisis of authority is certainly part of it, I think, but there also may be a less pernicious reason for their popularity: Some — I repeat, some — conspiracy theories can be fun, a kind of parlor game, allowing people to spin out elaborate scenarios and speculate about the actions and the motives of various individuals.
Most conspiracy theories, I hasten to add, are not that benign, especially when they threaten the nation’s democratic order. One of the more recent is something called QAnon, which insists that the so-called “deep state” is engaged in an elaborate, secret plot against Trump. (The perpetrators of QAnon participated in the invitation-only “social media summit” at the White House last month.)
Harrison Schmitt, the last man to walk on the moon, has his own theory about why Americans have become so susceptible to conspiracy theories: a failure of education. “If people decide they’re going to deny the facts of history and the facts of science and technology,” he told The New York Times, “there’s not much you can do with them.” Schmitt, who served as a Republican senator from New Mexico, added, “For most of them, I just feel sorry that we failed in their education.”
In the spirit of conspiracy, I’ll close with my own conspiracy theory, one that I’ve repeated since Election Day 2016 to anyone who will listen. Actually, it’s not so much conspiracy as an awful premonition. I fear that even if Trump is defeated in the presidential election of 2020, he will refuse to leave office. He will cry fraud and “fake news” and hunker down, insisting that he really did win re-election, all credible evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. I have little doubt that Sean Hannity and the sycophants at Fox News would join the chorus demanding that Trump remain in office.
That, in turn, would create a constitutional crisis, especially with a lapdog Senate and a judiciary of Trump’s own making. Such a scenario might eventually involve the military, which constitutionally is under the control of the commander-in-chief.
I shudder at the prospect. And if that speculation makes me a conspiracist, I suppose I must take my place alongside the anti-fluoride cabal.

The Russians are coming — for real

Texto completo: In his recent testimony on Capitol Hill, former special counsel Robert S. Mueller issued a warning that echoed the 1966 movie comedy, "The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!" Except he wasn’t joking. Far from it.
"Over the course of my career," said the longtime FBI director, "I have seen a number of challenges to our democracy. The Russian government’s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious." Asked if those efforts were continuing, Mueller snapped, "They’re doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next campaign."
So how did President Donald Trump and his acolytes respond? By denying and denouncing the unvarnished truth Mueller had stated. By plunging their heads deeply into the sands of self-delusion.
Within days of Mueller’s appearance, Trump had engineered the departure of Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence, who had earned a reputation for courageous candor by refuting the president’s prejudices and emphasizing Moscow’s malign machinations.
A year ago, after the president eagerly embraced what he called Vladimir Putin’s "extremely strong and powerful" denials that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, Coats fired back: "We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy."
Another Trump appointee, FBI Director Christopher Wray, made a similar point at a Senate hearing the day before Mueller testified: "The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections."
Every Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee signed a bipartisan report documenting the "growing volume of malicious activity" targeted at U.S. election systems. And while the senior Republican, Richard Burr of North Carolina, said some progress has been made in protecting those systems, "There is still much work that remains to be done."
The president has turned a deaf ear to all these extremely loud alarm bells. His choice to replace Coats, Rep. John Ratcliffe, is an obscure Texan who seems to have only one qualification for the job: a slavish devotion to Trump and a ravenous appetite for discredited conspiracy theories embraced by the president and his cheerleaders in the right-wing media.
At the same time, practical bipartisan legislation aimed at bolstering the ability of election officials to ward off Soviet subversion was blocked by the Senate’s Republican leader and Trump’s Chief Enabler, Mitch McConnell.
"A whole-of-government approach is impossible to achieve when the head of government is hostile to any meaningful action," editorialized The Washington Post. "President Donald Trump appears to interpret any defense against or even mention of Russian interference as an attack on the validity of his election."
Trump’s relentless refusal to acknowledge Russia’s role in his victory symbolizes a much larger flaw in his approach to the presidency: rejecting any information that contradicts his view of the world.
Take just one example: After Coats testified last January that Iran was living up to their nuclear agreements, an enraged president tweeted that his own intelligence team should "go back to school." Then he added: "They are wrong!"
There it is. Pure Trump. I am right and they are wrong. He derides and dismisses climate scientists who document global warming, economists who prove that tax cuts won’t pay for themselves and demographers who demonstrate that immigrants are essential for the nation’s economic health. And that approach makes rational decision-making and problem-solving impossible.
How can the nation respond to the tocsins tolled by Mueller, Coats, Burr and Wray (Republicans all) if there are no accepted facts, no common basis for deliberation, no respect for the professional researchers and analysts whose life works are to study, measure and describe reality?
The answer is clear. America cannot respond and the public knows it. In the latest ABC/Ipsos poll, only 17% said they were "very confident" that "the U.S. can effectively defend itself" from foreign intrusions into next year’s campaign.
It’s entirely appropriate for lawmakers to disagree on policies and priorities. But the whole process of decision-making is severely crippled when those lawmakers cannot even agree on the nature of the problem they are trying to solve.
As Douglas Wise, a former CIA officer and deputy head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told The New York Times: "Intelligence has to be candid, truthful and accurate even if it is unpleasant and does not confirm to the biases of the president."
The Russians are indeed coming. And Trump is not building a wall to keep them out. He’s opening a door to invite them in.

Epstein became lost in his own perversely tragic fantasy

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted, and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff’s" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: After completing 12 books for "The Land of Stories" fantasy series, Chris Colfer is back with a brand new adventure – and this one, he reveals, was the "toughest book" he's ever had to write.
The author, known for his role as Kurt Hummel in the Fox musical show "Glee," has captured a huge fan following from his best-selling middle-grade series. "A Tale of Magic" will be a sequel to that series.
"A Tale of Magic" (Little, Brown and Co.), out Oct. 1, is special for a variety of reasons.
The tale follows 14-year-old Brystal Evergreen, as she tries to survive the oppressive Southern Kingdom where it is illegal for women to read books. While working as a maid at her local library and having to sneak out titles, she discovers a secret section with a book about magic, which is also outlawed throughout the world, leading her down a complicated path.
The book, which tackles powerful issues, was more difficult to write than Colfer imagined.
"At its core, 'Tale of Magic' is a story about overcoming prejudice and oppression and more than anything I hope it inspires and encourages anyone out there who is fighting their own battles of injustice or inequality," he told USA TODAY.
"When I first started, I was not expecting it to be as difficult as it was, but the world changed so significantly since I agreed to do it, to when I started writing it... I knew I had to tell a story that I thought would help kids and families out there who are having a difficult time with the times we live in," he continued.
Colfer is embarking on a tour for the book, he shared exclusively with USA TODAY. But unlike Colfer's previous book tours for "Stories," which transformed into auditorium-sized events with costume contests, readings and games, the format for his new tale will be much more traditional, beginning with the tour's first stop in New York City on the day of the book's release.
"Since this is a brand-new series I'm going to be doing a traditional book signing this time around," Colfer revealed .
"As soon as the readers are familiar with the new story, the new characters, we'll go back to the town hall-style because it was a big hit with the kids – and their parents because they didn't have to wait in a line with their kids," he laughed.
What the New York Times bestselling author is most looking forward to, however, is the fan reaction to the meaningful story line behind the book.
"One of the biggest motivations for this book was actually for parents and teachers, and for all the parents and teachers out there who are having a difficult time talking to their children about the troubling things they see on the news every day," he said.
Colfer explained that writing has always been a therapeutic activity for him, and helped him get through some of his own toughest times.
"As a kid, I had a sister with special needs, which was very difficult for my family, so whenever times got tough I would just whip out my computer or a pad of paper. ...
That tool came in later when I grew up as a closeted gay kid in a public high school, and also being a gay teenager on public television," he said.
As a vocal member of the LGBTQ community, the author shared he has received appreciation from LGBTQ fans who connected with his books.
The author added that although "A Tale of Magic" acts as a prequel, it is a "completely independent story, and you don't need to read 'Land of Stories' to enjoy it."
Fans might want to get reading soon because Colfer announced his next literary focus: writing the sequel.

Covington Catholic students file libel suit

Texto completo: CINCINNATI – A dozen public figures have been named in a libel lawsuit that claims their comments on the Covington Catholic incident were defamatory.
The suit was filed Friday on behalf of eight unnamed Covington Catholic High students present during the now-viral encounter with Native Americans on the National Mall, in which Nathan Phillips sang and played a drum as Nick Sandmann and his classmates stood around him. Some students chanted and performed a tomahawk chop, considered by some as mocking toward Native Americans.
This new lawsuit seeks a fraction of the more than three-quarters of $1 billion sought by Nick in his three suits against media companies. This suit was also not filed in federal court.
This suit, submitted by attorneys from Los Angeles and Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, seeks at least $15,000 and at most $50,000 for each student from each of the 12 defendants. That makes for a total of at least $1.44 million and at most $4.8 million.
The suit lists the following as defendants, claiming they made defamatory comments against the "Covington Boys," as they are identified in the suit:
Rep. Debra Haaland, a congresswoman from New Mexico;
Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and frequent guest on CNN;
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a congresswoman from Massachusetts and presidential candidate;
Maggie Haberman, a New York Times reporter;
Kathy Griffin, an actress;
Matthew Dowd, a political consultant and analyst;
Reza Aslan, a scholar and author;
Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton;
Shaun King, an activist;
Adam Edelen, a former state auditor of Kentucky;
Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones;
and Jodi Jacobson, the editor in chief of Rewire News.
Haaland, who in 2018 joined Sharice Davids of Kansas as the first Native American women elected to Congress, tweeted about Phillips "being harassed and mocked by a group of MAGA hat-wearing teens."
The tweet is defamatory, the suit alleges.
But David Marburger, a Cleveland-based First Amendment attorney, was critical of the suit's credibility after reviewing it.
"Assuming politics don't intervene in the judicial system, this is exceedingly weak," he said. "I can't see anything that is colorably actionable as defamation."
Aslan is listed in the suit for tweeting a photo of Nick and Phillips and the question, "Have you ever seen a more punchable face than this kid's?"
Warren tweeted that Phillips "endured hateful taunts."
Kruse tweeted the students "mocked" Phillips and "taunted women."
The same and similar language highlighted by the suit as defamatory was listed as protected speech by a federal judge in Kentucky just last week, when U.S. District Judge William Bertelsman dismissed Nick's $250 million suit against The Washington Post.
Citing a Supreme Court decision, Bertelsman wrote statements that are "loose, figurative" or "rhetorical hyperbole" are protected by the First Amendment because they can't be proved true or false.
He identified certain words used by The Post as falling under this protection: "swarmed," "taunting," "disrespect," among others.
Another parallel exists between Nick's federal suit and the one filed in state court. In his ruling, Bertelsman wrote some of The Post's identifiers – "the teens" and "hat wearing people" – couldn't constitute defamation of Nick because he wasn't named or specifically described.
This new suit includes a tweet by Navarro that deems "MAGA-hat wearing teens" racist. And a tweet by King about "young kids in MAGA hats" is also included.
Marburger said the defendants may find protection because some of their comments were directed at a group rather than individuals. Though the suit says the statements were "interpreted by their [the students'] friends, family and associates as about them personally."
The suit claims the defendants called for the "public punishment" of the students, who received hate mail and death threats.
Griffin, in a tweet, called on her followers to identify, shame and "dox" the students. To dox is to publish personal information and encourage the harassment of others.
Edelen, the former Kentucky auditor, is the only Kentuckian named in the suit.
Robert Barnes, an attorney on the case, said by email that because no plaintiff is seeking more than $75,000 from any one defendant, the case could not legally be filed in federal court.
Marburger said the plaintiffs are "deliberately limiting the potential damages to keep it out of federal court."
"They figure if they go to federal court, they're going to lose because of the Bertelsman ruling," he added. "I've defended about 100 libel suits. Nobody limits libel suit damages."
Kevin L. Murphy is the local attorney representing the students.
Kenton Circuit Judge Kathy Lape will handle the case.
She was elected in 2014 to an eight-year term.

Going back to work after loss Like Meghan McCain, many women quietly return to jobs after suffering miscarriage

Texto completo: What do most professional women do after they've had a miscarriage early in the pregnancy? Go back to work, seemingly without skipping a beat, often saying nothing about it.
Meghan McCain, a co-host of "The View," recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, revealing that she'd had a miscarriage. At the time, she went back on the air after missing only a few days.
But, she explained, when you're a daily fixture on national television, even a few days' absence is enough to cause rumors. "I am not hiding anymore," she wrote. "My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone."
Neither would I. I've had that experience twice.
My first miscarriage took me completely by surprise. My body had always worked like clockwork, and I'd assumed it would efficiently produce a healthy child. But then the technician explained to my husband and me at our first ultrasound that while I had a gestational sac, there was no embryo inside it.
"Lights on, nobody home" is how I couldn't help thinking about it.
It was a traumatic experience, but also oddly isolating. My husband, Bill, of course, was by my side every moment he could be, but he was also struggling with his own reaction and desperate to know that I would be OK. And so I was determined to be OK, whenever he was around. Alone, in my bathtub, was the only time I let myself cry.
I was determined to be OK around everyone else as well. We hadn't told most people that we were pregnant yet; it's a good idea to wait until you're well into the second trimester, and I was only in the beginning of it. Only the people we were close with knew anything had happened at all, and those who did know didn't seem to know what to say. So nobody said much of anything.
I've always been in love with my career, so I returned to that love as the most logical thing to do. A few days after that first miscarriage, I flew to Chicago for a conference. I never considered canceling. I hadn't planned to tell anyone I was pregnant, so it seemed just as easy not to say anything about the miscarriage.
Back home that weekend, Bill's son and daughter-in-law were having a christening for a child of their own. They had started having babies in their 20s. Bill is older than me, and I had married him at 40. That meant we were starting, or attempting to start, our family late in life, when he was already a grandfather.
Being in my 40s added an extra layer of shame to the whole event. It felt like my own fault for having hesitated too long.
It didn't occur to anyone, not even Bill, that I might not want to go celebrate someone else's baby. When I suggested that I stay home, his reaction was enough to convince me that I really couldn't say no. So I put on my prettiest dress and my best smile and went through the whole day acting as though nothing was wrong.
Afterward, I learned that some family members had asked Bill how I was doing. I kind of wish they'd asked me instead. I wouldn't have known what to say, but at least I'd have felt that my miscarriage was a real event, not a ghost occurrence that couldn't even be mentioned.
The second time, after a few more years of trying, the miscarriage came much more quickly. I started spotting less than two weeks after the positive pregnancy test. I'd barely gotten used to the idea that I was having a child when it turned out I wasn't having one after all. By this time I was 45, and I knew I'd lost my last chance to carry a baby to term.
The following week, I headed to New York for yet another conference. For days, I smiled and networked and solved problems and chatted with hundreds of people. Again, I didn't mention that I'd just had a miscarriage.
If I'd managed to have a baby, there would have been a shower and gifts and all the ritual that goes with that. If there had been a death in the family, there would have been another set of rituals to mark that occasion. If I'd had a serious illness, there would have been get-well cards and questions about how I was doing.
For a miscarriage, there is none of that. There is just silence. And an immediate return to what's supposed to be normal life.
McCain equates her miscarriage with losing a baby that she says she'll always love. For myself, I don't quite see it that way. I never felt a kick, or finished picking out a name, or bought a crib, or did any of the things that would make a baby seem truly real. But it was a big loss nonetheless.
Health organizations estimate that there are about one million miscarriages a year in the United States. It's happened to millions and millions of women.
We live in a culture that's good at creating traditions and rituals for nearly every stage of life, from turning 16, to graduation, to a death in the family. Something so common and so devastating deserves to have a ritual of its own. At least, it deserves to be talked about, not met with the bland pretense that nothing at all has happened.
It deserves better than silence.

Texto completo: Nectarines are a peach relative. Peaches and nectarines can have either white or yellow-flesh. Yellow-fleshed nectarines are common now, but prior to WWII most were white-fleshed. At that time white-fleshed nectarines were fragile and rarely shipped. Now there are both white-fleshed peaches and nectarines that go by the name “Summerwhite.” Both were bred to have high sugar contents and ship well. – Courtesy Cheyenne Botanic Gardens, www.botanic.org

An estate planning lawyer’s approach to blended families

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

Texto completo: A film documenting the life and work of renowned American author, Nobel Prize winner and teacher Toni Morrison will be featured as part of the Cane Fire Film Series at the Acadiana Center for the Arts.
The screening of "Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am," set for Aug. 12 at 7:30 p.m., is a fundraiser for Festival of Words Cultural Arts Collective, a nonprofit based out of Grand Coteau.
In her works, Morrison broaches subjects of race, America, history and the human condition.
The film discusses her many critically acclaimed works and "reflects on her lifelong deconstruction of the master narrative" that is woven together with a rich collection of art, history, literature and personality, according to an ACA press release.
The documentary offers an "artful and intimate meditation" on Morrison's life, from her childhood in Ohio to book tours with Muhammad Ali. The film features Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis and Morrison herself.
"Throughout, Morrison is effortlessly graceful, insightful and candid, making this intimate, comprehensive portrait of her life and works an exploration of what it means to be a writer whose stories are so deeply intertwined with often-unrealized national truths," The Sundance Institute wrote on the documentary.
Michael Scott Myers, founder of the Cane Fire Film Series, said he chose the film because it's not something Lafayette would normally get in regular theaters. The Cane Fire Film Series started in 2012 and has shown American independent, foreign, animation and documentary films every second Monday of the month.
"Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am" premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, receiving high praise on Rotton Tomatoes with a 97% approval rating, a lower score on IMDb at only six and a half stars and some feedback from New York Times chief film critic A.O. Scott.
Advanced tickets can be purchased at ACA, 101 W. Vermilion St., or online for $10. Tickets can also be purchased the night of at the front desk.

REVIEW --- The Ecstatic Chaos of Woodstock --- Fifty years later, the music festival remains a symbol of the 1960s' hope and squalor.

Texto completo: There was no Google Maps to help you find the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival on Aug. 15-18, 1969. In place of social media there was only word-of-mouth. But that was enough to draw more than 400,000 people to a rented 600-acre parcel of Max Yasgur's dairy farm, 100 miles north of Manhattan in the White Lake area of Bethel, N.Y.
As Woodstock approaches its 50th anniversary, nostalgia runs as thick as the ankle-deep mud in Yasgur's pasture. Today, schoolchildren tour The Museum at Bethel Woods to view the handwritten lyrics of "Goin' Up the Country" by Alan Wilson of Canned Heat and the bass guitar of Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane under glass. Any square can order a tie-dyed Woodstock T-shirt from Amazon and have it delivered faster than a Volkswagen bus could have navigated the snail-slow New York Thruway on the festival weekend.
But the real Woodstock, in all its grimy, rain-soaked glory, was an authentic historical climax. Anchored by 33 musical acts, it was the defining 1960s counterculture party: a four-day cyclone of peace, love, rock 'n' roll, shaggy hair, hippie fashion, torrential downpours, Vietnam War angst and underground revolt. And lots of mind-altering drugs. From the stage, MC Edward "Chip" Monck famously warned that "the brown acid that is circulating around us is not specifically too good." But he also said, "Of course it's your own trip, so be my guest" -- and legions hungering for higher consciousness did.
Richie Havens opened the festival at 5 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 15. Though he'd been slated to play for only 20 minutes, the organizers asked him to keep going because the next act, Sweetwater, was running late. Extemporizing, Havens improvised an ecstatic "Freedom" chant that became, thanks to documentary film footage, a signature Woodstock moment. "It was about spirituality," Havens said, "about love, about sharing, about helping each other, living in peace and harmony."
That wasn't a universal reaction among performers. The Who's Pete Townshend was appalled by the drug-induced mayhem unfolding around him. "What was going on off the stage was just beyond comprehension -- stretchers and dead bodies and people throwing up and people having bad trips," he remembered in "Woodstock: Three Days That Rocked the World," the authoritative history of the festival published in 2009, which includes interviews with many of the participants. "I thought the whole of America had gone mad."
That sentiment was widespread at the time. Woodstock proved irresistible to the news media, which trumpeted its LSD overdoses, public nudity, food shortages, transportation problems, rancid latrines, collapsing stages and electrocutions. The New York Times deemed the event "Nightmare in the Catskills," after a teenage concertgoer was run over and killed by a tractor while asleep in a field. Another man died from a heroin overdose, and around 6,000 people were treated at the festival's makeshift first-aid tents.
Bob Dylan, who was living in the actual town of Woodstock, N.Y., at the time (40 miles northeast of Bethel), had turned down a spot in the festival. "I didn't want to be part of that thing," he said. "I just thought it was a lot of kids out and around wearing flowers in their hair, taking a lot of acid. I mean, what can you think about that?"
For many, of course, that was the whole point. Rebelling against their parents' values and angry at America's prosecution of the war in Vietnam, the era's young people saw Woodstock as a cultural liberation, while their elders viewed it with fear.
CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, whose own daughter had sneaked off to Woodstock, was consumed with worry. "My gosh," he recalled, "the next thing we know, coming on television is this wild bunch in the muck and the mud up at Woodstock with the dope running rampant."
Beyond the muck and the mud was the music. There were highs (swamp-rockers Creedence Clearwater Revival) and lows ('50s nostalgia act Sha Na Na). There was the stupendous funk sizzle of Sly and the Family Stone, the raw blues of Janis Joplin and the blistering Latin rock guitar of Carlos Santana. There was a pregnant Joan Baez singing "We Shall Overcome" and British belter Joe Cocker gyrating through the Beatles' "With a Little Help From My Friends." Jefferson Airplane performed "Somebody to Love" and "White Rabbit."
"You feel proud to have been a part of it," guitarist Robbie Robertson of The Band later recalled. "You feel it was amazing, you feel it was a first, you feel it said something."
The music pushed past midnight on Sunday, then past daybreak Monday. At 8:30 a.m., the festival's headliner finally took the stage. A one-time U.S. Army private, 27-year-old Jimi Hendrix had gained world-wide fame since releasing his first album, "Are You Experienced," in 1967. At the time of Woodstock he was the highest-paid performer in the world.
Wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket, with a red scarf tied around his Afro, Hendrix surveyed the garbage-strewn landscape. The crowd had thinned, with only about 30,000 people remaining. But Hendrix, backed by his new band Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, launched into a fierce two-hour set that produced one of the greatest filmed moments of the 1960s: his gonzo rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."
It was a lesson in being an American in 1969. Bending notes and sculpting feedback to mimic bombs bursting in air, at one point dropping in the funereal notes of "Taps," Hendrix transformed the national anthem into a cry for freedom, peace and ecstasy. When the TV host Dick Cavett later questioned Hendrix about the brazen performance, he said calmly, "All I did was play it. I'm an American, so I played it. . . . I thought it was beautiful."
Hendrix's mind-boggling rifts crowned Woodstock -- and with it, in a very real way, the 1960s. In little more than a year, both Hendrix and Janis Joplin would be dead from drugs. The Vietnam War peaked, then ended. Flower Power gave way to the Me Decade.
Fifty years later, however, the utopian promise of Woodstock is still powerful. The lesson of the festival, to many, is that life isn't about the storm but about dancing in the rain. "Woodstock is in our mind," said Country Joe McDonald, who performed on the second day. "Not the present or past. It can happen anywhere, anytime."
But such positive remembrances are hardly the whole of Woodstock's legacy. A warning coda is also necessary for all those concertgoers and their peers encouraged to gobble Orange Sunshine acid like cookies and drop out of society. Too many of the festival's wayward pilgrims were led by the promise of psychedelic liberation down a path of no return. "I thought I was going to die on drugs -- end of story," recounted Woodstock veteran David Crosby in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone. "I don't know why I'm alive and Jimi isn't, and Janis isn't . . . and all my other friends. I have no idea why me, but I got lucky."

Biden's Iraq War support a ripe target for Democratic rivals

Texto completo: In the 2008 Democratic primary season, Hillary Clinton got hit repeatedly for her vote in favor of the 2002 Iraq War resolution. Her chief opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, had been a vocal opponent of military action in Iraq, which proved an important element in his upset win.
A dozen years later, another prominent senator from that era who backed the Iraq War resolution, Joe Biden, is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. With the passage of time, the war has been denounced by much of the general public as a mistake. Yet, it's still an open question whether Biden, who went on to serve eight years as Obama's vice president, will be hurt by that vote nearly 17 years ago.
The issue reared its head Wednesday during the second night of Democratic debates, when a Democratic primary rival, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, boasted of voting against the Iraq resolution as a backbencher of the House minority. That prompted one of the moderators, CNN's Jake Tapper, to ask Biden why he had voted to authorize the Iraq invasion.
"I did make a bad judgment, trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get the inspectors in and get the U.N. To put inspectors in," Biden said Wednesday. "From the moment 'Shock and Awe' started, I was opposed to the effort and outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and administration."
That statement, though, paints a revisionist picture of Biden's approach to Iraq. As ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the late 1990s, and then its chairman from June 2001 to January 2003, Biden proved a hawk in his desire to depose Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Biden described Iraq as one of America's chief foreign adversaries and repeatedly raised questions about whether international inspectors could ever reasonably track Saddam Hussein's chemical and biological weapons programs.

"I think you and I believe and many of us believe here as long as Saddam's at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out, root and branch, the entirety of Saddam's program relative to weapons of mass destruction," Biden told chief United Nations weapon inspector Scott Ritter during a Senate hearing in September 1998.

Like many lawmakers, the 9/11 attacks provided an opening, eventually, for regime change in Iraq. Biden centered his chief concerns regarding Iraq around the leadership of Hussein, who he said was a source of constant destabilization in the region.

"If Saddam Hussein is still there five years from now, we are in big trouble," Biden said in February 2002 at an event with the Delaware National Guard.

By July of that year, Biden, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, began holding congressional hearings over a possible invasion of Iraq. Although the hearings were ostensibly to voice both the pro and anti sides of the potential war, Biden made his leanings explicit their opening day, when he released a New York Times op-ed outlining his concerns about Hussein.

"If we wait for the danger to become clear and present, it may be too late. That is why some believe removing Mr. Hussein from power is the better course," Biden wrote.

Those hearings gave the Bush administration and members of Congress in favor of war in Iraq more political capital to give President George W. Bush's administration room take military action. In September 2002, Biden and the rest of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee drafted a resolution outlining the parameters of a potential conflict with Iraq.

"We are trying to give the president the power that he needs and get a large vote," Biden said at the time.

While the Senate's resolution ultimately failed in the face of a more expansive one from the House, Biden would be one of 77 senators who voted in favor of war. Biden was among 29 Democrats voting in favor, while 21 opposed the measure.
And it marked a turnaround from his vote nearly a dozen years earlier to oppose authorization of military force in the Persian Gulf to counter Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iraq the previous August. In that January 1991 vote, approved 52-47, only Democrats voted in favor. Biden was among 45 opposing the use of force for the Gulf War: a conflict widely seen as a rousing U.S. victory.
Even as the war continued, despite his remarks at the Democratic debate, Biden remained supportive, even after the so-called "Shock and Awe" strategy by the Bush administration.
"I personally think this job is doable, or I wouldn't have voted for us going into Iraq in the first place. I think it is doable. I no more agree — just for the record — with your assessment that "Iraq is the hotbed of terror" now than I did when your assertions about Al Qaeda connections at the front end," Biden told the Senate, months after the initial invasion. "And I voted to go into Iraq and I'd vote to do it again."

Texto completo: He is the second CEO to leave since Art Van since the company was acquired in 2017 by Boston-based private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners.
Art Van Furniture said Thursday that it is parting ways with its president and CEO Ron Boire, who joined the 190-store retailer just over a year ago.
Boire, a past chief executive for Barnes & Noble and Sears Canada, will transition out of his Art Van job in the coming weeks. The furniture and mattress retailer announced that its board of directors is working with an executive search firm to find a replacement for Boire, who started at the Warren-based company in April 2018.
The company did not disclose the reason for Boire's planned departure.
He is the second CEO to leave since Art Van since the company was acquired in 2017 by Boston-based private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners after 58 years of ownership by founder Art Van Elslander.
Van Elslander died in February 2018 at the age of 87. Two months later, Boire replaced the previous CEO Kim Yost.
Boire was at the helm of Barnes & Noble from September 2015 to August 2016. At the time of his departure, the bookseller said its board of directors determined that Boire was "not a good fit for the organization," the New York Times reported.
The retailer also announced Thursday that Gary Van Elslander, a board member and son of the elder Van Elslander, has assumed the role of chairman of the board.
"Today marks another important step in Art Van's transformational journey," Gary Van Elslander said. "I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board of directors, the executive leadership team and our dedicated Art Van associates who proudly embody my father's vision when he founded his iconic company 60 years ago."
Art Van is the top furniture and mattress retailer in the Midwest with 190 stores in nine states, including stores under the brands Scott Shuptrine Interiors, Levin Furniture, Levin Mattress, Wolf Furniture and Gardiner Wolf Furniture.

TRUMP ORGANIZATION DENOUNCES MANHATTAN D.A. PROBE

Texto completo: A lawyer for the Trump Organization late Thursday denounced a new investigation by the Manhattan district attorney of the company's role in so-called hush-money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels as a "political hit job."
Subpoenas issued by the district attorney's office target the way the company accounted for re-paying Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for $130,000 he gave Daniels to keep quiet during the 2016 campaign about an alleged affair with President Donald Trump, according to a New York Times report revealing the new probe.
The investigation by District Attorney Cyrus Vance's office follows the announcement last month by Manhattan federal prosecutors that they have concluded their probe of the hush money payments without charges against the Trump Organization, its executives, or anyone but Cohen, who is serving a three-year prison term.
"This is a political hit job," said Trump Organization lawyer Marc Mukasey. "It's just harassment of the president, his family and his business, using subpoenas as weapons. We will respond as appropriate."
A Vance spokesman declined to comment.
Cohen has said repeatedly that Trump directed him to make the payments to Daniels and to arrange for another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to be paid through the National Enquirer.
In court filings, federal prosecutors have said that the Trump Organization ultimately reimbursed Cohen $420,000, including the $130,000  paid to Daniels, and "falsely accounted for these payments as legal expenses" after Cohen submitted invoices "falsely indicating" that he had a "retainer agreement."
Those claims triggered widespread speculation that key Trump Organization officials with access to sensitive information about the president's business dealings could be in the cross hairs of prosecutors.
When the federal probe was closed without charges last month, Cohen issued a statement from prison that singled out the failure to charge the Trump Organization for criticism, saying it should be of "great concern to the American people and investigated by Congress and The Department of Justice."
Vance, a Democrat, has faced criticism for not pursuing charges against Trump's family over alleged misleading statements to condominium buyers before Trump became president.
The new probe marks his second foray into a Trump-related case since the 2016 election. He is currently pursuing charges against former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort for fraud and falsifying business records in New York. Manafort is already serving a federal prison sentence.

Plan OKs import of drugs to ease costs

Texto completo: Travis Paulson of Eveleth, Minn., has been buying lower-priced prescription drugs from a mail-order pharmacy in Canada for years, but each shipment came with the risk of being seized by U.S. Customs because it's illegal for Americans to import prescription medications.
That could change under a proposal announced Wednesday by the Trump administration.
States would be empowered to launch their own drug importation programs so long as they take steps to make sure the medicines are safe and that consumers would see a "significant reduction" in costs.
Although the proposal is in its early stages, the news was welcomed by some Minnesota advocacy groups that hope it will bring needed relief to patients struggling with high and rising drug prices.
"We have heard from our members for a long time that they are sick of paying the highest prescription drug prices in the world," said Will Phillips, state director of AARP Minnesota. "Our research shows that across all parties and ideologies importation is widely supported."
But others expressed dismay when they learned that some medications would be ineligible for importation, including insulin used to control diabetes. Insulin prices have soared in recent years, causing some diabetics to ration medicine or even seek out black market sources.
"It is disappointing that one proposal would totally exclude insulin," said Nicole Smith-Holt, who has been advocating for affordable insulin since her son died two years ago. He had been rationing insulin because he couldn't afford its high price.
Smith-Holt said the importation proposal should not sideline ongoing talks among Minnesota lawmakers to finish an emergency insulin access bill that could be considered during a special session this year.
"I am pleased that they are continuing to work on it, but the ultimate hurdle is who pays for it," she said.
Insulin could be imported under part of the proposal announced Wednesday, but only if drug manufacturers agreed to allow reimportation of their own drugs from foreign countries. The prospect of that seemed unlikely as the industry's leading trade group, PhRMA, called the proposal "dangerous."
Paulson, who has diabetes, said it appeared unlikely that insulin importation would be made legal under the current proposals. "They haven't proven that they can do the right thing," he said of the drug industry.
Paulson prefers to drive to Canada, where he can get an insulin vial without a prescription for $27. Mail order, which he typically uses only if winter weather makes driving difficult, carries a price of $57, mostly because of shipping charges.
So far, all his shipments have come through unhindered. The Canadian pharmacy requires him to sign release forms acknowledging that he can't get a refund if the package is seized by Customs and that he bears legal responsibility. But compared to the $150 co-payment that a vial would cost him in Minnesota, he has been willing to take the risk.
State importation programs also could not import controlled substances like narcotics, drugs that are injected intravenously or through infusions, and biological drugs, which include insulin and popular but pricey medications for rheumatoid arthritis.
Minnesota's version
Several states, including Florida and Vermont, have recently sought approval to begin importation programs.
Others, including Minnesota, operated successful programs in previous years despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
"We did it anyway," said Kevin Goodno, who was Minnesota Human Services commissioner in 2004 when the program was launched. Then Gov. Tim Pawlenty wanted to provide low-cost drug options to residents, including seniors, who at that time did not yet have a Medicare drug benefit.
State officials vetted several Canadian pharmacies to make sure their suppliers were legitimate and that they could handle the Minnesota business. They then set up a website that created a pipeline to two of the Canadian providers.
"It was more of a recognition that people were doing this anyway and we wanted to protect Minnesotans," Goodno said.
The FDA warned Minnesota that its efforts were illegal but never intervened. After Medicare added drug coverage, the so-called Part D benefit, demand waned and the program was shut down in 2010 after facilitating 25,000 prescriptions at a savings of $1.7 million.
Prescription drug prices have already emerged as a 2020 campaign issue. They were a popular topic at the Democratic presidential debates, and the timing of the administration's announcement fell in the middle of the Tuesday-Wednesday cycle of debates this week.
Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been debating legislation that would allow importation of drugs to obtain cheaper prices, in addition to other measures to try to rein in costs. But leading members of Congress have said that major proposals will not be fully prepared before September.
The Trump administration is said to be considering other health care policies as the 2020 campaign approaches, but several other White House proposals to lower drug prices have faltered recently, including efforts to force drug companies to list their prices on television ads.
Canadian officials have warned their U.S. counterparts that an American importation program could jeopardize their own supply of drugs, leading to potential shortages, according to a Reuters report in July. Others have said drug companies could limit their supplies to those countries or raise their prices in response to any new U.S. policy.

Montopolis brings Texas to life in sound, from deserts to the coast

Texto completo: The brainchild of pianist, composer and arranger Justin Sherburn, Montopolis — named after the southeast Austin neighborhood he calls home — has carved out its own distinct niche in a city known for its breadth and commingling of musical styles.
The players in Montopolis have backgrounds ranging from classical to jazz to indie to punk and beyond. Under Sherburn’s direction, their talents combine to create evocative soundscapes transcending the typical concert experience.
Our Austin360 Artist of the Month for August, Montopolis will unveil its latest work, “The Living Coast,” on Friday at Stateside at the Paramount. Bolstered by a recent $15,000 Innovations Grant from the Mid-America Arts Alliance, an organization that covers six states, this new project digs into the history of the Texas coastal region. It also addresses present challenges of “the conflict between industry and our changing environment,” the MAAA noted in a July statement announcing the grant.
New this time around: Local jazz musician Robert A. Kraft, who sings most weekends at the Continental Gallery with the Lost Counts, will join the nine Montopolis instrumentalists onstage as a narrator, adding a layer of storytelling to the musical backdrop. “We’re developing it right now,” Sherburn said on a recent afternoon at Donn’s Depot, after workshop performances at the Townsend in mid-June and Carousel Lounge in early July. “He’ll be telling the story about the Galveston hurricane of 1900, a very devastating weather event.”
The book “Isaac’s Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History,” author Erik Larson’s 2000 New York Times best-seller, partly inspired this new production. “It’s a really beautiful, interesting, complicated story,” Sherburn says, noting that the hurricane
portion of the program will have archival photography from the aftermath of the Galveston storm.
“Over the last month, we just decided to just put (Kraft) on stage and have it be this more theatrical thing. In a lot of places we perform in Texas, the audience wants more of that interaction: They want a voice on stage, and a story. And I think this is going to really provide it for them, so I’m excited about that aspect.”
Montopolis first ventured into geography-centered projects when filmmaker Anlo Sepulveda commissioned Sherburn to create music for “Yakona,” which was “essentially an art film and nature documentary about the San Marcos River,” Sherburn says. “Yakona” won an audience award at the 2014 South by Southwest Film Festival, spurring Montopolis to follow up with projects that focused on Enchanted Rock and Big Bend.
Sepulveda returns as a visual collaborator on “The Living Coast,” along with drone pilot Reagan Jobe. Musically, the cast at Friday’s premiere will include Sara Nelson (Sherburn’s wife) on cello, Leigh Mahoney on violin, Blake Turner on viola, Michael St. Clair on trombone, Derek Phelps on trumpet, Andy Beaudoin on drums, Einar Pedersen on bass and Gray Parsons on guitar, with Sherburn’s keyboards in a central role.
Raised in Fort Worth, Sherburn moved to Austin in the late 1990s to get an English degree at the University of Texas. But he’d played piano for years, learning the basics from childhood lessons and from watching the pianist at a Fort Worth restaurant where he waited tables.
In Austin, he ended up living down the street from keyboardist/composer Glover Gill, an accomplished and highly respected Austin musician who’d transitioned from the early 1980s punk scene toward old-school jazz and tango with projects including the nationally renowned 8-½ Souvenirs.
Gill befriended Sherburn and eventually asked him to join 8-½ Souvenirs. After touring with them and working locally with current Shinyribs singer Alice Spencer in a group called Victrola, Sherburn eventually ended up in Austin indie band Okkervil River, playing with them for 10 years. “I just kind of bounced all over,” Sherburn says. “I think a lot of people are like this, where you just go through different stages in your life and you’re into different music, and you just kind of follow along that path.
“I played piano as a kid, and then I moved over to bass when I was a teenager because I wanted to play punk rock bands. Then I met a bunch of guys who were into the Grateful Dead and got back into the piano so I could play in this Grateful Dead cover band. And then got into jazz, and the Grateful Dead guys were like, what is this jazz stuff?” He laughs. “So I changed my friend groups and started hanging out with jazz dudes. And then got into indie rock, and I ended up playing Okkervil River.”
Montopolis first arose in 2008 when a theater-director friend asked him to write music for a stage adaptation of the French film “Le Ballon Rouge” (“The Red Balloon”). “I just loved the whole experience,” Sherburn says. “it was really successful musically and in other ways. That’s what got me started with writing music for a band. I had this combination of what you might call a Nashville chart for chords as well as a jazz chart for rhythm, and then writing out notes for the classical musicians. I’m working with country musicians, jazz musicians, classical musicians, so I just make charts that are suitable for everybody.”
Next came a silent movie score for an old Russian propaganda film called “Man With A Movie Camera.”
Several similar silent film projects followed before Sherburn met Sepulveda, whose nature film “Yakona” required similar musical needs but for different ends. “There’s no dialogue; it’s all imagery and music and sound design,” Sherburn says. “We realized there was a niche for doing that, and it kind of set me on this path that I’ve been following for the last four or five years.”
Projects like “The Living Coast” and “The Legend of Big Bend” are good fits for the realm of arts grants from agencies including the City of Austin Cultural Arts Division, which “has a huge grant program that’s really wonderful,” Sherburn says. “They ease you into that world. They’ve got very small grants you can apply for.”
The key, Sherburn says, is that the musical project “is expected to have a community aspect to it, or a public service element,” As an example, he notes that “The Living Coast” has involved working with conservation groups.
“They come to the show and speak to the audience and set up a booth,” he says. “Mostly what we do is just celebrate the beauty of nature, and then let them talk about what they want to get to the public. That’s part of why the grant-making thing works for us: We are hopefully doing this public service of bridging the gap between, say, climate scientists and conservationists and the public, because they have a real marketing problem getting their message out to the general public about initiatives.”
But these geographic focal points also inform Sherburn’s art. “I love to put myself into a context,” he says. “One of the reasons I started doing the silent movie thing, and why this art form is so appealing to me, is because it gives me something to write about. A singer-songwriter can just focus an album on a breakup or something more personal. I have to put myself into a narrative of some sort to inspire me to write music — to have a reason for, you know, why does a gong go here? Why does this melody do what it’s doing? It gives me a reason for that.”

Texto completo: The process to sell a piece of Miramax may be reaching its final act.
Several potential buyers have expressed interest in purchasing a stake in the studio, which is owned by BeIN Media Group and has produced popular and critically acclaimed films such as "Good Will Hunting" and "Pulp Fiction," according to people familiar with the matter.
Among the leading contenders to take a partnership stake in the studio are Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., Viacom Inc. and Spyglass Media Group, the people said.
Qatar-based BeIN is seeking to sell as much as 50% of the studio in a deal that would value the company at as much as $650 million, according to people familiar with the matter.
Miramax Chief Executive Bill Block and Chief Operating Officer Bob Osher, veteran entertainment executives, will stay with Miramax after the sale of the partnership stake, one of the people said.
Lions Gate, Viacom and Spyglass declined to comment.
Founded by Harvey and Bob Weinstein in 1979, Miramax in the 1990s became the best-known producer of independent film, credited with finding box-office hits in the art house and collecting a trove of Academy Awards in the process.
In today's marketplace, Miramax's library, which includes "Shakespeare in Love" and "Chicago," has renewed value as streaming services create a seller's market for programming and smaller studios look for ways to expand and better compete with Walt Disney Co. and AT&T Inc.'s Warner Bros—companies big enough to command major box-office returns and launch their own streaming services.
A group that included Colony Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority sold Miramax to BeIN in 2016 for an undisclosed amount. Colony Capital and the Qatar Investment Authority paid about $650 million to buy Miramax in 2010, years after the Weinstein brothers left Disney.
The New York Times and the New Yorker in 2017 each published accounts of alleged sexual harassment and assault by Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein, allegations that drove Mr. Weinstein out of Hollywood and helped give rise to the #MeToo movement. Mr. Weinstein, his bankrupt film studio and its former directors reached a tentative agreement earlier this year worth $44 million to resolve lawsuits and compensate alleged victims.
The proposed agreement wouldn't affect a criminal case pending against Mr. Weinstein in Manhattan, which charges him with rape and other sex crimes. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. His trial is scheduled to begin in September.
"Mr. Weinstein has said from the beginning that these are false accusations," a spokesperson for Mr. Weinstein said.
The Miramax assets could help Lions Gate bulk up in an ecosystem that many executives say requires scale, especially since the company lacks the megafranchises that competitors have.
Lions Gate already distributes the Miramax library on home entertainment.
Spyglass was launched earlier this year by Lantern Entertainment and Gary Barber, a former chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The company, built to develop and produce film and television programming, already controls more than 250 properties from Lantern's previous acquisition of the Weinstein Co. The Spyglass portfolio includes well-known films like "Inglourious Basterds" and the television show "Project Runway," and the Miramax deal could supplement that library with more titles to shop to streamers or pursue as reboots and remakes.
Viacom, which is in talks to merge with sister company CBS Corp., already releases theatrical films through its Paramount movie studio. Taking a stake in Miramax would give Viacom additional intellectual property to mine for its theatrical and TV offerings and provide some additional incremental revenue from the studio's licensing deals.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In an era of encrypted email, apps like Signal for safe texts and calls, and The New York Times's channels, there are many ways for tipsters to submit information. But some still rely on an old-fashioned and decidedly low-tech tool: the plain brown envelope.
That's what arrived by snail mail in mid-July, just before the 50th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. It had six American flag stamps and a handwritten address directing it to "Tips" at The Times's New York headquarters.
The envelope contained nearly 100 pages of documents revealing the full story of the death of the astronaut in 2012 at the age of 82 following quadruple bypass surgery. The documents showed that his two sons, Rick and Mark Armstrong, had threatened a malpractice lawsuit, prompting the hospital to pay the family $ 6 million in a secret settlement.
[Do you have a confidential tip? There are several safe ways to reach out to The Times.]
The documents included sometimes-testy emails between lawyers for the two sides, opinions of medical experts on Mr. Armstrong's treatment and records from the Ohio probate court that handled his estate.
The package was accompanied by a brief typed note: "While the health system surreptitiously tried to cover this up by requesting court documents be sealed, we felt compelled to share this information with you," the anonymous tipster wrote. "We hope others can be saved as a result of the dissemination of this information to the public because this American hero did not have to die an untimely death."
If real, such a settlement would be newsworthy for several reasons, including these two: First, just about any significant development in the life or death of a public figure of Mr. Armstrong's historic stature is news. Second, the sealing of legal settlements is an old and contentious practice, because the secrecy sometimes deprives the public of important information -- say, a potentially lethal flaw in a consumer product -- and leaves in place hazards that could be corrected.
But before we could consider publishing a story based on the documents, we would have to authenticate them. Anonymous tips are welcome, but they are also challenging: You have no idea who the source is, which means the person could be a hoaxster feeding you fabricated documents. So we were pleased to discover that the probate court records, though stamped "Filed under seal," were available online to anyone who knew where to look. They confirmed the authenticity of the submitted material. A few days after the envelope arrived at The Times, we published an article about what was inside.
That article focused on the previously-secret medical malpractice settlement, which the mailed documents described. A second article, which followed five days later, explored deep rifts within the Armstrong family over how to preserve the astronaut's legacy.
We got hints of this divide in the court documents, which revealed jostling over who should get what share of the $ 6 million settlement -- with some family members, including Mr. Armstrong's widow, choosing to take no payment at all. But getting the whole picture required interviews with the Armstrong family and the people who knew them well, like Mr. Armstrong's personal lawyer and his biographer.
That reporting showed some family members working to preserve Mr. Armstrong's legacy by working exclusively with universities and museums -- and others selling thousands of his personal items at auction, generating millions of dollars in revenue. This divide felt especially newsworthy to us in the case of Mr. Armstrong, a public figure who had often seemed reluctant to profit off his celebrity. How would a man who stopped signing autographs because he worried about the recipients selling them feel about a child's report card he'd signed being auctioned for $ 750?
We still have no idea who the tipster was. But if the person was involved in the case, there's a powerful motive to remain anonymous. Court records say that if any party to the secret settlement discloses it, all $ 6 million will have to be paid back. So if anyone on the family's side of the dispute decided to become a whistle-blower, that individual would have six million reasons not to take public credit for the tip.
But we are grateful to that tipster who dropped that envelope in the mail -- and even if we wanted to, we would have no way of discovering who it is. Unlike some newer technologies, the plain brown envelope leaves no electronic trail.

Texto completo: BERLIN -- German prosecutors on Wednesday charged Rupert Stadler, former chief executive of the Audi luxury car division of Volkswagen, with fraud for the company's role in a diesel emissions cheating scandal.
Mr. Stadler and three others who were not named were accused of developing illegal emissions software used in cars sold under the Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche brands as part of a wider effort to cheat diesel emissions tests, Munich prosecutors said in a statement.
The charges were the latest in Germany's efforts to investigate and prosecute the architects of the scandal that has rocked the country's automobile industry and laid bare the extent to which the companies tried to make diesel appear to be an environmentally friendly fuel option. The state court in Munich will now decide whether to bring the charges to trial.
The four were also charged with falsifying certificates and illegal advertising. The charges related to hundreds of thousands of Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen vehicles with engines that were rigged to limit emissions while in a test environment, but allow higher levels when on the road. The vehicles were produced between 2009 and 2015 and were sold in Germany and the United States.
Volkswagen was found in 2015 to be using software to artificially lower a vehicle's emissions levels when it was undergoing tests. In 2017, the German carmaker pleaded guilty to a vast emissions deception and agreed to pay $ 22 billion in penalties and settlements in the United States. Initially, the investigation focused only on Volkswagen, but it later widened to include other brands, including Audi, Daimler and Porsche.
Prosecutors said in a statement that Mr. Stadler had known about the manipulation "by the end of September 2015 at the latest," but continued to allow the cars to be sold or failed to take any action to prevent their sale.
Mr. Stadler's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment; in the past, Mr. Stadler has denied any wrongdoing in the scandal.
[Documents show Audi's role in the Volkswagen emissions scandal.]
Mr. Stadler, 56, served as the chief executive of Audi for more than a decade, until he was arrested in June 2018. He was held for four months before being released on bail, but with restrictions to his movements. If the Munich court agrees to take up the case and he is convicted, the former executive could face up to five years in prison, or a fine to be determined by the court.
A spokesman for Audi responded to the charges on Wednesday, saying that it was in the interest of employees, shareholders and the company for the issues surrounding the emissions cheating scandal to be legally cleared up.
Audi paid a fine of 800 million euros, then about $ 930 million, in October for its role in the scandal, as part of a civil case that was separate from the Munich prosecutors' criminal investigation of Mr. Stadler.
This year, prosecutors in Braunschweig, in northern Germany, charged a former chief executive of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, with aggravated fraud as part of a separate investigation into the cheating scandal. Mr. Winterkorn and several other Volkswagen executives also face charges brought by the Department of Justice for conspiring to rig diesel vehicles to feign compliance with American pollution standards.
Documents that were recently seen by The New York Times show that Audi managers and engineers in the Bavarian city of Ingolstadt, where the company's headquarters are, were just as willing as their counterparts at Volkswagen to cheat in pursuit of the company's goal of becoming the largest carmaker in the world -- perhaps even more so.
"We won't make it without a few dirty tricks," an employee in Audi's diesel motor development department wrote in an email to colleagues in January 2008, summarizing road tests that confirmed diesel models could not meet emissions standards.
Audi managers and engineers bluntly discussed what was in effect a criminal conspiracy, using terms, like "defeat device" and "cycle beating," that clearly connote illegal attempts to defeat the testing procedures used by regulators.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

TO BEAT DONALD TRUMP, DEMOCRATS HAD BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN PARTY; EDITOR'S COLUMN

Texto completo: How many times during the past 30 months have we seen this pattern? Donald Trump says or does something stupid or offensive, prompting days of media speculation about whether spineless Republicans in Washington, D.C., will finally repudiate him.
Next, the media rushes to produce stories from Trump-friendly communities that surprise reveal that Trump's core supporters remain behind him no matter what comes out of his mouth.
An obvious recent example is the "send her back" chant at an obnoxious Trump political rally in North Carolina. It was aimed at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, who was born in Somalia but is now a U.S. citizen.
The New York Times dutifully produced the predictable story, this time in Port Huron, Michigan, where its reporters found plenty of anecdotal support for Trump's "love it or leave it" message against Omar and three other outspoken Democratic congresswomen of color.
Here's one representative view from the story: "They happen to be black or colored," Dennis Kovach, 82, said of the women, as he watered the lawn of his home near the lake. ... "But I don't think that viewpoint is a racist viewpoint. I think it's quit the bitching, if you don't like it, do something different about it." (Um, I think that is what she is trying to do, getting elected to Congress.) Anyway, mainstream newspapers such as the Times and Washington Post, excoriated after 2016 for missing the Trump phenomenon, will apparently leave no bigot uncovered this time.
If Trump super-fans are one set of Republicans, the other is your traditional country club or chamber of commerce Republican.
So far as I can tell, Trump offers these people two things first, hefty tax cuts that are exploding the federal deficit. (Screw the next generation or two they're getting theirs.) Second, they benefit from anti-democratic actions that seek to extend the influence of conservative old white males far beyond the time they can win elections. The GOP gerrymanders, suppresses votes, and stacks the judiciary with far-right, frat-boy judges who will thwart the popular will of lawmakers for years, even decades to come, when a more multiethnic electorate chooses different leaders.
Tell me the truth. Don't you just want to ask such Republicans there are many in Madison whether they remain OK with Trump as a presidential model of morality, decency and honesty that their children and grandchildren might emulate?
I occasionally have, and Hillary Clinton's name frequently comes up. Yup, no misogyny there.
So if there are two types of Republicans, you might expect that there are two types of Democrats one organized around the passion of the far left, the other the pragmatism of the center left.
Yet a recent New York Times analysis says the party is actually split into three wings, and that satisfying all of them will be hard. Author Thomas B. Edsall was a longtime Washington Post political reporter who writes now about strategic and demographic trends in politics.
His theme was a bit jarring, especially in light of the popular image of Omar and three other first-term Democrats U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez being the best known leading the most aggressively far-left segment of the party.
Citing relevant studies,
Edsall concludes: "Democratic Party voters are split. Its most progressive wing, which is supportive of contentious policies on immigration, health care and other issues, is, in the context of the party's electorate, disproportionately white. So is the party's middle group of 'somewhat liberal' voters."
But here's the key passage: "Its more moderate wing, which is pressing bread-and-butter concerns like jobs, taxes and a less totalized vision of health care reform, is majority nonwhite, with almost half of its support coming from African-American and Hispanic voters."
It's clear that the very liberal group dominates in primaries, pushing candidates to positions on health care and immigration, for example, that might be liabilities in the general election.
Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, suggested in Edsall's article that two factors fund-raising demands and the effect of social media are turning the Democratic presidential nomination contest into "some kind of purity game to see who can be the most leftist."
He said Democratic Twitter "is dominated by overeducated, over-caffeinated, over-opinionated pain-in-the-ass white liberals. Every candidate, and every staffer, checks Twitter and other social media scores of times a day."
This three-party thesis makes sense. Many black and Hispanic voters, so vital to beating Trump, might be greatly concerned about climate change and reproductive rights, but for many of them, as well as much of the white working class, those issues are not top of mind.
Their trepidations about jobs and taxes must first be allayed.
So, in sum, you have a sizable group of bellicose Trump devotees seeing his racism as benign pranking while traditional Republicans slither around, checking their portfolios and claiming not to care about presidential morality unless, that is, the president is a Democrat.
But liberal and very liberal Democrats would do well not to stereotype moderate Democrats who fear an election debacle as timid and too willing to accept the status quo just because they prefer a non-radical agenda most focused on jobs.
Because to change the world, you first have to win.

Texto completo: High taxes forcing
flight from city
Editor: I am lifelong resident of West Scranton who loves my town and who loves and graduated from West Scranton High School, as did my children, grandchildren, relatives and friends.
However, I also am a property-tax payer and have been for 30 years. My real estate taxes are very near $7,000 annually and I can’t imagine another 3.6% school tax increase knowing that continually increasing taxes can’t solve the underlying problem. Many people complain about paying school taxes if they never had or no longer have school-age children. School taxes traditionally are predicated on the quality of the school in a particular district. This is commensurate with programs offered, test scores, graduatrion rates and the like.
Also, taxes make it possible to hire more educators with advanced degrees who can offer diversified classes. So, why is our school tax continually going up to accommodate the reckless spending and lack of oversight by the district administration and letting great teachers go, closing schools, cutting class times and eliminating programs? Want to cut back? Fire the high-salaried administrators who got us in this mess and let the state run the district.
Think of the future of our area. High taxes are pushing people out, bankrupting older adults and making our children think about living and working elsewhere.

City school crisis
action needed
Editor: As I read the July 26 article on the Scranton School District recovery plan, I was amazed that it included references to hiring, pay increases, exploring ways to raise taxes to exceed the base index and elimination of tax-discount periods.
The message I get is that officials just do not get it. I worked in education, have made and know the sacrifices required when administration mismanages money. I suggest a 7% pay reduction for all administration staff and a 3% reduction for money paid for extracurricular activities, a real hiring freeze for at least three years and a freeze on overtime. There also should be a 1.5% reduction in all retirement contributions not contractually required by the district and a freeze on all travel expenses.
If the fiscal year is to be July to June then the next year’s budget should be completed and approved by Jan. 31 and the following year budgeting should start on March 1. Detail should be required for all budget items. As for transparency, after budgets are completed, print them in the newspaper. Not every taxpayer is computer literate and may not have means to chase down documents online.
As for large discrepancies in state funding as compared to districts of similar size, why are our representatives, Rep. Marty Flynn and Sen. John Blake, not outraged and pressing hard to correct the situation immediately?
Why are cyberschools subsidized by the district and not by the state? Why not have a day or two of community support where employees other than the school district maintenance staff can pitch in and help clean up the school properties?
If teachers union leader Rosemary Boland is correct that teachers will leave if they do not receive raises, then let them go to another district.

Make access
to airport easier
Editor: As a longtime user of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport I agree with The Times-Tribune’s observation that it has finally come to life as a highly useful and convenient transportation hub for people traveling in and out of Northeast Pennsylvania (“Aggressive AVP finally finds stride,” July 27).
If only there was a way to simplify the access to drive there it would be even better. If we cannot get rid of navigating three circles to make a turn from Interstate 81 southbound to the airport, then at least better signage would help those seeking to find the terminal at night or in adverse weather.
ALOYSIUS G. CASEY
TAFTON, PIKE COUNTY
Assure safety
from cyberattacks
Editor: A July 27 New York Times news story discusses the possibility of ransomware attacks on voter databases similar to ransomware attacks on city governments in Atlanta and Baltimore.
Recently, there was a ransomware attack on the Philadelphia court system that took weeks to fix.
The New York Times story also discussed the possibility that hackers might turn off the power in certain electoral districts, thereby jeopardizing the integrity of the vote. There have been previous press reports saying that the Russians are already inside many American electric utilities. The United States must take action now to protect against these possibilities.
STANLEY WEINBERG
ELKINS PARK,
MONTGOMERY COUNTY
Affirm rule of law
Editor: Political pundits on both sides are saying that special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony “didn’t move the needle” because he neither indicted nor exonerated the president any more clearly than he already had stated in his 448-page report.
President Trump and his supporters claim victory, as predictably they would no matter what transpired. But let us ask, victory over what?
Mueller didn’t draw indictment conclusions because he was prohibited from doing so. The damning facts that he documented about Trump’s lieutenants collaborating with Russia to influence our election, and about Trump’s subsequent obstruction of the investigation, are reason enough to initiate impeachment hearings to bring the president to just accountability.
What is an appropriate response to the serious Russian attacks on our democracy and on the integrity of our self-governance? Republicans should stop playing partisan games and cooperate with Democrats to defend the rule of law and our electoral sovereignty.

Texto completo: Since at least February, DoorDash drivers have known the company was at times dipping into their tips to cover their base pay. But it wasn't until last week that the on-demand meal delivery service said it would stop.
More customers finally got wise to how their tips were being used. And they didn't like it.
Announcing plans to rethink the controversial pay structure on Twitter, Chief Executive Tony Xu indicated it was backlash from the people placing all those takeout orders -- not the ones delivering them -- that forced the concession.
"It's clear from recent feedback that we didn't strike the right balance," Xu tweeted. "We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip. What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter."
The practice first came to light earlier this year when couriers, confused about what and how they were being paid, began piecing together what little information they had as independent contractors and realized customers' tips were sometimes helping DoorDash pay them the guaranteed base pay, not just supplementing their earnings.
But it wasn't until a recent New York Times report renewed attention to the practice and sparked outrage among customers and the public.
"The new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," Xu tweeted, saying "customer obsession" was one of the company's "core values." "We'll have specific details in the coming days."
The company's acknowledgment is a stark about-face from when driver and tech worker backlash prompted San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin to ask the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to investigate DoorDash for a potential labor violation in February. In an interview with Fast Company at the time, DoorDash said "we believe our model best serves both Dashers and customers. Since implementing this pay model in 2017, Dasher retention and overall satisfaction have increased significantly while average delivery times have decreased."
Gig Workers Rising, a San Francisco group that represents on-demand laborers, tweeted it was "remarkable" Xu attributed the reason for the policy change to customers and not to the drivers who first complained about misuse of their tips.
"It was highly disrespectful of (Xu) to dismiss drivers when he announced this policy change," Shona Clarkson, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, said in a statement. "He should have proactively said he would repay the wages taken from their workers. Instead, DoorDash will have pocketed millions of dollars taken from customer tips."
DoorDash isn't alone in the practice. As the Los Angeles Times first revealed in February, Amazon was in some cases using customer tips to guarantee Flex drivers' base pay. Amazon did not respond to questions about whether the company is considering changing its policy. Another company making use of this practice, Instacart, gave in to pressure and quickly changed its policy when it was called out by drivers in February, as BuzzFeed News first reported.
As is often the case, independent contractors who work for gig economy companies are left to do the extra work of cobbling together the meager information these companies give them to understand how they operate. While DoorDash said it indicated in its FAQ that tips were sometimes added to meet pay guarantees, the language is confusing and ambiguous enough that it's not immediately clear how tips are used.
"For each delivery, you will earn at least $1 plus customer tip, but DoorDash will ensure that your total earnings (including tips) are never less than the amount you're guaranteed when you're offered a delivery," the FAQ reads.
It later says: "When base pay plus tip is more than the guaranteed minimum, you keep that larger amount."
Workers across the gig economy demanding answers have long had to settle for templated responses from customer support representatives.
Responding to questions about tips from Flex drivers, Amazon, in emails obtained by The Times, repeatedly stated that drivers received 100% of tips but also that they "add any supplemental earnings required to meet our commitment that delivery partners earn $18-$25 per hour."
In lieu of clear and direct communications from companies, many gig workers turn to online forums and groups, looking for others who might have more information and banding together to trade documents and tips to ensure they are receiving what they have been promised. Some turn to creative sleuthing to get clear answers.
The asymmetry in information, fragmented nature of the workforce and fear of retaliation make it possible for companies like DoorDash and Amazon to implement questionable labor practices like these, often without significant pushback. Every so often, however, the same decentralized network dynamics can put companies in the midst of a bad PR blizzard they can't control -- as DoorDash learned last week.

Hopkins earns scorn, some Jewish support, for her attacks on Muslims

Texto completo: To her critics, British journalist Katie Hopkins is less an anti-immigrant activist than a flat-out Islamophobe, demonizing Islam in defense of what she calls "White Brits."
Such views have earned her scathing criticism and rejection by leaders of British Jewry.
But on the ground in the United Kingdom, Hopkins' engagement with parts of the Jewish community and other minorities, as well as her growing focus and action on Israel, have earned her numerous Jewish supporters.
In an article, The New York Times noted that President Donald Trump, already under fire for a tweet targeting, among others, two Muslim-American lawmakers, retweeted an endorsement of him by Hopkins. The Times characterized Hopkins as "a right-wing British commentator who has drawn repeated condemnation over a long history of anti-Muslim remarks and for casting blame on a Jewish leader for provoking a synagogue shooting."
Indeed, Hopkins suggested last year on Twitter that British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis' favorable views on immigration were somehow connected to the slaying last year of 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh shooter had written that he was enraged by the pro-immigration policies of a Jewish group and others.
Don't blame Trump, Hopkins wrote. Rather, "Look to the Chief Rabbi and his support for mass migration across the Med[iterranean]," she wrote. "There you will find your truths."
The Times also wrote about her many criticisms of Islam and use of the term "final solution" to describe what needs to happen in Manchester - presumably, to Muslims - following a terrorist attack there in 2017.
But Hopkins, 44, also represents the meeting place of far-right European nationalism and pro-Israel sentiment. In fact, she has been criticized by some on the far right for allegedly embracing Israel. Meanwhile, some on the left say she's done this to whitewash her own anti-Muslim racism and even anti-Semitism.
"It feel like it's [Israel is] kind of my natural home," Hopkins said in Tel Aviv last year to an audience that had gathered for a screening of her documentary film "Homelands" about the flight of Christians and Jews from Europe. Hopkins, who has 969,000 followers on Twitter, then said, "It's my ambition to be Jewish."
She recalled telling an Israeli cab driver who asked whether she was Jewish.
"No," she said, "I got the nose but not the Jewish bit."
Hopkins, a former branding professional for the British meteorological service, gained fame in 2007 with her appearance on the British edition of "The Apprentice" reality television show. She also said in the Tel Aviv speech: "All of my friends are Jewish, I hope I'll get through osmosis if I rub up against them enough."
Such comments did not go unnoticed among neo-Nazis who otherwise relish her calling immigrants arriving on boats "cockroaches" that should be stopped by "gunboats," or her journalistic focus on "White Brits" who are "becoming a minority" in neighborhoods and towns that are becoming predominantly Muslim, as she explains in "Homelands."
"Alas but she loves Jews if I recall," one user of the neo-Nazi website Stormfront wrote last year.
Another user wrote: "She's what most people here would call 'alt-lite.' She's part of the Jew Ezra Levant's Rebel Media now." It was a reference to the Canadian media website to which she used to contribute.
Hopkins began writing there following her dismissal from LBC Radio over the "final solution" tweet. (Amid an outcry, she deleted the tweet and said she ought to have written 'true solution' not to be 'disrespectful to the survivors in Manchester.'")
Hopkins, who declined to be interviewed for this article, also deleted her tweet about the synagogue shooting.
Following the Chief Rabbi tweet, she quickly deleted the quote and offered something resembling an apology - an action that Hopkins, a mother of three, has said she does not believe in.
"I have never apologized for anything I've said," Hopkins said in 2015. "I find it very disappointing when people apologize. You should have the positive moral attitude to stand by what you say."
Jonathan Hoffman, a former vice president of Britain's Zionist Federation, traces Hopkins' growing interest in Israel and Jews partly to her viewing European Jews as canaries in the coal mine - the first targets of Muslim hardliners she fears will eventually target other groups in their adoptive countries.
"I think she genuinely sees the fact that with Israel, Jews have somewhere to run to," Hoffman told JTA.
He added: "I think it's a conspiracy theory, this idea that she's using Israel or the Jewish community as some kind of prop to support her anti-Muslim behavior. I don't buy that. I don't think she's that clever, actually."
But Hoffman does not believe that it would be appropriate for any Jewish group to host Hopkins as a speaker because "she's crossed the line into racism" in her rhetoric about White Brits vs. Muslims.
"I don't hear anyone from the Jewish community speaking like that, not even on the right fringes," he said. (Hopkins attended a Zionist Federation fundraiser in London last year as another guest's plus one. The federation apologized for hosting her, explaining it did not plan to.)
The Board of Deputies of British Jews has been one of Hopkins' most outspoken critics and has decried the support shown to her by some British Jews.
After the right-leaning Jewish group Campaign 4 Truth hosted Hopkins for a screening earlier this month of "Homelands," the board's president, Marie van der Zyl, tweeted: "This vile Muslim-baiting film should never have seen the light of day. Shame on those who hosted and promoted such an event."
The film transitions between non-Jewish Europeans' fear about Islam to the decisions by Jews who left France amid anti-Semitic violence that watchdog groups say is fueled almost entirely by Muslim extremists.
Hopkins was scheduled to screen the film this year in Israel, but the event was canceled after the municipality of Raanana pulled the plug.
Though he disagrees with the premise and terminology of Hopkins' film, Hoffman says he can see its internal logic, which he argues is also the reason that Hopkins has recently focused on Israel in her documentary and beyond.
"If you believe in the idea that Europe is doomed, which I don't think I do, then it's a reasonable point to make: Jews have somewhere to run to, non-Jews don't," Hoffman said.

Capital One embraced cloud, but that couldn't stop hack

Texto completo: Hole in the bank'sown firewall led tomajor data breach
In 2015, Capital One's chief information officer, Rob Alexander, promoted the steps the bank had taken to protect its financial data. In his keynote address at an Amazon Web Services conference, Alexander said Capital One had looked to AWS to meet customer demand, cut back on its data centers and boost security, especially since "the financial services industry attracts some of the worst cybercriminals."
Four years later, Capital One was ensnared in one of the largest-ever hacks of a big financial institution. And in the end, its embrace of cloud services could not save roughly 100 million credit card applicants in the United States from their data being compromised.
Federal agents in Seattle arrested Paige A. Thompson, 33, who was accused this week of breaking through a misconfigured Capital One firewall. The hole meant a hacker could reach the server where Capital One was storing its information and access customer data.
Amazon told the New York Times that its cloud had stored the Capital One data. But the bank said that "this type of vulnerability is not specific to the cloud," noting it was able to quickly diagnose and fix the issue because of its "cloud operating model." Amazon told the Times that it found no evidence that its underlying cloud services were compromised.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
On Monday, the Virginia-based bank said a hacker had accessed roughly 100 million credit card applications. Federal prosecutors say the breach also included 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers, culled from tens of millions of credit card applications. Capital One said the data came from applications that customers and small businesses submitted from 2005 to early 2019. The bank said the hack will cost the company $100 million to $150 million in the near term.
The hack comes just days after Equifax, a credit reporting company, announced it had reached a $700 million settlement with federal regulators over a 2017 cyberattack that exposed the personal information of 147 million people.
Capital One has been a leading advocate in the banking world for cloud services. The company is migrating more of its applications and data to the cloud, Bloomberg reported, and plans to be done with its data centers by the end of 2020. Other financial companies have been more wary of cloud services, largely for security reasons.
Cloud-hosting services such as AWS are attractive to companies looking to cut costs, said Jonathan Stone, chief technology officer for the IT consulting firm Kelser. Building and running data centers carries a hefty price tag, often tens of millions of dollars. But with a third-party service, "you can be an expert in your business and not necessarily have to know how all the plumbing works," Stone said.
That assurance did not protect Capital One from its own firewall issue, which federal officials say allowed the hacker to break through. Thompson was an AWS employee who last worked at Amazon in 2016, a company spokesman told Bloomberg. The spokesman said the breach Capital One described did not require insider knowledge.
Though the bank missed the firewall issue on its own, it moved quickly to remedy it, Stone said. But the hack also raises questions about how companies handle and store historical data, such as credit card applications going back more than a decade. "The more stuff you have laying around," Stone said, "the more chance you have of something bad happening with it."

Texto completo: Juan Rodríguez (39) sobrevivió a la guerra de Irak, pero nada se compara con la pesadilla que está viviendo desde la tarde del viernes, cuando descubrió que un “descuido” suyo había acabado con la vida de sus gemelos de un año de edad, asados de calor tras ser olvidados dentro de su auto en el estacionamiento del hospital donde trabaja en El Bronx (NYC).
Desde entonces Rodríguez ha estado tratando de comprender cómo pudo dejado a su hijo mayor de 4 años en su guardería y haber olvidado hacer lo propio con los gemelos en su otro centro de cuidado. Y, peor aún, cómo pasó 8 horas en el trabajo sin recordar que los bebés estaban encerrados en su auto.
Algunos se preguntan si esa “laguna mental” no es consecuencia de su experiencia militar. De hecho, en el Hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge labora como trabajador social ayudando a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
El sábado quedó en libertad bajo fianza, con cargos de homicidio involuntario.
Angustiado, le dijo a un amigo cercano que creía que había dejado a los niños en su guardería, a pesar de que no lo había hecho. “No podía explicarlo”, dijo el amigo Alfredo Angueira. “En su mente los dejó”.
El domingo, Rodríguez llamó a David Diamond, un profesor de psicología en Florida que estudia por qué los padres pueden olvidar a sus hijos en los automóviles.
Rodríguez no podía entender su propio lapso de memoria. “Pensó que era la única persona que había hecho” algo así, dijo el Dr. Diamond en una entrevista a The New York Times.
El Dr. Diamond le aclaró a Rodríguez que cientos de otros padres también han dejado a sus hijos en autos calientes, con resultados igualmente trágicos. Le ha sucedido a médicos, contadores, maestros.
Desde 1998, alrededor de 440 niños en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, dijo Diamond.
“Creo que esto lo ha ayudado en su momento de duelo”, dijo, “para comprender cómo es posible que pudo haber hecho eso”.
Rodríguez no ha hablado públicamente, pero los comentarios de Angueira y el Dr. Diamond ofrecieron las primeras ideas sobre cómo está lidiando con la devastadora realidad de haber dejado morir a sus hijos.
Rodríguez, quien vive en el condado Rockland (NY), al salir del trabajo regresó al auto a las 4 p.m. Sólo se dio cuenta de que los bebés estaban dentro después de que comenzó a manejar unas cuadras, afirmó.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca .
Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un accidente horrible. El domingo dijo en un comunicado que las muertes de sus bebés Luna y Phoenix han sido “mi peor pesadilla”.

Texto completo: August has traditionally had a reputation for being one of the slowest months in the publishing business, with industry workers heading out on long vacations to escape the heat and humidity of a New York City summer. But you wouldn't know it from this year's crop of August books, which includes some of the most exciting titles of the year so far. If you're looking for reading material to take your mind off the heat, or to help you celebrate the last few weeks before school starts, consider picking up one of these seven highly anticipated August books:
"The Yellow House," Sarah M. Broom: The memoir from Louisiana native Broom tells the story of her mother's beloved shotgun house in east New Orleans and the family she raised there. The house was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, and Broom writes about the racial and economic inequality that has haunted New Orleans for decades. Author Heidi Julavits called the book "a masterpiece of history, politics, sociology and memory."
"A Good Provider Is One Who Leaves: One Family and Migration in the 21st Century," Jason DeParle: This New York Times reporter, twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, chronicles multiple generations of a family living in the Philippines, including Rosalie, who moves from Manila to the Middle East to Galveston, Texas, where she's able to find a job as a nurse. The book takes a look at the politics and the personal effects of global immigration.

"Hard Mouth," Amanda Goldblatt: Chicago author Goldblatt's debut novel follows Denny, a lab tech living near Washington, whose father is dying of cancer. Denny, unable to handle the news, flees to a cabin in the mountains but finds her dream of living away from society isn't what she thought it would be.
"100 Poems," Seamus Heaney: Beloved Irish writer Heaney left a huge hole in the world of poetry when he died in 2013. This new book collects 100 poems from various points in his long, storied career; the collection is curated by his family.
"Miami Midnight," Alex Segura: Comic book writer and novelist Segura's latest novel is the fifth and final installment in his series of thrillers featuring private investigator Pete Fernandez. In this one, Fernandez has given up both drinking and detective work, but finds himself pulled back into the private-eye life when a mobster asks him to track down his son's murderer.
"Black Card," Chris L. Terry: The darkly satirical second novel from L.A. writer Terry follows an unnamed biracial punk rock musician living in Richmond, Va., who feels disconnected from the African American community. When the protagonist fails to call out a white man for using a racial slur, his "black card" is revoked by his mentor, and he embarks on a quest to get it back.
"Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion," Jia Tolentino: Canadian-born, Texas-raised journalist Tolentino, a veteran of the Hairpin and Jezebel who now writes for the New Yorker, is one of the brightest cultural critics of her generation. Her new essay collection finds her writing about the internet, millennials, feminism and religion.

Texto completo: Richard Liebson, the quintessential crime-and-fires reporter, who for more than 30 years at The Journal News/lohud told the stories of police and firefighters, criminals and victims, military veterans, the down-and-out and so many unsung regular folks not unlike himself, died early Sunday at his White Plains home. He was 61.
He had cancer for about two years. But Liebson didn't want anyone to say that he battled the disease or that he was brave in the end. He saw and wrote about too much real suffering for that, and said that he himself lived a great, fulfilling life. Cancer just got him, like it got so many others.
Liebson was long one of The Journal News' best-known writers and characters, a beat reporter of the old school who chatted up sources on his off hours, huddled with people burned out of their homes, distrusted authority figures (and anyone who didn't answer a question directly), and managed to find the humanity in the most hard-bitten crime stories. In recent years, he covered the City of White Plains, tracking the city's business development and politics, even if he liked visiting police headquarters and the courts best of all.
"Rich was a smart, hardworking reporter and lucid storyteller who was admired by everyone in the newsroom for his trusted and generous counsel and infectious love of journalism," said Mary Dolan, editor of The Journal News/lohud.
Liebson covered many of the high-profile stories that hit the region, from the 1994 propane-truck explosion in White Plains to a sniper's killing of Eastchester Police Officer Michael Frey in 1996 to the fatal shooting of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. by White Plains police after Chamberlain accidentally triggered a life-alert alarm in 2011. But he took the most pleasure in describing how ordinary firefighters pulled grandma from a second-story window at 3 a.m., or revealing how sleepless detectives found the clue to crack a case, or recalling the forgotten heroics of military veterans, from the Battle of the Bulge to Iraq.
"He was one of the most genuine and unselfish people I've ever known," said Jorge Fitz-Gibbon, a longtime colleague at The Journal News. "He touched more lives than even he knew."
A proud military brat Liebson was a proud military brat who was born on Jan. 14, 1958, in Landstuhl, Germany and grew up on bases in Germany and the U.S. His father, Joseph Liebson, an Air Force master sergeant and plane mechanic, served in Vietnam and Thailand, and died from cancer in 1982 at 47 years of age. He had been regularly exposed to Agent Orange.
Liebson graduated from Valhalla High School in 1976. He served in the Army from 1976 to 1980, "writing for Stars and Stripes," making lifelong buddies, and coming away with many great stories, that he told again and again, about the shaky early days of the all-volunteer Army.
He was hired as a part-time reporter by what was then Westchester Rockland Newspapers in 1983 — and got a kick out of knowing he was among the last to enter the newspaper business without a college degree. He went on to do just about everything at The Journal News, including a dissatisfied stint as an editor (or "desk jockey," as he would say) and a much happier period as a weekly columnist. He also developed into one of The Journal News' go-to rewrite people, because he could translate complex policies into direct language that got to the heart of a matter without dumbing it down.
Liebson had his own ways of doing things. He sported a Fu Manchu mustache for much of the '90s, and often wore ill-fitting jeans or sweatpants on the job, even as he carried a leather suitcase from story to story. He walked with a pronounced limp for the last 20 years or so because he hadn't seen the sense in rehabbing old football injuries. And he never, ever drove anywhere without his Jets hat on.
He was an always-optimistic fan of the Jets and Mets, a devotee of Muhammad Ali and Bob Dylan, and a lifelong student of Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday his family learned to observe each year. He loved history, especially the Civil War, but was equally fascinated by local history and valued his time with local historians. Liebson was an authority on the Battle of White Plains and his definitive history of the battle hung in Westchester classrooms for many years.
Mentoring the young Liebson served as a mentor to dozens of young reporters, including his daughter, Rebecca Liebson, now a fellow at The New York Times. Doing so came easy because his enthusiasm for reporting never waned. He thought it was a privilege to help expose wrongdoing and tell the stories of unknown community heroes. In fact, after filing particularly rewarding stories throughout his career, Liebson would often turn to a colleague and say "I can't believe they pay me to do this."
As Rebecca wrote on Facebook, "My dad was one of the few people I know who was legitimately satisfied with what he had. He was a scrappy Air Force brat without a college degree that had somehow ended up with family and friends who loved him and his dream job as a reporter. He didn't need to seek outside validation because in his eyes he had already made it."
Liebson married Victoria Hochman on June 15, 1996. Hochman is a former editor for The Journal News and Newsday and is now manager of public relations for Thompson & Bender.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Morgan Shelby and Rebecca Liebson of White Plains; two brothers, Bruce Liebson of Greenwich, and David Liebson of Carmel; and two sisters, Liza Liebson and Laura Liebson of Acapulco, Mexico.
Visitation will be Tuesday from 4 to 6 p.m. at Ballard-Durand Funeral Home in White Plains. A memorial service will follow at 6. Liebson requested that no one wear ties.
Richard Liebson, one of The Journal News/lohud's best-known reporters and characters, died on Sunday.

From rescue cat to big star

Texto completo: Taking a back seat to the Apollo 11 moon landing in our coverage of things celebrating a 50th anniversary this year leaves Morris the Cat in uncharted territory.
"He was a TV star," says Tom Van Winkle, executive director of the Hinsdale Humane Society, where the advertising feline was discovered. Morris became a household name in 1969 by strutting his stuff in the first of 58 commercials for 9Lives. "It’s pretty amazing how it still resonates with people," Van Winkle says.
It’s likely that Morris was surrendered by his owner or possibly rescued off the street in 1968. But the orange-striped Tabby won over animal trainer and handler Bob Martwick of Lombard, who stopped by the shelter in Hinsdale looking for a cat to appear in commercials for 9Lives cat food. Martwick brought the calm, some would say aloof, stray cat to a meeting with the creative team at the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago, and Morris made an unforgettable impression.
"He jumped on the table … and he walked right up to the art director, the big cheese, and bumped him in the head. And then Morris just sat back," Martwick said during his many media interviews about the cat. "The art director said, ‘This is the Clark Gable of cats.’" Voiced by actor John Erwin, who also provided the voice for the popular He-Man cartoon character in the 1980s, Morris was the wisecracking, sardonic, finicky cat, who had little tolerance for anything except 9Lives cat food.
"Oh, I remember the Morris commercials. He definitely had a special personality that most cats don’t have," says Van Winkle, who now has enough Morris goodies at the Hinsdale Humane Society for a Morris shrine.
"This is a portrait from 1974," Van Winkle says of a large framed photograph of Morris that was taken in the photo studio at the L.S. Ayres department store in Indianapolis during one of the cat’s celebrity appearances.
"This was made by the company that makes the Emmy," he says, showing off a golden trophy in the image of Morris.
That trophy was given to one of nine cats from around the nation competing to be the 9Lives cat of the year in a lavish competition held in the famed Beverly Hills Hotel. Celebrity judges included Betty White and Ed Asner, remembers Jennifer Petterson, who started her public relations career in the 1980s with the third generation of Morris the Cat as part of her work with the Edelman communications firm of Chicago. Petterson and her staff flew in coach and carried the director’s chair with "Morris" written across the back, while Martwick and Morris, in a carrier tucked under the seat, flew first-class.
"You could see tufts of his fur through the carrier," remembers Petterson, who now lives in La Grange. "You didn’t dare say who he was because people would go gaga."
Petterson, who now runs her pettersonpr.com consulting firm, was one of a select few who got to hold Morris, aside from Martwick. A no-nonsense guy who still kept the crew cut he wore as a Navy pilot during World War II, Martwick also helped discover Spuds MacKenzie, the beer-selling dog of Anheuser-Busch.
"He was a lovely man, but was quiet and looked stern," says Petterson, who also worked with dog stars such as Beethoven, Lassie and the dog on "Frasier."
The original Morris died in July of 1978 at the age of 17, and his obituary in The New York Times noted Morris was "laid to rest near Mr. Martwick’s home," apparently in a backyard ceremony befitting his unpretentious roots. Martwick died in 2001 at age 75.
All subsequent replacement look-alike Morrises have been rescue cats, and the current Morris can be found on Twitter at @MorrisApproved, on Facebook, and on YouTube with his "Cat’s Eye View" on the 9Lives Cat Food channel, which notes that "America’s choosiest cat gives back" in an effort to "Live Well & Prospurr."
In 2015, Morris was one of 10 brand mascots alongside the Green Giant, Ronald McDonald, Mr. Clean and others to be honored with "A Salute to Advertising’s Greatest Icons" at the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago.
During his half-century career, Morris has received thousands of fan letters, and included his paw print on his responses. He endured countless puns about his purrfect life and his catapulting to stardom. He traveled the nation, promoting feline health and animal shelters, and visiting hospitals and schools. A later Morris launched his "Morris for President" campaign in 1988 by stumping with Eleanor Mondale, took a second shot at the White House in 2012, and might actually win if he joins the 2020 race.
The original Morris had a part in Robert Altman’s 1973 film, "The Long Goodbye," and appeared alongside Burt Reynolds and Dyan Cannon in "Shamus." Morris also is listed as the author of three books.
In addition to selling cat food, later versions of Morris worked with the American Veterinary Medical Association in Schaumburg in establishing February as Cat Health Month, and led the Morris Million Cat Rescue adoption campaign in 2006.
That activism for less fortunate cats helps explain why Morris is so fondly remembered today.
"It’s still a sense of pride for the shelter and the community that this famous cat came from us," Van Winkle says. "It’s pride for the whole community because a rescue animal made it big."

Texto completo: Ghosts
At Williamstown Theatre Festival, Main Stage, Williamstown,
July 31-Aug. 18. Tickets $75, 413-458-3253, www.wtfestival.org
Uma Thurman has carved out a three-decade career in Hollywood by combining go-for-broke fierceness with preternatural poise and a formidable intellect. The actress, who was born in Boston and grew up in Amherst, has been known as the sultry femme fatale in “Pulp Fiction," an indie queen who rejected easy-money blockbusters in order to play complex roles in films like “Henry & June" and “Hysterical Blindness," and the butt-kicking, sword-wielding star of Quentin Tarantino's “Kill Bill" diptych.
But as an over-40 actress in Hollywood, Thurman has also faced the prospect of dwindling roles worthy of her talent. So she began to look elsewhere for substantive parts. Two years ago, that led her to take on a different challenge — headlining a new play on Broadway, “The Parisian Woman," written by Beau Willimon, creator of the American version of “House of Cards." It was her first stage role in nearly 20 years.
In a phone interview, Thurman, 49, says the psychic pressure of doing live theater and carrying a new play with your name on the marquee was especially difficult — especially when said play is greeted with middling reviews.
“Getting through the full-length run of a Broadway show is Herculean. It was like an initiation-by-fire," Thurman says, while driving back from rehearsal at Tanglewood, where she appeared last week as the narrator in the world premiere of “Penelope," by the late composer Andre Previn, with text by Tom Stoppard. “It's difficult, the whole sort of brutality of 'is Broadway going to accept you or repel you?' You know, if you can make it on Broadway, you can make it anywhere. It could break a human being, especially doing it for the first time.
“But it was also a great experience in a lot of ways, and I'm very glad that I did it," says the actress.
Despite the bumpy ride, Thurman remains undaunted, and she's heading back to the stage again, this time in the nurturing confines of the Williamstown Theatre Festival in the Berkshires, not far from her “old stomping grounds," playing the widowed Mrs. Alving in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's late 19th-century drama “Ghosts." The play, directed by Carey Perloff in a translation by Paul Walsh, runs July 31 through Aug. 18.
The project came about when Thurman and Williamstown artistic director Mandy Greenfield hit it off after meeting through a mutual friend. They began discussing potential projects, and Greenfield would send her new plays to read. But nothing stuck. Then Greenfield asked how she felt about Ibsen and “Ghosts," and Thurman's ears immediately perked up.
“Ibsen's work, having studied it in high school a bit, was one of the things that drew me to want to be an actress," she says. “Ibsen's women are so fascinating and deep and complicated and truly require every scrap of talent one has to get through them."
When “Ghosts" premiered in 1882, it was greeted with scorn and disgust, denounced because of its candid discussions of marital infidelity, sexuality, venereal disease, euthanasia, and the liberation of women. Moreover, Ibsen had offered a scathing indictment of Norwegian society's oppressive social strictures and its moral decay to protect those social norms.
Set in a country house, the play centers on the widowed Mrs. Alving, who is trying to free herself from the ghosts of her past. Despite her husband's philandering, she had sought to preserve the troubled marriage and prevent scandal from tainting her family. She had even sent away her son, Oswald, to boarding school when he was young in order to protect him from the reality of his father's debauched life.
As the play begins, Mrs. Alving is preparing to open an orphanage she's built in her deceased husband's name. Oswald, now grown, has returned home after years living abroad and fashioning a life as a bohemian artist, but he has a couple of troubling secrets to share with his mother. Meanwhile, Pastor Manders, who was Mrs. Alving's paramour many years earlier before he forced her to return to her husband, is overseeing the construction of the orphanage.
Director Perloff points out that Ibsen created Mrs. Alving as a response to the scandal provoked by “A Doll's House" two years before. At the end of that play, Nora Helmer famously walks out on her family and her oppressive marriage.
“To some extent, Mrs. Alving is the answer to Nora, because Mrs. Alving tried to leave her home and leave her husband, but was forced back again," Thurman says. “So Mrs. Alving is the result of a failed attempt to escape an abusive and destructive household."
Since her husband's death, Mrs. Alving has had an awakening. She's yearning for independence and rejects the opinions, customs, and social mores of the time. “She's a character who's in a sort of spiritual crisis," Thurman says. “She's doubting the teachings of the church and questioning all of the conventions of society — that a wife has a duty to stay with her husband no matter what. So she's rejecting society in some way and is being treated [by the Pastor] as if she's falling out of line with social norms. That must have been quite threatening at the time."
Perloff says “Ghosts" also examines the “ferocious attachment" that a mother feels for her son, but also “tragically how little she really knows him."
“In one sense, she made this ultimate sacrifice to save him, but in another sense she abandoned him. It's so complex," Thurman says. “That relationship is one of the things that's so relevant and eternal about the play."
Indeed, Perloff says, “Uma understands the complexity of what it means to be a mother. She has three children who she"s passionate about. When we started talking, I knew right away this was not going to be an abstract struggle to her."
He says “Ghosts" examines the friction between holding onto our ideals and beliefs versus telling the truth. “Ibsen was really probing that conflict — the danger of telling the truth coupled with the necessity of telling the truth."
“How much of the truth is healthy for a person and how many secrets can someone live with without being sickened by them?" Thurman says. “These things are things that I think everybody struggles with."
Indeed, in early 2018 the actress told her own very dark truth, in a revelatory New York Times interview, about being sexually assaulted by her onetime champion, disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, her anger at his industry enablers, and suffering lasting injuries in a car accident on the set of “Kill Bill" after feeling pressured by Tarantino to perform the stunt herself.
While she acknowledges that letting out the truth was cathartic, she insists she doesn't want anyone to pity her. That Zen outlook can no doubt be traced to her upbringing by a father, Robert Thurman, who's one of the world's foremost Buddhist scholars and a longtime friend of the Dalai Lama.
“I've been extremely fortunate," she says, “and I think I'm probably most fortunate for having the courage to just try to move forward, try to take another step, and try not to let things overcome me — to be brave."

Texto completo: In a lifetime of record-setting accomplishments, those who knew Bob Arrix best will tell you that there are still a few standouts.

Arrix, who died July 20 in Connecticut, was known for his generous spirit and infectious sense of humor. A football star at the University of Notre Dame, he was a member of the 1953 National Championship team led by Frank Leahy. According to his obituary, during his sophomore year for the Irish, Arrix set a modern school record for field goals, including a key three-pointer against USC to cement a 9-0 victory in one of the most dramatic games ever played in South Bend.

He was also a pioneer in sports marketing, having started Capital Sports in 1973, a firm that would help redefine how brands integrated with sporting events. A few years later, Arrix served as the catalyst behind the Bausch & Lomb Tennis Championships. Begun in 1980, it became one of the most popular events of the Women's Tennis Association tour.

His son, John Arrix, believes it was one of the most gratifying projects his father ever created.

"His greatest years were spent working on that tournament," he said. "It was an incredibly unique venue and some truly big-time players participated; basically every women's champion there was."

Indeed, from its inception as the Murjani WTA Championships through more than two decades as the Bausch & Lomb Championships (starting in 1987) and on up to its final tournament under the MPS Group in 2010, the event drew some of the biggest names in women's tennis: Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navrotilova, Tracy Austin, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Venus and Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova -- all graced the local tournament courts. First at Amelia Island Plantation, where it was held until 2000, when it moved to Sawgrass Country Club.

The event reportedly started with an ad in the New York Times.

"He was working on marketing for the U.S. Open in late 1970s, and was knee-deep in the Federation Cup with Billie Jean King," said John Arrix, who joined his father's company in 1985 after graduating from college and eventually became tournament director for the Bausch & Lomb Championships. "He saw this ad in the Sunday Times for Amelia Island Plantation, and said the family should take a vacation there."

So, Bob Arrix, his wife, Cate, and their six children took off for the pristine shores of Amelia Island. This was 1979, and during the visit, he was introduced to the resort's then-owners, Dick Cooper and Jack Healan. The senior Arrix casually asked the two men what they thought about bringing a tournament to the still-remote locale.

They were on board, and the first tournament was held the following year.

More so than the longevity of the event, or the famous players drawn to it, what most remember is the joie de vivre exhibited by its chairman.

Annabelle Hudmon, director of corporate accounts and special events for the Bausch & Lomb Championships from 1980 to 1992, called her involvement with the tournament "a great adventure."

"Bob was such a great leader and he inspired you to do your very best. He had a great sense of humor and as my mother would say a ‘personality A+,'" said Hudmon. "He would not hesitate to say, ‘Annabelle, Tracy Austin is coming to the tournament, would you find her a place [to] sit and watch the matches when she is not playing? How about your box seat!' Such great times."

Much like The Players Championship, the tennis tournament also served as a vehicle for supporting various charities. When Capital Sports first came to the area to plan the tournament, the company partnered with the Junior League of Jacksonville as the primary beneficiary organization, a relationship that lasted at least five years.

The group was in the process of buying its first property, Riverside House, when Julia Taylor, then-president of the Junior League, was approached by the president of Barnett Bank, who asked if they would like to make some money. She remembers the experience "as if it were yesterday," and of great benefit to everyone involved.

Taylor described Arrix as the kind of person who would never hesitate to help a volunteer or staff member in a tight spot -- someone stranded with car trouble, for example. She added that the city welcomed him and his company with open arms, and that he reciprocated in kind.

"He had such a wonderful, positive attitude and made every one of us feel important to the cause," she said. "Not everyone can pull that off, and it was crucial to our success."

Sandra Kavanaugh, who served as director of public relations and media for the tournament from 1985 through 2010, remembers Bob Arrix bounding through the doors of the tournament office after driving down from Connecticut with Cate, hair blown in all directions and wearing an enormous smile. She recalled being amazed that he seemed to always know someone in the room, no matter where he went.

"I will always cherish the memories and then smile when I think of Bob Arrix," said Kavanaugh, now a special projects manager with the St. Johns County Chamber of Commerce, Ponte Vedra Beach division. "That's what Bob would like."

Steve Simon, WTA Chairman and CEO, released a statement highlighting the contributions made by Arrix and company.

"It is thanks to leaders like Bob Arrix that the WTA is the global success story it is today," the statement read in part. "The Bausch & Lomb Championships at Amelia Island are fondly remembered as among the best run and most enjoyable stops on the tour, and that is largely due to Bob's commitment as promoter and tournament director over the course of many years."

Simon's statement also expressed sincere condolences to "Bob's wife, Cate and all his loved ones."

He wasn't the only one. On Tuesday, John Arrix received an email from Billie Jean King, expressing her condolences but also praising his father for the work he did in support of women's sports and gender equality.

As he pointed out, the issue of pay inequities in professional sports are "not a ‘done' topic," as illustrated by the recent Women's World Cup.

"Women's tennis helped pave the way, thanks to a lot of hard work by some dedicated people. Now prize money for the Grand Slam is equal for men and women's tennis," said John Arrix. "It's really cool that my dad was a part of that."

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Información de publicación: Whittier Daily News ; Whittier, Calif. [Whittier, Calif]. 26 July 2019.

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Newsday workers offered voluntary buyouts

Texto completo: Newsday Media Group is offering voluntary buyouts to some employees as it adds television, more multimedia products and live events to producing newspapers and websites, executives said Thursday.
The company, with headquarters in Melville, hasn't yet determined how many buyouts will be granted in a workforce that totals about 840 people.
The buyout offer consists of three weeks' pay for every year of service, up to 65 weeks.
The eligible employees work in Newsday's newsroom, advertising, marketing and finance departments. Employees of the commuter paper amNewYork are not eligible, officials said.
"Newsday is transforming from a traditional newspaper into a leading-edge multimedia and multiplatform content-generation machine, with expanded video, exciting live events and experiences for subscribers," said company spokeswoman Kim Como.
She noted the new headquarters building that the company will move to next month, also in Melville, features a television studio and theater equipped for live broadcasts.
"As we evolve, our staffing needs will continue to change," Como said. "We will be needing more people in some areas and fewer in others...Right now we are actively recruiting applicants to fill over 30 positions including new positions for video journalists and producers."
Michael LaSpina, president of Local 406 of the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents some of the affected workers, said the buyout offer is more generous than what the union contract calls for.
"They went over and above the contract," he said. "They are looking to get volunteers."
The buyout offer was presented to employees Thursday by Newsday publisher Debby Krenek and editor Deborah Henley. It follows involuntary buyouts last year for pressmen, truck drivers and collators.
That round of buyouts was tied to The New York Times' starting to print Newsday, amNewYork and other papers at its plant in College Point, Queens. Some of the affected Newsday employees were hired by the Times.

Leonard Pitts: Honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug

Autor: Pitts, Leonard.

Texto completo: You had to become an "honorary white."
That was the status South Africa used to bestow upon black performers from the United States who visited the apartheid regime. The O'Jays, Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Eartha Kitt were among those who received that designation, allowing them access to hotels and restaurants from which black Africans were barred.
It was, as you might expect, a controversial thing. Or as Eddie Levert of the O'Jays later observed, "We've been apologizing ever since."
While there is no official "honorary white" status in this country, American politics has evolved a rough analog. As lily-white conservatism has lurched deeper into a brazen racism and xenophobia reminiscent of the 1950s, black and brown people willing to use their color to give it moral cover have seen themselves eagerly embraced by those whose sins they abet.
It's not quite access to "whites only" hotels and restaurants, but it is acceptance into white spaces otherwise closed and hostile to people like you. Sometimes, it even brings a kind of petty stardom in the murky world of right-wing bloggers, social media and cable news. Racist xenophobes get to feel that they're not racist or xenophobic at all because, hey, "Diamond and Silk" agree with them.
But ultimately, the joke is always on you. In recent days, we've seen that lesson learned painfully and publicly by two men: a black Donald Trump voter named Kevin Martin and a Donald Trump friend of Puerto Rican heritage named Geraldo Rivera.
The former told CNN last week that when Trump told four congresswomen of color to "go back" to their countries, it "just came out of left field" and "hit a lot of us in the gut." The latter, while loyally insisting Trump has "been treated unfairly," conceded to The New York Times that, "As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible."
To which, the only appropriate response is: Wow. Just ... wow.
After the housing discrimination suits, the quote about black laziness, the persecution of the Central Park Five, now it's suddenly "impossible" for Rivera to deny Trump's bigotry? After the Mexican rapists crack, the smear against a Mexican-American judge, the Muslim ban, the "very fine people on both sides," Martin thinks Trump's latest rancid spew "came out of left field?!"
One can only conclude that honorary whiteness must be one powerful drug. Side effects include cultural amnesia and inability to process reality.
It's not that people of color can't or shouldn't be conservative, as that term was once understood. But this modern iteration doesn't care about small government or muscular diplomacy. Rather, it is working to normalize racism and enshrine xenophobia, and if you're black or brown and still don't realize that, well, again, wow.
The thing is, honorary whiteness has its limitations. Consider Barry Martin, an honorary white black dancer who toured South Africa in 1983 and was in a single-car accident while there. An ambulance picked up the white driver, but left Martin in the wreckage. A black motorist happened by and took him to a white hospital where he was refused admission. Eventually, Martin wound up in the black section of another hospital.
Somewhere in all that jostling, his injured spine was severed. Martin became a quadriplegic. He never walked, much less danced, again.
Take his story as an object lesson, you honorary whites of American politics: You are not special, only useful.
You'd be wise to learn the difference.

Texto completo: Uma Thurman has carved out a three-decade career in Hollywood by combining go-for-broke fierceness with preternatural poise and a formidable intellect. The actress, who was born in Boston and grew up in Amherst, has been known as the sultry femme fatale in “Pulp Fiction," an indie queen who rejected easy-money blockbusters in order to play complex roles in films like “Henry & June" and “Hysterical Blindness," and the butt-kicking, sword-wielding star of Quentin Tarantino's “Kill Bill" diptych.
But as an over-40 actress in Hollywood, Thurman has also faced the prospect of dwindling roles worthy of her talent. So she began to look elsewhere for meaty characters. Two years ago, that led her to take on a different challenge — headlining a new play on Broadway, “The Parisian Woman," written by Beau Willimon, creator of the American version of “House of Cards." It was her first stage role in nearly 20 years.
In a phone interview, Thurman, 49, says the psychic pressure of doing live theater and carrying a new play with your name on the marquee was especially difficult — especially when said play is greeted with middling reviews.
“Getting through the full-length run of a Broadway show is Herculean. It was like an initiation-by-fire," Thurman says, while driving back from rehearsal at Tanglewood, where she appeared last week as the narrator in the world premiere of “Penelope," by the late composer Andre Previn, with text by Tom Stoppard. “It's difficult, the whole sort of brutality of 'is Broadway going to accept you or repel you?' You know, if you can make it on Broadway, you can make it anywhere. It could break a human being, especially doing it for the first time.
“But it was also a great experience in a lot of ways, and I'm very glad that I did it," says the actress.
Despite the bumpy ride, Thurman remains undaunted, and she's heading back to the stage again, this time in the nurturing confines of the Williamstown Theatre Festival in the Berkshires, not far from her “old stomping grounds," playing the widowed Mrs. Alving in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's late 19th-century drama “Ghosts." The play, directed by Carey Perloff in a translation by Paul Walsh, runs July 31 through Aug. 18.
The project came about when Thurman and Williamstown artistic director Mandy Greenfield hit it off after meeting through a mutual friend. They began discussing potential projects, and Greenfield would send her new plays to read. But nothing stuck. Then Greenfield asked how she felt about Ibsen and “Ghosts," and Thurman's ears immediately perked up.
“Ibsen's work, having studied it in high school a bit, was one of the things that drew me to want to be an actress," she says. “Ibsen's women are so fascinating and deep and complicated and truly require every scrap of talent one has to get through them."
When “Ghosts" premiered in 1882, it was greeted with scorn and disgust, denounced because of its candid discussions of marital infidelity, sexuality, venereal disease, euthanasia, and the liberation of women. Moreover, Ibsen had offered a scathing indictment of Norwegian society's oppressive social strictures and its moral decay to protect those social norms.
Set in a country house, the play centers on the widowed Mrs. Alving, who is trying to free herself from the ghosts of her past. Despite her husband's philandering, she had sought to preserve the troubled marriage and prevent scandal from tainting her family. She had even sent away her son, Oswald, to boarding school when he was young in order to protect him from the reality of his father's debauched life.
As the play begins, Mrs. Alving is preparing to open an orphanage she's built in her deceased husband's name. Oswald, now grown, has returned home after years living abroad and fashioning a life as a bohemian artist, but he has a couple of troubling secrets to share with his mother. Meanwhile, Pastor Manders, who was Mrs. Alving's paramour many years earlier before he forced her to return to her husband, is overseeing the construction of the orphanage.
Director Perloff points out that Ibsen created Mrs. Alving as a response to the scandal provoked by “A Doll's House" two years before. At the end of that play, Nora Helmer famously walks out on her family and her oppressive marriage.
“To some extent, Mrs. Alving is the answer to Nora, because Mrs. Alving tried to leave her home and leave her husband, but was forced back again," Thurman says. “So Mrs. Alving is the result of a failed attempt to escape an abusive and destructive household."
Since her husband's death, Mrs. Alving has had an awakening. She's yearning for independence and rejects the opinions, customs, and social mores of the time. “She's a character who's in a sort of spiritual crisis," Thurman says. “She's doubting the teachings of the church and questioning all of the conventions of society — that a wife has a duty to stay with her husband no matter what. So she's rejecting society in some way and is being treated [by the Pastor] as if she's falling out of line with social norms. That must have been quite threatening at the time."
Perloff says “Ghosts" also examines the “ferocious attachment" that a mother feels for her son, but also “tragically how little she really knows him."
“In one sense, she made this ultimate sacrifice to save him, but in another sense she abandoned him. It's so complex," Thurman says. “That relationship is one of the things that's so relevant and eternal about the play."
Indeed, Perloff says, “Uma understands the complexity of what it means to be a mother. She has three children who she"s passionate about. When we started talking, I knew right away this was not going to be an abstract struggle to her."
He says “Ghosts" examines the friction between holding onto our ideals and beliefs versus telling the truth. “Ibsen was really probing that conflict — the danger of telling the truth coupled with the necessity of telling the truth."
“How much of the truth is healthy for a person and how many secrets can someone live with without being sickened by them?" Thurman says. “These things are things that I think everybody struggles with."
Indeed, in early 2018 the actress told her own very dark truth, in a revelatory New York Times interview, about being sexually assaulted by her onetime champion, disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, her anger at his industry enablers, and suffering lasting injuries in a car accident on the set of “Kill Bill" after feeling pressured by Tarantino to perform the stunt herself.
While she acknowledges that letting out the truth was cathartic, she insists she doesn't want anyone to pity her. That Zen outlook can no doubt be traced to her upbringing by a father, Robert Thurman, who's one of the world's foremost Buddhist scholars and a longtime friend of the Dalai Lama.
“I've been extremely fortunate," she says, “and I think I'm probably most fortunate for having the courage to just try to move forward, try to take another step, and try not to let things overcome me — to be brave."

Texto completo: The Arlington Heights Memorial Library celebrated FanCon’s fourth year as more than 800 residents of all ages stopped by the annual comic book and pop culture convention Saturday, June 13.
Fans were dressed up in all sorts of fun costumes as they made their way throughout the library, participating in more than 20 different activities. From an intense Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Tournament hosted by The Age of the Geeks that had 78 participants to fan-themed crafts, there was something for everyone at this year’s FanCon.
New York Times best-selling author and illustrator Jarrett J. Krosoczka, who is known for the popular Lunch Lady and Jedi Academy book series and his recent graphic memoir, "Hey, Kiddo," was one of the biggest highlights of the day as he met fans while hosting an illustrator’s workshop, two book signings and an author talk.
"The best part of FanCon is having the author here," said Tania Fraser, who attended FanCon with her 10-year-old son, Scot. "My son just came out of the illustrator’s workshop and he drew characters from his books. I think it’s great that the library does this."
Other popular activities included Nerd Trivia, which tested people’s pop culture knowledge in a game show-style format; an appearance from the characters of "Alice in Wonderland," who hosted a Mad Tea Party and a photo op session; a Create Your Spidersona: Drawing Workshop and Artist’s Alley, which gave convention-goers the opportunity to meet nine different artists and exhibitors.
"I think it’s very entertaining to see (everyone) having fun. With all the different costumes, it’s a different environment for the boys," said Joseph Urizar Sr., who attended FanCon with his mother and two sons.
"My mom noticed that it’s the diversity that sticks out. It’s a welcoming environment for all."

Texto completo: On Wednesday, former special counsel Robert Mueller testified before two House committees on his report of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.
The Mueller movie's final cut
By Richard Cherwitz
For weeks the news media and political pundits have asked: Will the movie be better than the book? We now have an answer: It depends on which version of Wednesday’s testimony by former special counsel Robert Mueller before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees the public viewed.
Admittedly, the rhetorical expectations set for Mueller were unreasonably high; he has never been a dynamic speaker, and at the age of 74 he is far from a physically animated performer. For whatever reason, he was a reluctant witness. Moreover, it would be difficult for any circumspect person to remember the details of a 448-page nuanced report prepared by a large staff — let alone to succeed in bringing the report to life.
The impact of the highlight reel
Nevertheless, as someone who has spent his 40-plus year career studying and teaching political communication, I believe the rhetorical difference between viewing the entire Mueller hearing versus watching the short highlights reel assembled later in the day by nearly all media venues was profound. The former was tedious, frustrating and certainly not compelling. The latter was surprisingly revealing and extremely potent.
What is clear now is that if Democrats wish the public to pay attention to Mueller’s report, which is required to move the needle on the question of impeachment and influence the outcome of the 2020 election, they should put together a 30- or 60-second video of his most pointed and forceful statements from Wednesday.
After all, it has become increasingly clear that most Americans no longer get their news from the print media. Moreover, in the era of President Donald Trump, the facts don’t speak for themselves. What transpired Wednesday, therefore, reminds us about the enormous rhetorical challenge faced by both political parties: How most convincingly can a message be framed visually?
Alan M. Dershowitz: Mueller testimony was confusing and contradictory
Politicians as marketers
Republicans have done a better job of meeting this challenge. No doubt this at least in part is due to the fact that Trump, as a longtime marketer, as well as his supporters, always seem to be one step ahead of the game, preempting and constraining potential messages of the opposition. Democratic messages appear scattered, uncoordinated and thus less effective.
The potential impact of this rhetorical state of affairs is frightening. Perhaps for one of the first times in our country’s history, the truth and the facts could permanently be undermined and subverted by message sophistication and strategy. And that should be worrisome to all of us who care about democratic deliberation, regardless of our political ideology and affiliation.
Richard Cherwitz is a professor of communication at the University of Texas at Austin.
What others are saying
President Donald Trump, Twitter: "The Democrats lost so big today. Their party is in shambles right now. They've got the 'Squad' leading their party. They are a mess. "
Noah Bookbinder, The New York Times: "The American people deserve a process that will facilitate a thorough assessment of the evidence presented and the gravity of the president’s misconduct. Far from being a distraction from Congress’ other responsibilities, checking abuses of executive powers is one of its core functions. Trump has spent his entire presidency trying to foreclose the possibility of accountability for his misdeeds. Robert Mueller, in his testimony on Wednesday, made clear that such a path is unacceptable. Congress must take it from here. "
Michael Brendan Dougherty, National Review: "Aggression is not the natural language of our political class. Our politicians call for regime change, as if war were a matter of switching office holders. Trump threatened countries with fire, fury and annihilation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , said this week 'my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching' Trump. And in that completely bizarre, and entirely noncredible threat, is the Democrats’ problem heading into 2020. They sometimes feel like fighting. But I suspect they never will. "
Tom Nichols, USA TODAY: "The Republicans once prided themselves on being the toughest opponents of America’s enemies. They have now been reduced to inane babbling about conspiracy theories, excusing the Russians, whitewashing the hostile foreign intelligence service called WikiLeaks, and attacking a man of indisputable honor and probity — a fellow Republican, no less — all in the name of covering Donald Trump’s tracks. . . . After the Mueller hearings, I have never been prouder to be an ex-Republican. Mueller’s appearance in Congress was a day of shame for the GOP, and it is preview of the tactics we can expect from the former party of national security should its leader ever be called to account before the American people. "
What readers are saying
Mueller was pathetic, and his partisan "investigation" was exposed to its fullest. He could not answer any question; it looked like he wasn't even aware that the hearing was about his investigation.
— Valera Goetz
We are innocent until proven guilty in this country, yet the Democratic Party thinks Trump is guilty until proven innocent.
— Dennis Tucker
Thank you, Robert Mueller. It was a nice contrast to hear an honest and patriotic American like you speak in Trump's Washington.
— Jeannie Presler
That "witch hunt" sure did nab a lot of witches.

Texto completo: Taliban may release hostages: WASHINGTON — Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan says militants may soon release two Western hostages as negotiations on a peace deal for Afghanistan make progress with his country’s help. Khan, who was in the middle of a three-day U.S. visit Tuesday, has repeatedly said the men, an American and Australian, could be freed from the Taliban-linked militants who have held them for nearly three years.
Compromise on drug costs bill: WASHINGTON — Two senior senators — a Republican and a Democrat — unveiled compromise legislation Tuesday to reduce prescription drug costs for millions of Medicare recipients, while saving money for federal and state health care programs serving seniors and low-income people. Iowa Republican Charles Grassley and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden said the bill would for the first time limit drug copays for people with Medicare’s "Part D" prescription plan , by capping patients’ out-of-pocket costs at $3,100 a year starting in 2022.
Trump threatens Guatemala: WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened retribution against Guatemala over immigration after the country’s high court blocked its government from signing an asylum deal with the United States. Trump tweeted that Guatemala has decided against signing a "safe-third agreement" requiring Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to instead apply for those protections in Guatemala, even though the country’s government never said it had agreed to the arrangement.
U.S. says it ‘engaged’ 2 drones: WASHINGTON — The U.S. military says that when it destroyed an Iranian drone last week over the Strait of Hormuz, it also took aim at a second drone. U.S. Central Command says that one Iranian drone crashed into the sea after the USS Boxer took what Central Command called "defensive action" against it last Thursday. It said the Boxer also "engaged" a second Iranian drone at the same time, but could not confirm it was destroyed.
Sticky situation in New Orleans: NEW ORLEANS — Crews spent the night cleaning syrup from one block of a four-lane street along New Orleans’ French Quarter. Police say a container truck spilled about 1,000 gallons of syrup Monday evening after a rubber shipping bladder broke.
Trump sues over state taxes: President Donald Trump sued to block the Democrat-led U.S. House Ways and Means Committee from obtaining his tax records from New York state, in the latest attempt to keep his personal financial information out of public view. In the lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Washington federal court, Trump is attempting to fend off committee chairman Richard Neal's potential request for the documents under New York’s TRUST Act, which compels the state’s tax department to comply with the House committee’s records requests.
Armstrong death saw payout: CINCINNATI — An Ohio hospital paid the estate of astronaut Neil Armstrong $6 million in a confidential agreement to settle allegations that post-surgical complications led to Armstrong’s 2012 death, according to court documents and a report in the New York Times. The 2014 settlement went to 10 family members, including Armstrong’s two sons, sister, brother and six grandchildren, according to documents filed with the Hamilton County Probate Court in Cincinnati. Armstrong’s widow, Carol, did not receive any money.

Texto completo: La agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) mantiene una campaña en Twitter donde destaca el trabajo de sus oficiales para detener a inmigrantes indocumentados y procesar su deportación.
“Las operaciones que realizan nuestros oficiales de ICE proveen una vital seguridad pública que beneficia a las comunidades al mantener a extranjeros fuera de las calles” , destacó en un video Marc Moore , director la oficina de campo de ERO Dallas.
ERO es la división de ICE que procesa las deportaciones con órdenes por un juez.
El operativo al que se refiere la agencia ocurrió en el norte de Texas, donde se detuvieron a 75 extranjeros “criminales y fugitivos de inmigración”, señala el Gobierno.

La agencia ha publicó otro video sobre un operativo en San Francisco, California, que permitió la detención de 42 personas .
No quedan claras las fechas de esas movilizaciones, pero el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence , confirmó a The New York Times que entre el 14 de mayo y el 11 de julio hubo un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , donde se capturó a de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses.
Ese periodo fue antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump en 10 ciudades, donde solamente se capturó a 35 personas, según el propio Albence, quien afirmó que esa movilización se complicó debido a los informes de medios y a las alertas de activistas.

Texto completo: La agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) mantiene una campaña en Twitter donde destaca el trabajo de sus oficiales para detener a inmigrantes indocumentados y procesar su deportación.
“Las operaciones que realizan nuestros oficiales de ICE proveen una vital seguridad pública que beneficia a las comunidades al mantener a extranjeros fuera de las calles” , destacó en un video Marc Moore , director la oficina de campo de ERO Dallas.
ERO es la división de ICE que procesa las deportaciones con órdenes por un juez.
El operativo al que se refiere la agencia ocurrió en el norte de Texas, donde se detuvieron a 75 extranjeros “criminales y fugitivos de inmigración”, señala el Gobierno.

La agencia ha publicó otro video sobre un operativo en San Francisco, California, que permitió la detención de 42 personas .
No quedan claras las fechas de esas movilizaciones, pero el director interino de la agencia Matt Albence , confirmó a The New York Times que entre el 14 de mayo y el 11 de julio hubo un operativo llamado “Cross Check” (“Verificación Cruzada”) , donde se capturó a de 899 inmigrantes en dos meses.
Ese periodo fue antes de las llamadas “grandes redadas” anunciadas por el presidente Donald Trump en 10 ciudades, donde solamente se capturó a 35 personas, según el propio Albence, quien afirmó que esa movilización se complicó debido a los informes de medios y a las alertas de activistas.

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13 .
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estas jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban, señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

Texto completo: Millions of people who were exposed to identity theft when Equifax failed to protect their Social Security numbers and other data finally can make the company pay for it.
I encourage you to get all you can.
Settlements announced Monday with state and federal authorities require the credit bureau to cough up as much as $425 million to consumers and pay fines totaling $275 million.
Not all of the 147 million people whose personal information was exposed in the 2017 breach are automatically eligible for restitution. To collect, you must prove you lost money.
But a lot of people should qualify because eligible losses include fees paid to other credit bureaus to freeze your credit to protect yourself after Equifax's sloppiness.
"The consumer fund of up to $425 million that we are announcing today reinforces our commitment to putting consumers first and safeguarding their data - and reflects the seriousness with which we take this matter," Equifax CEO Mark Begor said in a statement Monday.
Too bad the company wasn't so committed to data security two years ago.
Whoever stole the data - that's still a mystery - got into Equifax's system through a software vulnerability the company didn't fix despite being warned by federal cybersecurity officials that it was a problem.
Hackers accessed data through that hole and weren't detected for more than two months.
The resulting breach was one of the largest in U.S. history. Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, driver's license numbers and credit card numbers were exposed. Nearly half of the U.S. population was affected, including an estimated 5.4 million Pennsylvanians, representing 75% of the state's adult population. The state will receive $7.3 million in fine money.
Panicked consumers froze their credit with all three major credit bureaus, often at a cost because laws in many states, including Pennsylvania, allowed fees to be charged for that service.
Congress passed a law last year making credit freezes free. But that didn't help those who already paid. Monday's settlements will.
The settlements with the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 48 state attorneys general including Pennsylvania's are pending court approval.
They call for Equifax to pay $300 million into a compensation fund to pay breach victims. If that is not enough to cover claims, an additional $125 million will be paid.
Consumers can request restitution, up to $20,000, for:
*$25/hour for up to 20 hours of time spent protecting personal information or addressing identity theft.
*Purchasing credit monitoring or identity theft protection.
*Freezing or unfreezing credit reports at any credit bureau. This is where much of the settlement could be paid. I wrote last year that about 1 of 5 Americans froze their credit, at a collective cost of $1.4 billion, after the Equifax breach, according to a survey commissioned by Fundera, a small business lender.
*Reimbursement for up to 25% of the amount paid to Equifax for credit or identity monitoring between Sept. 7, 2016, and Sept. 7, 2017.
*Unreimbursed costs, expenses, losses or charges stemming from identity theft. You don't have to prove a direct connection between the theft and the Equifax breach, only that the theft occurred after the breach, according to The New York Times.
*Miscellaneous expenses such as notary, fax, postage, mileage and telephone charges.
Claims cannot be filed yet. Deadlines will be set after court approval. Some claims will be accepted for up to four years, according to settlement documents.
Equifax has been providing free credit monitoring since the breach. It will provide at least another 10 years of free monitoring to those who sign up. People who want to pay for credit monitoring elsewhere can seek up to $125 in reimbursement. All breach victims will be eligible for at least seven years of free identity-restoration services.
Starting in January, all U.S. consumers can obtain six additional free credit reports, in addition to the one free annual report already allotted each year from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The additional six reports will be available for seven years.
To obtain cash restitution or accept Equifax's offer of free credit monitoring, you have to file a claim. After court approval of the settlements, claims can be filed at equifaxbreachsettlement.com. Information also can be obtained from Equifax's claims administrator at 833-759-2982.
The Federal Trade Commission has a good summary of the settlement at ftc.gov/equifax. You can sign up there to receive email alerts about the claims process.
Keep in mind the settlements aren't the end of the data breach scandal. The stolen information could be used by identity thieves indefinitely. Don't assume you're safe just because you haven't been victimized yet. Stay vigilant.
That's a shortcoming of the settlements, that claims won't be accepted indefinitely. The company has the resources to pay more.
While $700 million in fines and restitution, plus about another $80 million in legal fees, is a lot, The New York Times reported Monday that the total price tag is a bit less than one typical quarter of sales for the company.
That's not much of a penalty.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
THE GREAT HACK (2019) Stream on Netflix. In her 2013 documentary, "The Square," the director Jehane Noujaim captured Egypt from the winter of 2011 to the summer of 2013, during a time of political unrest and revolution lubricated by social media. The results of Noujaim's work, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, were "stunning." This new documentary, made by Noujaim and the filmmaker Karim Amer, is more directly concerned with social networks: It turns its attention to the commodification of personal data, with a focus on the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the way American Facebook users' data was harvested in the lead-up to the 2016 election. The principal figure through which that story gets dissected is Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica executive who became an outspoken defector. Also interviewed are the whistle-blower Christopher Wylie and the journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who was an author of a collaborative report between The Times and The Observer that exposed how Cambridge Analytica harvested the information of tens of millions of Facebook users. In that article, Wylie described the company as an "arsenal of weapons" in a culture war. This documentary picks apart those weapons, and their effects.
SERENITY (2019) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. When Anne Hathaway's character steps into the only bar on the lonely Plymouth Island, the setting of this thriller from Steven Knight, she's not there for a shandy. She's there to offer her heavy-drinking fishing boat captain ex (Matthew McConaughey) $ 10 million to toss her violent new husband (Jason Clarke) into the sea. What follows is a mysterious, noirish story of tropical tuna and potential murder. "One of my favorite things about 'Serenity' was how provoked I felt by it both in my mind and in the pit of my stomach" Hathaway told The Times in January. For many critics, though, the film provoked a less visceral response. "For reasons known only to Knight, 'Serenity' couldn't just be a film noir," Wesley Morris wrote in his review. "He's laid some kind of science-fiction nonsense atop it because, apparently, the movie needed a ply of trashy pretension to echo Adrian Lyne's thriller 'Jacob's Ladder' and complement the luxe incoherence of McConaughey's Lincoln ads."
What's on TV
BLADE: TRINITY (2004) 5:30 p.m. on Syfy. Mahershala Ali might have just been announced as the star of a new version of Blade, but for now Wesley Snipes is still the human face of this comic-based series. He stars here as the titular martial-arts-toting vampire hunter, in what proved to be the conclusion of a trilogy. The previous two installments will air on Syfy directly before, at 12:30 p.m. and 3 p.m.
ANCIENT SKIES 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This three-part documentary series explores the evolution of humans' relationship with the celestial. The first episode, "Gods and Monsters," looks at the way the night sky informed religions.

Texto completo: SAN ANTONIO -- Francisco Erwin Galicia, 18, was born in Dallas and, according to his birth certificate, is an American citizen. But he was held in federal immigration custody for nearly four weeks after he was detained at a Border Patrol traffic checkpoint in South Texas.
Mr. Galicia showed the agents the proof of his birth in the United States when he was stopped at the checkpoint one night in June, when he was on his way to a college soccer tryout. But the agents, his lawyer said, told him they believed it was fake.
They took him into custody, taking him first to a Border Patrol facility in the border city of McAllen and then to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Pearsall, Tex., southwest of San Antonio.
Late Tuesday afternoon, 26 days after he was first detained, Mr. Galicia was released after the news media, Democratic lawmakers and migrant advocacy groups put his case in the national spotlight.
"He's really happy to be out," Mr. Galicia's lawyer, Claudia Ivett Galan, said in a telephone interview from a restaurant near the detention center where she and her client had gone for tacos.
Mr. Galicia declined to comment. "He's feeling a little bit overwhelmed," Ms. Galan said.
Mr. Galicia's case, first reported by The Dallas Morning News, appears to be part of stepped-up enforcement efforts at Border Patrol traffic checkpoints as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal entry at the southern border. In cases such as these, the administration's zero-tolerance approach sometimes collides with the messy, unorthodox lives of mixed-status families, whose paperwork is often legitimate but incomplete or faulty.
Officials with the Border Patrol's parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, and with Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on Tuesday that they had no immediate comment but were looking into the case.
Mr. Galicia was traveling north on the evening of June 27 with his younger brother and a group of friends. They were headed to a soccer tryout at a college in Texas. Mr. Galicia will be a senior in the fall at Johnny Economedes High School in his hometown, Edinburg, a border city in the Rio Grande Valley. He was hoping that his soccer skills would capture the attention of the coaches and scouts, and earn him a scholarship.
To drive north from Edinburg, the group knew they had to pass a Border Patrol checkpoint about 60 miles north of the border near the town of Falfurrias, Tex. The checkpoints form a secondary layer of border security, far from the actual fence line: All cars must stop, and agents typically ask the occupants of each vehicle if they are United States citizens. The more than 30 permanent checkpoints across Arizona, California, Texas and New Mexico have instilled a quiet, widespread fear among many Hispanic citizens and legal residents in border cities that they will be mistaken for someone who is without papers.
Mr. Galicia had traveled through the Falfurrias checkpoint in the past and was not expecting any trouble, Ms. Galan said. Nevertheless, as many Hispanics do, he had brought with him numerous documents, including a birth certificate that showed he was born at a hospital in Dallas on Dec. 24, 2000; his state ID, issued in January by the Texas Department of Public Safety; and his Social Security card. Ms. Galan supplied The New York Times with copies of these documents; the birth certificate features stamps from both the State of Texas and the City of Dallas Bureau of Vital Statistics.
Mr. Galicia does not have a driver's license, Ms. Galan said.
"Border Patrol agents were telling Francisco that his birth certificate was fake, that he was Mexican," she said.
One of the issues that may have aroused the agents' suspicions was the presence of Mr. Galicia's younger brother, Marlon Galicia, 17, who was born in Mexico and has been living in the United States illegally. He had only a school ID, Ms. Galan said. The driver of the vehicle, one of Mr. Galicia's classmates, is also a United States citizen, Ms. Galan said.
Another issue that could have confused the agents and has complicated his case involved one of Mr. Galicia's documents. He brought with him a tourist visa issued by Mexico that stated that he had been born in that country, his lawyer said.
Mr. Galicia's mother, Sanjuana Galicia Chapa, is an undocumented Mexican immigrant who lives in Edinburg. When Mr. Galicia was born, she did not put her real name on his birth certificate because of her immigration status, and she never corrected it. Because of that, she never went through the process of getting her son a United States passport. She believed the best way for him to travel back and forth from Texas to Mexico was to get him the Mexican tourist visa, Ms. Galan said.
"She never fixed that name on his birth certificate, so she never got him a passport and thought it was just easier to get him a tourist visa to get him in and out of the country," Ms. Galan said.
Marlon Galicia was also briefly detained but later signed documents agreeing to effectively self-deport, and is now living with relatives in Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from McAllen.
Mr. Galicia's mother tried on her own to get her son released. After about two weeks with no success, she turned to Ms. Galan for help. Ms. Galicia said in an interview that after her son was detained, the authorities prevented him from communicating with any relatives for weeks. She spoke to him for the first time since his detention only on Saturday.
"Almost a month of not knowing anything about my son," she said, adding: "I also feel mad because he did not commit any crime. He spends all his time studying and playing sports."
At about 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Galicia was waiting in the lobby at the ICE detention center when Ms. Galan arrived for a meeting to discuss her client's case with officials. She said none of the ICE officials gave her any explanation about his detainment after he was released.
"I did talk to his officer, and he did not apologize," Ms. Galan said. "All he said was just, 'Thank you for your patience."'

Texto completo: The Forward, a 122-year-old Jewish publication, named a new leader of its newsroom on Tuesday, appointing Jodi Rudoren, a veteran editor and reporter at The New York Times, as editor in chief.
In hiring Ms. Rudoren, a former Jerusalem bureau chief for The Times, The Forward is taking another step past a tumultuous period. After moving from a weekly to a monthly schedule, the publication ceased its print edition this past spring. It also cut nearly 30 percent of its staff, including the previous editor in chief, Jane Eisner.
Last week, the publisher and chief executive, Rachel Fishman Feddersen, announced the receipt of a $ 500,000 gift from Craig Newmark, the Craigslist founder and media philanthropist. Ms. Feddersen said the money would be used to revitalize The Forward's website and expand its readership.
Ms. Rudoren, who joined The Times in 1998, is an associate managing editor at the paper, developing strategies to better engage readers. She is expected to start her new job in September.
One of the highest-ranking female journalists at The Times, Ms. Rudoren anchored the paper's coverage of Israel from 2012 to 2015. Her other roles have included Chicago bureau chief, correspondent on the 2004 presidential campaign, and deputy editor on the Metro desk, where she created the Sunday Metropolitan section.
"We're excited to bring in Jodi's depth of experience with digital invention and the caliber of her journalism," Ms. Feddersen said in an interview. "For our staff to have a leader like Jodi is inspirational."
The Forward, which began as a Yiddish-language daily newspaper at the turn of the 20th century, focuses its coverage on Jewish life, including politics, religion, culture and foreign affairs. It started publishing English-language editions in the 1980s. (The publication produces articles in both languages online.)
The Forward reaches about two million readers a month online, Ms. Feddersen said; a third of the audience is under 35. The publication is overseen by a nonprofit group, the Forward Association. In January, Ms. Feddersen said The Forward had lost money for decades, with the losses numbering "in the millions" in recent years.
Ms. Rudoren, in an interview, said that she was a longtime reader of The Forward, dating to her days as a history major at Yale, where she researched microfiche editions from the 1920s. She praised the paper's "pillar of investigative journalism, of provocative op-eds, and of really great cultural coverage."
"The Forward needs to continue that tradition, push into more digital distribution and storytelling areas, and redefine itself as the platform for the American Jewish conversation," she said.
At The Times, Ms. Rudoren was an author of the so-called 2020 report, a major review of the paper's digital efforts. She was also an executive producer of a digital series called "One in 8 Million," which received an Emmy Award in 2009.
The announcement of Ms. Rudoren's departure from The Times comes four months after another high-ranking female editor, Susan Chira, left to become the editor in chief of The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization focused on criminal justice issues.
Ms. Rudoren previously wrote for The Times under the byline Jodi Wilgoren. She and her husband, the former Gary Ruderman, who married in 2004, merged their surnames in 2006.

Jungle’s ‘Stinkers’ is funny and poignant; Sting is coming to the Ordway

Texto completo: If you go to “Stinkers,” the new play at the Jungle, take a moment or two during the first act to close your eyes and just listen. Hear what the actors on stage are saying, but pay special attention to the laughter from the audience. There’s a lot of laughter, especially in the first scene. Josh Tobiessen has written a very funny play.
Conceived as a vehicle for Sally Wingert, who has not performed at the Jungle for 15 years, “Stinkers” takes place at a home on a lake in northern Minnesota. Wingert is Joyce, mother of Brad (John Catron). He’s a loving and attentive stay-at-home dad to two kids, 3-year-Oscar and almost-2 Evie. Calvin (Nate Cheeseman) is Brad’s unemployed neighbor and friend. Joyce has a friend named Lilith (George Keller). The kids have a mom – her name is Allison – but she’s away at a conference.
Oscar and Evie are life-size puppets, manipulated by Reed Sigmund, a longtime member of the Children’s Theatre acting company, and Megan Burns, who’s becoming a Jungle regular. In the script, Tobiessen notes that “the actors operating the puppets … should make no attempt to hide or blend into the background.” Handled skillfully, as they are here, puppets are their own kind of magic. They and their people become one. In “Stinkers,” they even look alike. Oscar and Sigmund wear the same color shirt. Evie and Burns have the same hair, complete with bows.
All the action takes place on Chelsea M. Warren’s amazing set, the home’s interior, with tall windows that make you believe you’re in northern Minnesota. It’s loaded with details: toys spilling out of a bookcase onto the floor, a paper towel roll and a knife block on the kitchen counter, kids’ drawings stuck to the fridge with magnets. A sliding glass door leads to a patio with a grill. A wasps’ nest hangs just outside; you won’t notice it right away, but it figures later in the play, and what’s fun is whenever the door opens, you hear a buzz, thanks to Sean Healey’s sound design.
As the play opens, Brad has put the kids down for a nap when Calvin comes in through the sliding glass door without knocking, something you know he’s done before. We quickly learn that Calvin is well-meaning but shallow, on the hustle and a little too invested in Instagram, vision boards and self-help books (not the actual books, just descriptions he’s read online).
Calvin’s noise wakes the kids and soon they’re on stage, bringing the energy, demands, unpredictability and outbursts of toddlers. Not to mention the almost constant pottying needs. Much of the play is a kind of mayhem, with conversations crossing and the kids being kids.
Brad is in the middle of a diaper change when there’s a knock at the main door. It’s his mom, Joyce (Wingert), fresh out of jail for white-collar crimes. (“It was taxes,” she tells nosy Calvin. “A little more than taxes,” says Brad.) Waiting in the car, but not for long, is tattooed and menacing Lilith (Keller). Later, she’ll show the kids how to turn a toothbrush into a shiv.
With Joyce and Lilith in the mix, “Stinkers” picks up speed. We hate to spoil surprises, so we’ll just say that Brad is trying to start a small business and bring in extra cash. He’s written a children’s story about a pickup truck that gets the hiccups. He’s making small wooden “hiccup trucks” to sell on Etsy. Joyce jumps in and offers to help by selling them at a local farmers’ market. She’ll need his bank card and number to deposit his earnings.
You won’t need a self-help book to realize Joyce is up to no good. (At mention of Brad’s bank card, the audience made little uh-oh sounds.) Joyce also talks Calvin into buying a new truck he can’t afford. That it, too, becomes a sort of hiccup truck is one of the many delights of the play.
“Stinkers” is silly, but it’s not all silly. There are moments when old hurts surface between Brad and Joyce. Poignant family stuff. It’s not as deep or as layered as “Lone Star Spirits,” the Tobiessen play the Jungle produced in 2017. (Which, btw, also featured Catron and Cheeseman.) But it doesn’t have to be. It’s great to see Wingert on the Jungle’s stage, commanding in a role written especially for her. At 90 minutes with no intermission, “Stinkers” is right-sized for a summer entertainment.
Directed by the Jungle’s Artistic Director Sarah Rasmussen – she and Tobiessen are wife and husband – “Stinkers” continues through Aug. 18. FMI and tickets ($35-50).
Sting and ‘The Last Ship’ coming to the Ordway
Yes, that Sting. Born Gordon Sumner, famous for his years with the Police and his subsequent solo career. Sting the star, winner of multiple Grammy Awards and Kennedy Center Honors, Commander of the British Empire, et cetera. Usually, to see Sting in person, you buy a ticket to a show in some huge arena somewhere in the world.
On Monday, the Ordway announced that Sting will be here April 8-19, 2020, with “The Last Ship,” his Tony-nominated Broadway musical. Set in a shipyard, it’s a tale of British industrial decline that has drawn comparisons to “Billy Elliott” and “The Full Monty.” Themes include homecoming and the importance of family and community. All the music is by Sting, and Sting will perform the role of shipyard foreman Jackie White in all the shows.
For his first musical, Sting drew inspiration from an earlier album, “The Soul Cages,” and his own childhood experiences: He grew up near the shipyards of Wallsend.
Rod Kaats, the Ordway’s producing artistic director, said in a statement, “We are thrilled to host Sting and ‘The Last Ship’ on our stage as part of 2019-2020 Broadway at the Ordway. Seeing Sting perform in a semi-autobiographical musical at the intimate Ordway theater will be a once in a lifetime experience.”
Snagging tickets will be a bit like getting them for “Hamilton” at the Orpheum. You can become a 2019-20 Broadway at the Ordway series subscriber. It’s a strong season with six new shows including “Smokey Joe’s Café” and “The Color Purple.” Or you can get tickets for the Ordway’s production of “42nd Street,” starring Tamara Tunie and Jarrod Emick, featuring a powerhouse local cast including Jamecia Bennett, Tyler Michaels King and T. Mychael Rambo. It opens July 23.
Either will give you access to presale tickets for “The Last Ship.” Remaining single tickets will go on sale this fall. Prices start at $75, including fees.
‘Talking Volumes’ to feature Tim O’Brien, Tracy K. Smith
Of the six books covered in this year’s Talking Volumes – the 20th season of a partnership between the Star Tribune and MPR – only one is a novel. Four are nonfiction titles and one is a poetry collection.
For the first time, two Talking Volumes events will take place at the renovated Parkway Theater in Minneapolis. The others will be at the series’ old stomping grounds, the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. (Earlier this year, MPR sold the Fitz to First Avenue.) MPR’s Kerri Miller will host, and the Star Tribune will feature interviews with the authors as lead-ups.
Here’s the schedule:
Sept. 25 at the Fitzgerald: Novelist Alice Hoffman will discuss her latest, “The World That We Knew.” Her earlier novels include “The Dovekeepers” and “The Marriage of Opposites.”
Oct. 9 at the Parkway: Poet Saeed Jones will present his memoir, “How We Fight for Our Lives.”
Oct. 16 at the Parkway: Writer Tim O’Brien , author of “The Things They Carried” and “Going After Cacciato,” winner of the National Book Award, will be here with his memoir, “Dad’s Maybe Book.”
Nov. 7 at the Fitzgerald: Author and commentator Karen Armstrong will present “The Lost Art of Scripture: Rescuing the Sacred Texts.” Armstrong appeared in Talking Volumes 2014 with “Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence.”
Nov. 14 at the Fitzgerald: New York Times columnist Lindy West will discuss “The Witches Are Coming,” her new collection of essays. West is also the author of “Shrill: Notes from a Loud Woman,” which she adapted for a comedy series on Hulu starring SNL’s Aidy Bryant.
Nov. 21 at the Fitzgerald: Poet Tracy K. Smith will be here with her 2018 collection, “Wade in the Water,” published by Graywolf. The Minneapolis press also published her “Life on Mars,” winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Smith is the former U.S. poet laureate.
Tickets are now on sale (as of 10 a.m. today, Tuesday, July 23).

ACE YOUNG AND CLO READY TO ROLL WITH 'ROCK OF AGES'

Texto completo: Back-to-back "Rock of Ages" and "Once" are an unusual one-two of first-timers, with music from the 1980s and 2000s, in Pittsburgh CLO's 73rd summer season.
Before Tony-winning best musical "Once" takes the stage, CLO pumps up the volume for a 1980s jam, with the Tony-nominated hair-band musical "Rock of Ages" opening Tuesday at the Benedum Center, Downtown.
After CLO's fine turns with the lush classic scores of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" and "Peter Pan," it's on to the music of Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake and more.
The jukebox standards are the inspiration for a story about aspiring rocker Drew finding love with sweet Sherrie, and a Sunset Strip club endangered by real estate developers. To save the day, the club owner turns to bad boy rock god Stacee Jaxx, played by "American Idol" alumnus Ace Young.
The singer-songwriter, who appeared on season five of "AI," is no stranger to musicals. He made his Broadway debut as Kenickie in the revival of "Grease" and toured in the '50s rock musical as Danny Zuko. He later took over the role of Berger in the Broadway revival of "Hair," succeeding Will Swenson, and later starred as Joseph in the national tour of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," alongside his wife, Diana DeGarmo, the "Idol" runner-up in season three.
Justin Matthew Sargent reprises his Broadway role as Drew, opposite Carnegie Mellon University grad Tess Soltau as Sherrie, an aspiring actress from Kansas (wink-wink). The cast also includes Broadway veteran Gene Weygandt as club owner Dennis, Chicagoan Nick Druzbanski as narrator Lonny and Dan Peters of Chicago's The West Side Winders as Lead Guitarist. Pittsburgh actor Jeffrey Howell and Nathan Salstone (CMU 2017), seen recently on Broadway in "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child," play Hertz and Franz, the schemers who want to bring down the club.
There are songs aplenty and a mostly tongue-in-cheek story driving "Rock of Ages," which lasted for more than 2,300 performances, from 2009-15, on Broadway.
With another "American Idol" favorite, Constantine Maroulis, as Stacee Jaxx, The New York Times' Charles Isherwood deemed the show to be "a seriously silly, absurdly enjoyable arena-rock musical," and "about as guilty as pleasures get."
"Don't Stop Believing" and "Waiting for a Girl Like You" are among the songs meant to thrill nostalgia buffs, but the song that sums it all up is Starship's "We Built This City."
The 1985 song that declared, "We built this city on rock and roll" topped the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States.
The creators of "Rock of Ages" built this musical on '80s rock and roll, and it keeps on ticking. It's running strong in a long-term off-Broadway engagement at New World Stages, and in Pittsburgh, CLO is ready to rock like it's 1980.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Saying "critics were much more right than I," Fox News correspondent Geraldo Rivera over the weekend distanced himself from President Donald Trump following the president's tweets calling on four Democratic congresswomen of color to "go back" to their countries.
Rivera, a longtime friend of Trump, expressed his misjudgment of the president in remarks published Saturday in a New York Times report. He said that his relationship with Trump "cost me friendships, it has cost me schisms in the family, my wife and I are constantly at odds about the president. "
“I do insist that he’s been treated unfairly. But the unmistakable words, the literal words he said, is an indication that the critics were much more right than I," he told the Times. “As much as I have denied it and averted my eyes from it, this latest incident made it impossible. "

Trump on June 14 criticized four progressive congresswomen of color on Twitter, suggesting that they to "go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. " The congresswomen, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, have rebuked Trump's language, calling him a racist.
All four congresswomen are U. S. citizens and three of them were born in the U. S. . Omar immigrated from Somalia to the United States over 20 years ago and is a naturalized citizen.
The House last week formally condemned Trump's "go back" tweet as racist.

The president, however, has repeatedly doubled down on his statements and denied that his remarks are racist. A "send her back" chant erupted at one of the president's rallies in North Carolina last week when Trump began bashing Omar. Although Trump initially denounced the chant, he later called those attending his rally "patriots. "
He also criticized the four progressive congresswomen, who are colloquially known as "The Squad," in tweets Monday as a "very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. "

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Two Louisiana police officers were fired Monday, just days after one of them wrote in a Facebook post that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a "vile idiot" who should be shot.
Gretna, La. , police officers Charlie Rispoli, who create the post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, were fired, police chief Author Lawson announced in a press conference Monday.
"These officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to the violent act to be conducted against a sitting U. S. congressman, a member of our government, we're not going to tolerate that," Lawson said at the news conference, according to the New York Times. "This incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department. "
Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the department, shared a blog post that falsely claims the New York Democrat said "We pay soldiers too much," according to a screenshot of the post taken by The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate.

"This vile idiot needs a round," Rispoli's wrote in the post. "And I don't mean the kind she used to serve," he added, referring to Ocasio-Cortez's time working as a bartender.
The social media post and resulting firings came amid mounting concern for elected officials' safety in the current political climate.
Ocasio-Cortez, along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, have been the target of President Donald Trump's ire in the past week. He has repeatedly criticized the four progressive Democrats and called on them to "go back" to their countries. All four congresswomen are U. S. citizens, with three being born in the United States.
Trump's comments led leading Democrats on Capitol Hill to inquire about additional security for Omar and other lawmakers.

The New York Democrat just last week questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about threatening messages about her – including Photoshopped images depicting her being rape – in a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents.
At Monday's press conference, Lawson said that both officers who were fired had worked the streets as patrol officers.
However, Lawson said he did not think that Rispoli meant any harm and just got "caught up in the heat of the moment. "

Texto completo: LeROY  Bob and Carol Goodlick estimate that Bob's insulin to keep his diabetes under control cost $7,000 between Jan. 1 and July 1.
Thanks to private insurance and Medicare, they paid $2,000 out of pocket.
"We're lucky enough to be able to do (afford) this," said Bob, a 73-year-old who farms southeast of Downs. "But there would have to be a lot of people who can't afford it."
"I think it's too high," Carol said of the price of insulin. "I know what we pay. There are so many people who aren't fortunate enough to have the insurance we have."
The recent discussion around the Goodlick family's kitchen table in LeRoy is a discussion that is happening around kitchen tables and offices of certified diabetes educators and doctors throughout Central Illinois, in the Illinois General Assembly and in Congress.
"Daily, I'm hearing (from patients) that the cost of managing their diabetes is increasing and not affordable," said Paige Beal, certified diabetes educator (CDE) and registered dietitian (RD) with Advocate BroMenn Medical Center in Normal.
"Last week, I saw a client who stopped taking his insulin because he couldn't afford it after there was a change in his insurance plan," Beal said. "The out-of-pocket cost was too great for him. He ended up in the emergency room because he wasn't taking his insulin."
He was treated and his fortunes improved because he now has different insurance and can afford to take his insulin again, Beal said. But not all patient stories take a positive turn.
Paula Enstrom, a CDE and RN with Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, had a type 1 diabetes patient last year who could no longer afford insulin medicine, stopped taking it and ended up in the emergency room where he received an emergency supply.
"I just had several instances this week" of patients trying to figure out how to afford their insulin, said Ginny Kerwin, CDE and RD at the Joslin Diabetes Center, an affiliate of HSHS Medical Group at HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur.
More than 30 million Americans, or 9.4 percent of the population, have diabetes, a disease in which the body doesn't produce or properly use insulin, a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy needed for daily life.
About one-third of people diagnosed with diabetes eventually are on insulin medicine, CDEs said.
"Everyone with type 1 diabetes (formerly called juvenile diabetes) is on insulin," said Vicke Wakeland, CDE and registered nurse (RN) at Decatur Memorial Hospital in Decatur. "They will die without it."
>
Eventually, many people with type 2 diabetes, which is diagnosed later in life, require insulin. Weight control, physical activity, improving nutrition and other medicines are tried first.
"The topic of cost comes up every single day," said Sherri Schlatter, a CDE and RN at OSF HealthCare Saint James-John W. Albrecht Medical Center in Pontiac.
Nearly 7.5 million Americans rely on insulin but the price tripled from 2002 to 2013, said state Sen. Andy Manar, D-Bunker Hill. Beal said, from 2012 to 2017, the price increased 26 percent.
Manar has sponsored Senate Bill 667, which would cap co-payments for insulin at $100 a month, regardless of how much insulin that person takes.
"In the last 20 years or so, we've seen the price of insulin rise to outlandish levels," Manar said in a statement. "We have a responsibility as lawmakers to help get these prices under control and make this life-saving medication more available to those who need it."
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has introduced a bipartisan bill to speed approvals of lower-cost, generic insulin to help to lower costs.
The three primary insulin manufacturers  Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi  told Congress in the spring that it's not feasible to reduce list prices because drug benefit managers and insurance companies expect discounts and other price concessions that are calculated as part of the list prices, The New York Times reported. They admitted that people with high-deductible health insurance and people who are uninsured don't receive the discounts, the Times reported.
"There definitely are more diagnoses of diabetes and more patients requiring more medications, including insulin, in the past few years," Beal said.
Reasons include improved screening, a more sedentary lifestyle which means more obesity, and an aging population, Enstrom said. "Over time, the body makes less insulin," she said.
"In 2004, 5 percent of the population was diabetic nationally," Enstrom said. Now it's more than 9 percent.
Some patients who can't afford their insulin stretch it out, meaning they may take half of their prescribed doses, CDEs said.
"That puts them at risk of complications of diabetes," Schlatter said. When their blood sugar is high for long periods of time, they are at risk of heart attack, stroke, foot and leg problems that could lead to amputations, vision problems and kidney failure, CDEs said.
"We help them to make it work," Schlatter said.
For example, some patients ask their doctors whether they can be prescribed an older, cheaper insulin medicine, CDEs said. "It's effective but not as effective as newer insulin medicine," Kerwin said.
Another option is to check insulin manufacturers' websites. Many insulin manufacturers offer assistance programs for patients who qualify, CDEs said.
In addition, Eli Lilly and Company announced recently that its Insulin Lispro Injection is available for order in pharmacies for people who use Lilly's rapid-acting insulin and need a lower-cost option. The medicine has a 50 percent lower list price that its identical medicine, Humalog U-100, Lilly said.
A third option is to check with your pharmacist, CDEs said. For example, Wal-Mart sells one insulin medicine for $25 a vial, Schlatter and Enstrom said. The website www.goodrx.com allows consumers to compare prices of prescriptions from area pharmacies, Kerwin said.
Regarding the Manar legislation, Schlatter said "I'm happy we're taking any action against this price-gouging."
Wakeland said "DMH (Decatur Memorial Hospital) supports the concept of reducing the financial burden for patients who have a chronic disease such as diabetes."
Kerwin called the legislation "a good thing to look at."
Beal wasn't comfortable taking a position on the legislation but added "Any reduction in cost for the patient is helpful."
Enstrom said "I think it's what we need to do."
>
Bob Goodlick, who was diagnosed with diabetes more than 15 years ago, was able to manage it with a sensible diet and weight management for the first few years, then was prescribed medication. He has been on insulin for about five years.
He gives himself an injection of 55 units of Humulin R U-500 in the morning before breakfast and 25 units in the evening before dinner. The farmer admits it's a challenge to manage when he's in the field.
"I would say it works pretty darn good," Goodlick said of the insulin. "But I gotta be awful careful. If my blood sugar bottoms out, I feel drained."
As to the legislation, Goodlick said, "That would be nice. But I don't know how they'd get that passed."

Phil Nadeau: African migrants and the US/Mexican border

Texto completo: During a recent television interview, a Portland reporter appeared surprised to hear that African asylum seekers had been arriving in Lewiston for years. He was also unaware of the fact that during the past four years, African asylum seekers made up, on average, about 83% of all new immigrant arrivals processed by Social Services.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-7514849" src="https://i2.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/Phil-Nadeau-BW-2012.jpg?resize=227%2C300&ssl=1" alt="" width="227" height="300" data-recalc-dims="1" />
Though both Lewiston and Portland have experienced increases in African asylum seeker arrivals, both cities have been unable to answer what has contributed to these increases beyond the U.S. border. Though I have retired from public service, my interest in looking deeper into the Maine African asylum seeker numbers produced the following perspective.
Much has been published locally about Portland’s 300 asylum seekers from San Antonio. The New York Times reported that both San Antonio and Customs officials have knowledge of Portland and Maine’s policy to lend support to asylum seekers and reported the speculation that this may or may not be responsible for the arrivals. What has been less publicized in Maine is the impact that many Trump administration and European Union refugee policies may be exerting on increasing African arrivals at the U.S. border.
According to Mexico’s interior ministry, 1,900 new African migrants arrived in Mexico during the first four months of 2019 — triple the number during the same four months of 2018. Additionally, the ministry reported that, in 2018, some 3,000 Africans were temporarily residing in Mexico awaiting U.S. entry — a number five times higher than in 2013.
It is important to note that African arrivals at the border are a fraction (less than 0.5%) of the 100,000-plus migrants apprehended since March. Also, consider that between 1983 and 2001 (not including 1988 and 1989) more than 1,000,000 migrants annually were apprehended at U.S. borders, an average of approximately 83,000 people per month. Very few African migrants came to the U.S. border during this period. Compare that to the past five fiscal years where monthly apprehensions dropped to approximately 42,000 per month. During that period, African-U.S. border arrivals began to increase.
In the U.S., what was, in years past, a small number of Africans attempting to secure a trans-Atlantic flight or boat trip to South America, followed by a difficult and dangerous journey to the U.S. border, is now being seen as a high-risk but doable option. The Migration Policy Institute reported that Trump administration actions to limit migrant entry into the U.S., and recent EU refugee policy decisions, have resonated globally. The EU policy focus has been to restrict or block entry and the U.S. has followed suit. Consequently, many who seek refuge see a narrowing window to gain entry into the U.S. and EU.
In the EU, Council leaders implemented a 2018 policy to create regional disembarkation platforms outside the EU following the 2015 arrival of more than 1,000,000 migrants. Located in Libya, these disembarkation detention facilities serve migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean into Europe. Apprehended by EU-trained and equipped Libyan Coast Guard personnel, migrants are returned to Libya and placed in locally operated detention centers while awaiting limited UN evacuation opportunities to Niger. Many detainees are from sub-Saharan countries like Congo and Angola.
Similar to the EU response, the Trump administration’s recent implementation of the migration protection protocols, aka, the “Remain in Mexico” policy, are resulting in sending more apprehended migrants to Mexico for asylum processing.
Fareed Zakaria’s column (June 30) declared that U.S. asylum policy created the current border “crisis.” I do not understand why he did not make clear that this “humanitarian” crisis is inextricably linked to recent EU and U.S. refugee policy actions and to the growing instability around the world which has pushed the number of globally displaced persons to more than 70 million people — a record, according to the UN.
Zakaria’s call to also toughen U.S. asylum policy is precisely what has happened in both the EU and the U.S. — yet the numbers are increasing at U.S. borders. In April, the Trump administration proposed new asylum rules that would cut off any available immigration relief for U.S asylum seekers once they apply for asylum.
In the end, people will move to seek safety in the face of hopelessness and death. I fear that the U.S. will see more Africans risk the trans-Atlantic trip in the face of increasing hopelessness.
Phil Nadeau served as Lewiston’s Deputy City Administrator from 1999 to 2017. He served as the city’s primary media and public contact for immigration information and policy and has been published nationally and was a contributing author in the book “Somalis in Maine.”

U.S. Investment in African University Fails as China Advances; Unraveling of Ghana project sets back America's plan to counter China's growing influence in Africa

Texto completo: When the U.S. government's private-investment arm teamed with New York-based real-estate investor W.P. Carey Inc. to finance the expansion of a prestigious university in Ghana, it was meant to demonstrate a novel for-profit funding model for development projects in Africa.
Instead, it left a wasteland of unfinished lecture halls, dormitories and a pile of litigation. And it marked a high-profile setback for U.S. government efforts to counter China's growing investment influence on the continent.
The project at the University of Ghana was a public-private partnership including the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corp., known as OPIC, and W.P. Carey, owner of the New York Times headquarters. Launched in 2015, it was meant to provide accommodation for 984 students and facilities to teach science, technology, education and humanities.
OPIC provides loans and insurance for projects in developing countries. It usually partners with American companies. But some of the biggest American investors, including private-equity firms KKR & Co. and Blackstone Group Inc., are stepping back from Africa, a priority region for OPIC and China. OPIC's partners in the Ghana project don't have a record of completing African projects.
President Trump and Congress last year doubled OPIC's funding capacity to $60 billion. The goal: to help OPIC compete with China's $1 trillion Belt and Road program to build infrastructure including universities, railroads and power plants world-wide.
OPIC wants to build "the greatest development force in the history of the world," Chief Executive David Bohigian said in a March interview. The agency provides alternatives to Chinese funding for Indonesian banks, Pakistani wind farms, Indian hospitals, Nigerian power plants, Middle Eastern private-equity funds and Vietnamese fish farmers. It has earned annual profits since 1974.
But OPIC's reliance on private companies as partners means its foreign-policy objectives must usually align with their profit targets. By contrast, Chinese President Xi Jinping has state-controlled companies and banks that are able to help enact foreign policy. Chinese investment in Africa is rising , more than doubling to $43.3 billion between 2011 and 2017. U.S. investment in Africa fell 12% to $57 billion over that period.
In African higher education, China is racing ahead. It committed $671 million between 2000 and 2014, more than double the U.S., according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and AidData, a research group at the College of William & Mary. In November, China completed a multimillion-dollar university library in Tanzania. Confucius Institutes teach Chinese across Africa. More Africans study in China than in the U.S.
The Ghana project was meant to be the biggest expansion since the U.K. built the university in 1948 in its Gold Coast colony. It was touted as a model for the continent with the youngest population and lowest access to higher education.
"West African universities, like the University of Ghana, are unable to expand enrollment due to the lack of long-term funding needed to construct new academic facilities," OPIC said in 2015. "This is contributing in part to the migration of educated West Africans to Europe and the U.S."
American businesswoman Andrea Pizziconi started the project. She founded Africa Integras LLC in 2008 to compete with Chinese developers. She hasn't yet completed a university project in Africa.
W.P. Carey invested, expecting a high financial return to compensate for the risk, people familiar with the deal said. OPIC agreed to lend $41 million and provide political risk insurance. The loan wasn't drawn.
The announced cost was $64 million. Developers stood to earn more. They planned to lease the buildings to the university for 25 years for more than $600 million, according to a copy of the agreement. Tax breaks could have reduced the rent, project documents show.
Construction began in 2015, but the project soon unraveled. A new vice chancellor installed in 2016 opposed the deal and was quoted in Ghanaian news media saying it "enslaves" the university. Construction halted. The university and developers blamed each other. OPIC tried to intervene but the project was terminated in 2017.
Across campus, students can access a $37.5 million computer system. A Chinese company installed it with cheap funding. Export-Import Bank of China provided a 19-year loan with a five-year grace period and an annual interest rate of 2% thereafter.
Failure didn't prevent W.P. Carey from profiting. A London-based lawyer determined a $165.8 million termination fee for the aborted project in 2018. Instead of pursuing payment, W.P. Carey, which says it has a core principle of "doing good while doing well," claimed a $45.6 million insurance policy from OPIC and Chubb, resulting in a gain of at least $10 million. Whether to enforce the termination fee is up to the insurers, a W.P. Carey spokesman said.
The university said it would "vigorously defend itself against all claims, using all legal avenues," in a July 9 statement.
"The U.S. government is working extensively with the parties to resolve these issues," an OPIC spokeswoman said. Chubb declined to comment.
"W.P. Carey's conduct was extremely callous and disrespectful to every stakeholder," said Ms. Pizziconi, who has offered to complete the buildings. "They terminated a project that had the potential to educate hundreds of thousands of students over decades and left stakeholders including Africa Integras with millions in losses, except for W.P. Carey whose outsized profits are a matter of public record."
W.P. Carey "was excited about the opportunity," the company spokesman said, and "disappointed that the university ultimately decided not to move forward."

Texto completo: Fear is your friend when the market seems low, but also when it is up, like now, and seems too high for so many people.
Fund managers of all types, for example, are at their most pessimistic since the financial crisis, a recent survey showed.
But as Warren Buffett famously preached: Be fearful when others are greedy – and greedy when others are fearful.
Such fear is ironic as stocks hit all-time highs last week. That means the Bank of America's fund-manager survey is merely one sign of today's rampant fear. And the American Association of Individual Investors' weekly survey showed less than 30% of retail investors think stocks will rise over the next six months.
At the same time, investor sentiment and economic confidence gauges across Europe are tanking. Headlines echo these fears, driving folks to yank money from stock mutual funds and ETFs in four of the previous six weeks through mid-June.
Sour sentiment is bullish. Why? Markets pre-price widely known information – fears, opinions, forecasts and more. When you see headlines warning of tariffs, Brexit, Iran, or Europe's allegedly imploding economy, understand that stocks already considered them.
Anything less bad is a positive surprise, hence bullish. Consider this bull market's March 2009 birth. Folks feared a new Great Depression. The recession we got was big and bad, but not that big. Stocks rose while the economy fell. U.S. stocks jumped 72.3% in the bull's first 12 months.
Consider today's big fears, such as Iran's threats to close the Strait of Hormuz and choke oil supply. Investors' dread is priced in now. Anything tamer brings relief. Tamer is likely, because of ample global supply and the fact that Iran can't really block the strait. Tankers have been attacked in years past, which wasn't good – but it was no economic crisis either.
What about European economic fears? A slow-growing economy with weak manufacturing beats recession. Bullish!
How about Brexit? By now, any darned development on that front beats expectations. As for tariffs, have you noticed, as I predicted here last August in great detail, that tariffs only take a nibble from global output, rather than cause the much-feared recession? It's another pre-priced fear. Again, bullish.
I've often said bull markets end one of two ways: One, atop the legendary "wall of worry" as euphoria makes positive surprise essentially unattainable. Or the wallop – a multitrillion dollar negative shock. The 2007-09 financial crisis was a wallop. But every other post-WWII bull market ended in euphoria. That matches Sir John Templeton's legendary framework: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria." Absent a wallop, bull markets end when investors tire of worrying.
We're nowhere near that today. Stocks still have a big wall of worry to climb. At a true euphoric peak, sentiment surveys boast optimism. Money pours into stock mutual funds and ETFs. Headlines cite as many opportunities as risks. The investment world will ridicule the bears, not the bulls. You'll fear missing gains more than fear suffering losses. If I write that bad times loom, you'll call me crazy.
Sentiment isn't a timing tool, of course. Euphoria is more like a dimmer switch than an on-off switch. To see euphoria correctly when it comes, you must think differently than others do. Instead of letting widespread fears send you scampering, envision what they say about sentiment broadly. When you see people excited to own stocks and dismissing risks, then start thinking about your exit.
Today, they do the opposite. Their fear is your future fortune.

Texto completo: In 2000, the Broward County Public Schools in Florida hired a consultant and physicist named Bill P. Curry to explore a nerve-racking question: Would installing wireless networks pose any health risks to the district's 250,000 students?
Yes, he replied, in a report that included an alarming graph suggesting students' brains would be exposed to significant amounts of radiation.
Much of the anxiety over the risks of cellphones and emerging 5G technology can be traced back to that single graph. But as the New York Times recently pointed out, there's one problem: Curry, who lacked biological expertise, got it wrong.
Experts say he failed to account for the protective effect of human skin, which shields organs, including the brain, from higher radio frequencies.
So go ahead. Give your teen all the smartphone time she wants. Her brain is safe from radiation — even if it's not safe from Instagram.

Texto completo: New York Harbor
Dear Diary:
In summer 1976, I was a young Coast Guardsman attending school on Governors Island. The session lasted 11 weeks.
At the time, there was a special ferry that ran between the island and a spot on the Battery near the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. A group of us took it to Manhattan one night, and then went up to Times Square.
We lost track of time, and returned to the Battery around 1 a.m. to discover that we had missed the last ferry back.
As we sat there wondering how much trouble we were in, a small harbor tug nosed up to the pier. A window on the wheelhouse opened, and a man poked his grizzled face out.
"You guys need a ride to the island?" he asked.
"Yes!" we shouted in unison.
We climbed over the bow onto the tug and set off on a quick late-night voyage, the lights of the city shining in every direction.

Rainy and Wet
Dear Diary:
It was a dismal, rainy day in May, and my mood matched the weather.
When I got on the train headed home after work, it was packed as usual. It was also wet from all the drenched raincoats, Wellingtons and umbrellas.
As people got off at each stop, the crowd began to thin out and there were eventually some empty seats. I started to sit in one, but pulled back when I saw a puddle that would have soaked my backside.
The man in the seat next to it noticed my predicament. He used the sleeve of his raincoat to wipe the seat dry. He looked up at me and smiled, and then he returned to highlighting the document on top the briefcase lying across his lap.

Family Trait
Dear Diary:
I manage a brasserie in SoHo where I see many familiar faces. I was pleasantly surprised one night to see a petite older woman whose red hair and shy smile made her instantly recognizable even though it had been years since she had come in.
She was happy that I recognized her, and that I remembered her husband had died a few years earlier, which is why she hadn't been around. She said she hadn't felt brave enough to come in on her own to have a drink at the bar. Now that she had dared to do it, she said, she was happy to have made the decision.
I reminded her of a sweet gift she had given my daughters many years ago: a signed copy of a children's book she had written. Hearing that made her even happier.
I wanted to tell her that bravery must be a family trait. Her name is Edwina Sandys and her grandfather was none other than Winston Churchill. I kept that thought to myself, though, as she walked bravely to the bar.
She had a fabulous time, charming the bartenders and a few customers. When she left, she was clearly proud of herself. She thanked me on her way out.
It made my night.

Scrabbled
Dear Diary:
In the late 1990s, I lived in Bay Ridge with two roommates. We were all new to New York City and to the world of work, so funds were always short.
We entertained ourselves by playing Scrabble. A lot. We spent hours trying to one up each other. Over the course of our many games we lost some tiles: L, X and S. We didn't know where to get replacements, and none of us wanted to splurge on buying a whole new game.
One day, as I waited to cross the street on my way to the R train station, I looked down and saw a bunch of Scrabble tiles in the street. And not just any tiles, but the dark wood ones that matched our set. The letters we were missing were there.
I quickly scooped up the tiles I needed and left the rest behind. Perhaps we weren't the only ones who needed some replacements.
-- Faith Shapiro

Easter Sunday
Dear Diary:
It was Easter Sunday and I had made the 7:07 train from South Norwalk to Grand Central by the skin of my teeth. The cars were packed -- standing room only. I managed to find a comfortable spot where I could lean against the wall with a bit of personal space.
At 125th Street, a young woman got off the train, leaving behind a Williams Sonoma shopping bag. A man standing across from me opened it to find a new, hardcover copy of "The Immortalists" and what looked like leftovers from an Easter lunch.
"Does it make me a jerk if I keep the book?" he asked me.
"If you don't take it, someone else will," I replied enviously. "The Immortalists" was on my list of books to read, and hardcovers were a luxury beyond my postgraduate-student budget.
He nodded and tucked the book under his arm.
Halfway up the platform at Grand Central, I felt a hand at my elbow. It was the guy from the train.
"I never do this," he said, "but would you like to go out sometime?"
"Sure," I said, smiling, "if you promise to share that book."

Texto completo: The Seagram liquor company and the ancient Mesoamerican civilization of the Olmecs were not obvious bedfellows. But in 1965, a crane operator lowered a colossal Olmec sculpture of a head onto the corporation's Manhattan doorstep. The artwork was awe-inspiring enough that its next stop was the World's Fair, but, for a time, it sat in front of Seagram's new Mies van der Rohe skyscraper on Park Avenue. Hosting the sculpture was an audacious move on the company's part. The juxtaposition of the Olmecs' pockmarked basalt and the building's sleek glass and bronze exterior made a statement about where mankind had been and where it was going. Also, intentionally or not, it was a pretty epic pun on the phrase "how to get ahead in business."
Corporations have long had some of the most extraordinary, and surprising, art collections in the world. Even if you don't have fundamentally warm feelings about insurance companies or financial institutions, there's no denying that the works owned by, say, JPMorgan Chase, IBM, Bank of America, UBS, Progressive, PepsiCo, the Cleveland Clinic and John Deere -- yes, John Deere -- have enriched lives and lobbies. Do companies sometimes buy art just to impress clients, intimidate opposing lawyers or engage in a kind of cultural arms race with other corporations? No doubt. But they also buy work to inspire their staffs and satisfy a C.E.O.'s or board's genuine aesthetic interests in art, from the Olmecs onward. "Corporations are showing fantastic works to the public," said Nina del Rio, a vice chairman at Sotheby's. "So, in my view, that's the great thing. There are bank branches around this country where you could walk in and see a Rauschenberg installation."
It's not uncommon for a company's art to appreciate in value even as winter comes for the economy in general. Says del Rio, "That's when we see corporations saying, 'This work that I bought for $ 5,000 is now worth $ 500,000 or $ 5 million. We could be making much better use of our funds.' Especially if the corporation is in a downturn and considering staff layoffs, how can you justify keeping a $ 5 million painting on the wall?" In other words, if a piece disappears from a public space, it may be because it's been too good an investment.
One of these images from The New York Times's archives seems to be of a random -- albeit quite elegantly dressed -- couple looking down at the street from the 60th floor of the Chase Manhattan building in New York. But you could argue that the true subject of the photo is David Rockefeller, who is not actually in it. Rockefeller was the godfather of corporate collecting. He hosted the man and woman for lunch that day in 1965, and was also responsible for acquiring the stark, almost hieroglyphic artwork by Kumi Sugai that dominates the back wall. When del Rio was shown the photograph and told that the happy couple was Princess Margaret and her husband, the Earl of Snowdon, she politely said, "How cool." A second later, however, it became clear where her true passion lay: "But look at that painting."

Texto completo: La campaña del presidente Donald Trump para la reelección 2020 está en pleno apogeo y toca arremeter contra todo lo que suene progresista. Al fin y al cabo, incluso los análisis del prestigioso diario The New York Times -poco sospechoso de ser trumpista- le auguran mejores resultados que en 2016, en parte por el tono beligerante del mandatario hacia sus rivales políticos.
En esta batalla discursiva, la nueva enemiga del candidato a la reelección es la lucha por la reducción de pláticos . El equipo de campaña del presidente sacó una serie de popotes (pajitas, pitillos, bombillas) “100% estadounidenses” para plantar cara a lo que considera una idea “progresista”: los popotes de papel .
Liberal paper straws don’t work.
STAND WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP and buy your pack of recyclable straws today!https://t.co/nanyEFK938
— Team Trump (@TeamTrump) July 18, 2019
“Las pajitas de papel son solo otro ejemplo de los fallidos excesos regulatorios liberales. Pero no temas, ¡el presidente Trump tiene la solución perfecta!”, escribió el director de la campaña de Trump, Brad Parscale, en un comunicado divulgado este viernes.
El asesor dijo que las de papel son “como las ideas liberales, que no funcionan y se vienen abajo al instante” e invitó a los usuarios a hacerse con ellas “hoy mismo”. Y le hicieron caso. Los “popotes Trump”, un pack de diez unidades a 15 dólares, se agotaron este mismo viernes.
Con esta campaña el mandatario insiste en su negacionismo ante el alarmante cambio climático y se burla del tremendo impacto que estos artículos tienen sobre el medio ambiente .
Las pajitas solo suponen el 4% de los desechos plásticos pero -según el diario El País- su pequeño tamaño dificulta que las instalaciones de reciclaje las puedan atrapar y la mayoría termina en ríos y océanos. Solo en Estados Unidos, estiman los sitios web de los Parques Nacionales del país, cada día se utilizan más de 500 millones de absorbentes. Una situación que recientemente llevó a ciudades como Washington o Seattle a prohibirlos.

Texto completo: Headnote Comedian
A comedian, radio and TV host, author, actor, dancer, husband, father, and so much more, D.L. Hughley is ready to tackle the next item on his busy schedule.
"My current plate is pretty full," says Darryl Lynn Hughley - better known as D.L.
One of the original Kings of Comedy, Hughley released his second book in 2016, titled "Black Man, White House," a faux history of the Barack Obama years. That book made the New York Times Bestseller List.
Hughley is best known as the original host of BET's ComicView from 1992 to 1993, the main character on the ABC/UPN sitcom The Hughleys, and as one of the "Big Four" comedians in The Original Kings of Comedy (he accompanied Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac).
Now Hughley is hard at work on his next book.
"My latest book comedically deals with a peace treaty between America and people of color," he explains. "I hope to be finished by November and the book should be out by the spring of 2020."
But with it all, Hughley insists his life's work is looking deep into what makes people tick - especially those who lead and those who follow.
"I think I've always been interested in what powerful people do that affects others. And I think now, more than ever, politics has sort of morphed into pop culture," Hughley is quick to point out.
Raised in L.A.'s South Central neighborhood, Hughley explains that he's always done things that made people look at him sideways, but can't say he's always been a funny person.
"It's ironic to me that people think I've always been funny. I'm inclined to look at myself as just being who I am, and I found a profession that is tailor-made for my personality. I just had to find out who I was," he says.
So who is he?
"I think I'm many things, including a husband and father, a comedian, a writer. I'm also a person who's flawed, and a person who loves humanity. I'm a person who's a whole lot of things," Hughley says.
Soon to appear at the Helium Comedy Club, Aug. 9-11, Hughley says he's looking forward to coming to Philadelphia, the place where he filmed his 11th special, "D.L. Hughley: Contrarian."
And in order to prepare for his material that often touches on political issues as well as pop culture, Hughley says he's a great reader, and has to be in order to write the things he wants to share with his audience.
"I read constantly and tend to read things I'm not always in agreement with. So I try to read local stuff. I try to read international stuff. I try to read conservative stuff as well as liberal stuff.
"I'm a very busy person," he continues, "but I genuinely love everything I do. I get up and do my radio and TV show essentially at the same time. I need to read a lot to do those shows, as well as my stand-up. It's all virtually the same thing. I think the ingredients are all connected and encompass who I am. There's always something interesting percolating in the country, so I try to find my own take on it."
Now doing his stand-up in Birmingham, Alabama, a place, he notes, "that has passed some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. It's a most interesting place, with one of the longest constitutions in American history. And all of it means NO!"

MOON LANDING FELT LIKE A MIRACLE - BUT IT CAME AT AN ASTRONOMICAL PRICE

Texto completo: As the three Apollo 11 astronauts approached the moon 50 years ago this week, Pittsburgh, like the rest of the country, watched with awe - along with some silliness and some doubts.
The township of Moon hosted an all-day celebration featuring a re-enactment in which an "astronaut" parachuted from a helicopter and landed in the "Sea of Tranquility" - the town park. A baby born in Harrison one minute after the July 20 landing was given the middle name Diana - the Roman goddess of the moon.
And the Post-Gazette spoke to two locals named Neil Armstrong. "I'm glad it was him and not me," said Neil J. Armstrong, of New Kensington.
Amid the celebration, though, there were dissenters. Splashed across the pages of the city's papers were the voices of Pittsburghers who wondered whether the billions of dollars devoted to the Apollo program would have been better spent on anti-poverty programs or on the Vietnam War effort.
A Post-Gazette editorial from July 18, 1969, pointed to the "uglier side of the moon expedition," noting that in the shadow of the Apollo launch site in Florida, "some 7,000 earthlings of the same nationality as the astronauts struggle to avoid death by starvation."
The critics were correct in saying that the effort to put humans on the moon was a hugely expensive and resource-sucking endeavor. The Apollo program, launched by President John F. Kennedy in 1961, employed more than 400,000 people and cost more than $24 billion (more than $150 billion in today's dollars) - the costliest peacetime mobilization in history.
In the half-century since those missions, a sort of legend has taken hold that emphasizes the primitive technology that those early Apollo astronauts had to work with. The best example may be the Apollo guidance computer, which charted the spacecraft's course, using only about 64 kilobytes of memory - less than in most modern toasters and a tiny fraction of the memory in the smartphones we fit in our pockets
But the focus on the technology's simplicity distracts from how remarkable it really was, says Jay Apt, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering and a former astronaut who flew four NASA missions between 1985 and 1997. Mr. Apt referred to a well-known saying that Apollo 11 was "a piece of 21st century technology that was picked up by Jack Kennedy and moved into the 20th century."
"The technology that was used in Apollo was truly stunning in many ways," he said.
It's hard to overstate how far the program went in just eight years. In a new book on the Apollo program, excerpted in Smithsonian Magazine, historian Charles Fishman wrote that when Kennedy set his 1961 goal, the U.S. lacked nearly all of the equipment needed for a moon mission - it had no rockets, launchpads, spacesuits or computers that were up to the task. Some doctors even feared that astronauts would lose the ability to think in low-gravity conditions.
Then there was the matter of actually landing on the moon. Early plans called for flying straight there and landing on the moon's surface - it wasn't until years into the planning that NASA realized this would have required an impractically huge rocket and enormous amounts of fuel.
Instead, they went with a lunar orbit rendezvous, in which the smaller "Eagle" lander detached from the main spacecraft, made its famous visit, then flew back up to rejoin the main craft circling the moon. This delicate maneuver set the example for future in-space dockings - including Mr. Apt's fourth spaceflight, in which the space shuttle rendezvoused and docked with the Russian space station Mir in 1996.
Mr. Apt also credited the Apollo planners for building multiple guidance modes into the lander's computer, allowing the pilot to gradually take control of more aspects of the navigation as it neared the moon.
"When the commander would want to take over just before landing to avoid some boulders, for example, he could have full control," Mr. Apt said.
When Cmdr. Neil Armstrong encountered unexpectedly rocky terrain in the spot where he'd planned to land, he used manual control to keep flying for a few more minutes, finally choosing a safer landing spot after burning much of the lander's limited fuel. The Eagle landed, and the rest was history.
A half-century later, space exploration no longer is the national focus that it was in the Apollo era. At the program's peak in the mid-1960s, the U.S. devoted more than 4% of its annual budget to NASA - today, it is less than half of 1%.
That shift in priorities has created opportunities for privately held space companies such as Astrobotic Technology, based in Downtown Pittsburgh. The company, founded in 2008, is partnering with NASA in an effort to land its own rover on the moon by 2021.
But Apollo still looms large. Almost every component of a modern spacecraft owes its existence to those missions, said Astrobotic CEO John Thornton, from computers to sensors to spacesuits. While the Apollo workers had to develop these components, today's companies can typically purchase them off the shelf.
"There's a $360 billion space industry worldwide that has built an industrial base of components that makes it very easy for folks to assemble spacecraft relative to the Apollo era," Mr. Thornton said. "What Apollo built is continuing today, because that was the foundation for the entire space industry."
Search "Apollo guidance computer" on eBay, and you'll find functional, 3D-printed replicas of the original device, on sale for a few thousand dollars. And the source code that powered the computer is freely available online, full of jokes and 1960s pop culture references left by the original programmers.
Given this continued legacy and public-private partnerships, Mr. Thornton doesn't see the government's declining spending on space as cause for concern. (NASA's funding actually ticked up in the most recent federal budget, approved in February.)
Mr. Apt said he's excited for what's to come. Aside from a mission to Mars, he cited a planned mission to explore Titan, a moon of Saturn, as well as the Trump administration's stated goal to land the first woman on the moon by 2024.
"Any of these things fire up my imagination," Mr. Apt said. "Taking people into space, wherever we go, is just tremendous."
There's something timeless about that sense of wonder, which, despite the concerns about Apollo's costs, seemed to be the prevailing emotion around Pittsburgh 50 years ago this week.
In the July 16, 1969, Pittsburgh Press, photographer Gilbert Love wrote a piece reflecting on the upcoming moon landing styled as a letter to his ancestors.
He described the vehicles, like carriages with engines, that propel us for hundreds of miles and the little boxes that transmit sounds from the other side of the world. "Fantastic developments have come to us so rapidly that we have almost ceased to marvel at them," he wrote.
"We have difficulties and perils these days, but nevertheless we're living in a golden age. Nowhere is it more evident than in our ability to see and hear the world in which we live and, increasingly, the universe."

Texto completo: Few people today remember Alexander von Humboldt, but the Prussian naturalist predicted climate change back in the early 19th century. “He’s the forgotten father of environmentalism,” says historian Andrea Wulf. 
During Humboldt’s travels through Venezuela in 1799, he noticed that farmers in the Aragua valley were deforesting the region to grow indigo. As a result, the nearby lake was drying up. Later, in a letter to President Thomas Jefferson dated June 1804, he wrote, “The wants and restless activity of large communities of men gradually despoil the face of the Earth.”
It was one of the first Western observations of human-caused climate change, according to Wulf. Environmentalists and scientists like Charles Darwin, John Muir, and Henry David Thoreau were heavily influenced by his writings, which were widely read during his lifetime. Wulf wanted to raise Humboldt’s profile for today’s readers. So she wrote “The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt,” a lush and meticulously illustrated history of his South American expedition. 
“I grew up in Germany, so we heard about [Humboldt] as an adventurer, or maybe a botanist,” Wulf says. “But no one talked about him as the man who had predicted harmful, human-induced climate change. So that became the thing that got me going.” She’s also the author of “The Invention of Nature,” a 2015 New York Times bestselling nonfiction book that delves more deeply into Humboldt’s life and influence. 
“The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt” stands apart with its rich visual presentation: It’s filled with Humboldt’s own drawings, maps, and writings, all sourced from the Berlin State Library’s digitized collection of his journals. Those are juxtaposed with a dizzying array of reproductions, including pressed botanical samples, landscape paintings, and photos. And it’s all stitched together by the artwork of Lillian Melcher, a recent Pratt Institute graduate.
“[Humboldt] was one of the first people to make science popular and accessible, because he used infographics in all of his books,” says Melcher. She believes strongly in following in his footsteps to increase scientific literacy. “I think that combination of science and art is a better way to learn,” she says.
Wulf and Melcher collaborated to storyboard the book; each page represents weeks’ worth of research. “Andrea and I are definitely the same kind of nerdy, where we just want accuracy. We want to know all the little details,” Melcher says. For example, the scanned pages of Humboldt’s diary which appear as background images on most pages of the book actually correspond to the events taking place in the story. When Humboldt’s boat capsized in the Orinoco River, his journals were stained with river water. Wulf and Melcher used reproductions of those diary pages to collage an image of the river, and Melcher drew Humboldt jumping into the pages to rescue his belongings. “He’s jumping through that watermark to rescue his diary, but it’s [also] the real watermark,” says Wulf. “It’s this double sense and I just love it.”
Humboldt’s interests were so wide-ranging that he found it hard to settle into a specific discipline. (That’s perhaps one of the reasons he fell into obscurity: As scientific thought progressed, narrower focuses took precedent.) The structure of “The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt” is a true reflection of his restless curiosity – always varied, sometimes digressive, it’s a kaleidoscopic view into the diverse, fascinating, and occasionally brutal landscape of the South America that he encountered. 
Intrinsic to Humboldt’s writings were his critiques of imperialism and slavery, as well as of environmental degradation. With startling prescience, he pointed out the economic, environmental, and human costs of slavery and silver mining in “Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain” and “Political Essay on the Island of Cuba.” Both are introduced in Wulf’s and Melcher’s book.
Importantly, he allowed his passion for nature to influence and color his work. “If I look at [today’s] climate change debate in the political arena ... what I’m really missing is that no one dares to talk about the wonders of nature,” says Wulf. “[Humboldt] says we need to feel nature. We need to use our imagination to understand nature. ... And this aspect of his work, I think, is what makes it incredibly relevant today.”
There’s no doubt Humboldt was intrepid. He fearlessly placed himself in harm’s way to gather knowledge, even if that meant climbing active volcanoes, crawling into mines, and prodding electric eels. When a ship he was on sailed into a hurricane with 40-foot waves, he sat down to calculate the exact angle at which the boat would capsize. Death would be better experienced methodically, he reasoned. (The ship stayed afloat.)
“The Adventures of Alexander von Humboldt” gives a true sense of the global scale of his imagination, and of the indomitable drive that enabled him to disseminate the scientific information he gathered to the next generation of scientists, writers, and artists. Western civilization at large is only now beginning to understand what Humboldt intuited in the early 19th century: “In this great chain of causes and effects, no single fact can be considered in isolation.”

Texto completo: The phrase “America, Love It or Leave It” has a pedigree dating back at least to the McCarthy Era. In the ’70s, the phrase was employed again against those protesting America’s involvement in the Vietnam War. The left has its own version, vowing to leave the country if a Republican is elected president. They rarely do.
On Monday, President Trump resurrected the phrase as he again publicly slammed four freshman congresswomen for their criticism of the United States and his policies. He suggested they “go back where you came from,” though they are all American citizens.
Whatever one thinks of the president’s remarks – the predictable “racist” charge was leveled at him because the four are women of color and two are Muslim – the president is setting Democrats up for what could be a major defeat in the 2020 election by forcing them to embrace (probably) these people and their statements, thus causing further fallout within the party, or denounce them (unlikely) and risk electoral harm. It’s a lose-lose for Democrats.
AXIOS, a nonpartisan news and information company, shared the results of a small, exclusive poll taken in May of a “crucial group of swing voters.” Respondents, “1,003 likely general-election voters who are white and have two years or less of college education,” put their approval of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley in low double or single digits.
Only last week did Speaker Nancy Pelosi, discussing the congresswomen’s opposition to the emergency border aid bill – a bill the leadership supported – seem to dismiss them in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, “They’re four people, and that’s how many votes they got.” After the president’s comments Monday, Pelosi felt obligated to defend the four congresswomen, but that may come at a cost.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., took things a step too far when he called the four “anti-America” communists on “Fox and Friends,” another throwback to the McCarthy Era, which Graham has previously denounced.
Still, this is likely to play well with people who believe too many politicians spend most of their time criticizing America instead of defending it.
The four congresswomen have been critical of the nation they were elected to serve, and some have even made anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements.
The left swims in a deep sea of hypocrisy when it uses buzzwords like “diversity” and “racism.” A recent example was in Monday’s Washington Times. The newspaper reported that congressional Democrats are opposing four “people of color” nominated to federal courts by President Trump. If a Democratic president had nominated these people and Republicans opposed them, is there any doubt the “racist” slur would be hurled at them?
Still, Sen. Graham was right when he also said it would be helpful if the president would “aim higher” and speak of their policies, rather than engaging in personal attacks. But their hatred for Israel and anti-America statements ARE their policies. Graham is correct in this sense: President Trump has the issues on his side. He is winning on things most people care about, especially the economy. Yes, he frequently touts successes, but they are often overshadowed by his personal attacks.
Winning an argument is better than winning a fight. Winning the argument proves your policies are correct. Winning a fight proves nothing, except who is able to beat up another person. It does not advance an agenda.
There is no excuse for calling detention centers “concentration camps” and likening the Border Patrol to Nazi prison guards, especially since the four freshmen and other Democrats have the power to fix the migrant crisis, but won’t because it appears they prefer having the issue to batter Republicans.
If this keeps up, House Democrats who defend such outrageous statements are likely to find themselves in the minority again. Many Americans are fed up with hearing this stuff and are likely to take revenge at the polls.

Remnants of War

Texto completo: Intense fighting and hideous attacks battered Afghans throughout their country last week as negotiators in Qatar weighed the benefits and costs of a peace agreement that might stop the bloodshed.
In Kabul at least 40 people, including one child, were killed in a complex Taliban attack. Dozens of children whose school was partially collapsed by a massive car bomb were injured. Of these, 21 were hospitalized with serious injuries.
New York Times correspondent Mujib Mashal posted (on Twitter) a photo of an elementary school child being carried into the Italian Emergency Surgical Center for Victims of War in Kabul. "Blood on his face," Mashal writes, describing the child. "Still in shock. Still clutching that pencil."
The same attack damaged a television station, a government facility and an adjoining private war museum.
Operated by OMAR (Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation), a group dedicated to the never-ending and often dangerous work of mineclearance and disposal, the war museum houses ordnance and land mines used in Afghanistan during four decades of warfare. In 2012, young Afghan Peace Volunteers took me to see the museum.
I recall a small exhibit showing remnants of a United States antipersonnel cluster bomb. The remnants are called bomblets, and each cluster bomb consists of 202 bomblets. They resemble children's playthings, items that could be stepped on, driven over or picked up by curious children. They are sometimes lethal, sometimes "only" inflict hideous wounds.
The U.S. dropped 1,228 cluster bombs in Afghanistan between October 2001 and March 2002 alone. The Afghan landscape is now littered by anti-personnel and anti-tank mines which OMAR is striving to remove, where permitted, before more Afghan civilians are killed. Research by the Mine Action Program of Afghanistan indicates, in the first three months of the current year, 130 Afghan boys and girls were casualties of "ERW:" "Explosive Remnants of War."
As negotiations inched forward, two Afghan government airstrikes, possibly using United States assistance, hit civilians, killing seven members of a family in the Baghlan province and four civilians in a clinic in Maidan Wardak province.
The Taliban, U.S. Government, and every other warring party in Afghanistan must be asked: "How many more civilians, including children, are you willing to kill and maim?"
The second time I visited the OMAR museum was with my friend Martha Hennessy. We were asked not to take photos, but Martha had already snapped a picture of a carpet carefully woven to illustrate several types of land mines Afghans should watch out for. The carpet was hung on a wall, but actual mines lie in the paths to be traversed by innocent Afghans. On the phone with me discussing the recent Kabul attack, Martha mentioned that carpet and reflected on the terrible carpeting of Afghanistan with barbarous ordnance.
Martha now faces up to 20 years in prison for protesting the most barbarous and inhumane weaponry ever invented.
Martha, a granddaughter of the Catholic Worker Movement's founder Dorothy Day, is one of seven activists, the "King's Bay Plowshares 7," whose April 4, 2018 action was in accord with their deeply held beliefs that life is sacred, and must not be taken in war. The U.S. naval base at King's Bay, Georgia houses nuclear-missile-armed Trident submarines, enough to kill every human on Earth many times over. Entering without permission, they hung banners, displayed crime scene tape and poured their own blood on the base grounds. They protested the U.S. preparations, far exceeding those of any other nation, to commit "omnicide," to carpet the world in in fire, in fallout, in the snows of a deadly "nuclear winter," in ash.
For the past 15 months, they've awaited trial on charges of conspiracy, destruction of property on a naval station, depredation of government property, and trespass. They feel that U.S. readiness for war must be put on trial now, or potentially never.
Another of Martha's co-defendants has been a guest, like us, of the Afghan Peace Volunteers. Our friend Carmen Trotta recalls a visit to the Emergency Surgical Center for Victims of War, an Italy-based hospital that treated many victims of the recent Kabul attacks. In 2014 we had visited the hospital to donate blood, and met Jamshaid and Farshaid, young teens who had survived a suicide bomb attack on the United States military base in Bagram. They had been standing outside their school outside the base when the attack happened. Farshaid's leg had been amputated. Jamshaid had lost much of his vision. We asked Michaela Paschetto, a young Italian nurse, how they were faring.
"Today was a bad day for them," she said. "Really, I don't ask so many questions," she continued. "It becomes too much."
"I didn't know what to say," Carmen recalls. "I honestly couldn't think of a word to say."
Carmen, Martha and each of the Kings Bay Plowshares 7 will have their say, however brief, in a Brunswick County federal court on August 7. Oral arguments will be heard including several motions as well as their belief they opposed the U.S. nuclear arsenal in accord with their religious faith. They have consistently opposed weapons and wars and just as steadfastly served, as members of Dorothy Day's movement, their impoverished neighbors. They understand the wars, the omnicidal weapons awaiting their use at King's Bay, and the suffering of the U.S. poor as, in some sense, all part of a global war on the poor.
Depending on whether we resist or acquiesce, grieve or complacently ignore, we ourselves risk becoming the tragic, perpetually dangerous remnants of war.

Another app with privacy concerns: TikTok, a popular video app with ties to China

Resumen: The rise of FaceApp has sparked concerns about privacy. Experts say TikTok may pose similar concerns because it is owned by a Chinese tech giant.

Texto completo: The resurgence of St. Petersburg, Russia-based FaceApp has sparked renewed concerns about online privacy, and popular video app TikTok is also raising red flags among security experts.
TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, crossed the 1 billion mark for worldwide installs on the Apple App Store and Google Play, according to data published in February 2019 by Sensor Tower, an analyst group that focuses on the mobile market.
But many users don't know it is owned by a Chinese firm, according to CNBC. Experts told the outlet this is an intentional strategy that many Chinese technology firms use as they break into U. S. markets.
“Overall, there is low awareness about the origin of these apps,” Hanish Bhatia, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC in April. “So Chinese tech firms and apps are continuously making efforts to get rid of the Chinese tag. The idea is to position themselves as a global player. ”
In a statement to USA TODAY, a spokesperson from TikTok reiterated that protecting user privacy is a critical priority for the company.
"As part of our overall commitment to transparency, we are working with an independent, US-based internet privacy firm to audit our practices and confirm that we are employing industry-leading standards for the storage and protection of TikTok user data," the statement read.
#FaceAppChallenge: Using FaceApp to age your photos may be fun, but you could be giving up your privacy
TikTok has come under fire for privacy problems before
In February 2019 the Federal Trade Commission alleged TikTok – which merged with the musical. ly app last year – illegally collected personal information from children.
TikTok agreed to pay $5. 7 million to settle the FTC’s complaint, filed by the Department of Justice, which said the company violated the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or COPPA. The act requires websites and online services to direct children under 13 to get parental consent before the company collects personal information.
TikTok is also being investigated by the United Kingdom's Information Commissioner’s Office to determine if it violated the European Union’s data privacy law called GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which requires companies provide specific protections related to children and their data, The Guardian reported.
In a recent piece for Quartz, David Carroll, a professor of media design at The New School in Manhattan, highlighted a concerning section of TikTok's privacy policy which in late 2018 said that user data may be transferred to China. That section was revised after the company's settlement with the FTC.
He said TikTok confirmed his statement that "data from TikTok users who joined the service before February 2019 may have been processed in China," but also offered a clarification of their current privacy policy:
"TikTok user data is stored and processed in the U. S. and other markets where TikTok operates at industry-leading third-party data centers. It’s important to clarify that TikTok does not operate in China and that the government of the PRC has no access to TikTok users data. In the United States, TikTok is operated by our US entity. Data may be shared with others in our corporate group as defined in the Privacy Policy for the explained purposes. The privacy and security of our users is a top priority for TikTok, and we abide by local laws and regulations in the markets where we operate. "
Why should I be concerned?
In its privacy policy, TikTok says its "collects contact details, content you create, and your location," as well as "information contained in the messages you send through our Platform and information from your phone book, if you grant us access to your phone book on your mobile device. "
Carroll said in a tweet that because FaceApp is based in Russia and TikTok is based in China, it's "safe to assume those governments can readily access your data. "
Tech firms based outside of the U. S. are "subject to different standards or governance for data handling," Jason Hill, lead cybersecurity researcher at CyberInt, said. "Whilst many individuals may not be concerned by this, users working in government, military or sensitive roles may want to consider the ramifications of potentially exposing their personal data to foreign entities. "
While the app's primary demographic is teenagers and young adults, a report from Claudia Biancotti at the Peterson Institute of International Economics noted that there is an active sub-community of young military service members.
"Social apps gather a lot of data on users; if this information is sent to China, it can be easily accessed by the government and leveraged, say, to make Beijing’s surveillance software better at recognizing Western faces, or at extracting intelligence on Western military activities," Biancotti wrote.
Certain countries, such as Russia and China, "have shown little regard for the privacy of people using technologies based there," said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist for McAfee – a Santa Clara, Calif. -headquartered cloud cybersecurity company.
"It’s always best to err on the side of caution with any personal data and think carefully about what you are uploading or sharing," he said. "A good security practice is to only share personal data, including personal photos, when it’s truly necessary. ”

Vancouver woman on reality TV show
If you've tuned into “Love Island,” the latest addition in the coupling-and-uncoupling reality TV genre, perhaps you've noticed a local face.
Mallory Santic, 26, of Vancouver is competing on the U.S. version of the British show. It airs at 8 p.m. five nights a week on CBS, local Channel 6, and debuted July 9.
The Columbian couldn't reach Santic for an interview. As per the rules for the show, contestants' phones are taken away, they have no access to the internet and are not permitted contact with the outside world. Cameras follow their every move, leading a column in the New York Times to label “Love Island” a “riveting human rights violation.”
The show's website states that Santic graduated from Washington State University in 2015 with a degree in communications and media studies, and lists her occupation as “analyst for Nike.” It also notes that Santic “is obsessed with mermaids and has one tattooe

Former Justice Stevens dies at 99

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- John Paul Stevens, the bow-tied, independent-thinking, Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly emerged as the Supreme Court's leading liberal, died Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale after suffering a stroke Monday. He was 99.

During nearly 35 years on the court, Stevens stood for the freedom and dignity of individuals, be they students or immigrants or prisoners. He acted to limit the death penalty, squelch official prayer in schools, establish gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. He protected the rights of crime suspects and illegal immigrants facing deportation.

He influenced fellow justices to give foreign terrorism suspects held for years at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base the right to plead for their release in U.S. courts.

Stevens served more than twice the average tenure for a justice, and was only the second to mark his 90th birthday on the high court. From his appointment by President Gerald Ford in 1975 through his retirement in June 2010, he shaped decisions that touched countless aspects of American life.

"He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation," Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement.

The White House issued a statement saying President Donald Trump and the first lady offered their condolences to Stevens' family and friends and praising "his passion for the law and for our country."

He remained an active writer and speaker into his late 90s, surprising some when he came out against Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation following Kavanaugh's angry denial of sexual assault allegations. Stevens wrote an autobiography, "The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years," that was released just after his 99th birthday in April 2019.

At first considered a centrist, Stevens came to be seen as a lion of liberalism. But he rejected that characterization.

"I don't think of myself as a liberal at all," Stevens told The New York Times in 2007. "I think as part of my general politics, I'm pretty darn conservative."

The way Stevens saw it, he held to the same ground, but the court had shifted steadily to the right over the decades, creating the illusion that he was moving leftward.

He did change his views on some issues, however. He morphed from a critic of affirmative action to a supporter, and came to believe the death penalty was wrong.

His legal reasoning was often described as unpredictable or idiosyncratic, especially in his early years on the court. He was a prolific writer of separate opinions laying out his own thinking, whether he agreed or disagreed with the majority's ruling. Yet Stevens didn't consider his methods novel. He tended toward a case-by-case approach, avoided sweeping judicial philosophies, and stayed mindful of precedent.

The white-haired Stevens, eyes often twinkling behind owlish glasses, was the picture of old-fashioned geniality on the court and off. He took an unusually courteous tone with lawyers arguing their cases, but he was no pushover. After his fellow justices fired off questions, Stevens would politely weigh in. "May I ask a question?" he'd ask gently, then quickly slice to the weakest point of a lawyer's argument.

He voiced only one regret about his Supreme Court career: that he had supported reinstating the death penalty in 1976. More than three decades later, Stevens publicly declared his opposition to capital punishment, saying that years of bad court decisions had overlooked racial bias, favored prosecutors and otherwise undermined his expectation that death sentences could be handed down fairly.

One of his harshest dissents came when the court lifted restrictions on spending by corporations and unions to sway elections. He called the 2010 ruling "a rejection of the common sense of the American people" and a threat to democracy.

As he read parts of that opinion aloud, Stevens' voice wavered uncharacteristically and he repeatedly stumbled over words. For the 90-year-old who'd worried he wouldn't know when to bow out, it was a signal. "That was the day I decided to resign," Stevens said later. He also disclosed in his autobiography that he had suffered a mini-stroke. Justice Elena Kagan took Stevens' seat on the court.

A great-grandfather, Stevens eased into an active retirement of writing and speaking, still fit for swimming and tennis in Fort Lauderdale, where he and his second wife, Maryan, kept a home away from Washington.

Born in 1920, Stevens was a privileged child of a bygone era: He met Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh at the family hotel and was at the ballpark when Babe Ruth hit his famous "called-shot" home run in the 1932 World Series.

He joined the Navy the day before the attack on Pearl Harbor, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service with a Japanese code-breaking team. The code breakers' work enabled the U.S. to shoot down a plane carrying the commander of the Japanese Navy, and that targeted wartime killing later contributed to his misgivings about the death penalty.

After World War II, Stevens graduated first in his class at Northwestern University's law school and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge. As a lawyer he became an antitrust expert, experience he brought to Supreme Court rulings such as one ending the NCAA's control over televised college football games.

President Richard Nixon appointed Stevens, a lifelong Republican, to the federal appeals court in Chicago. Stevens was considered a moderate conservative when Ford -- whose nominee would need the approval of a Democratic-controlled Senate -- chose him for the Supreme Court.

Stevens won unanimous confirmation after uneventful hearings nothing like today's partisan shows. Stevens' liberal bent once on the high court was "different than I envisioned," Ford acknowledged decades later, but he still supported and praised him as "a very good legal scholar."

Texto completo: Nationwide drug overdose deaths fell last year for the first time since 1990, a decline mirrored statewide and locally, new data show.
The drop of 5.1% turned the tide on a nearly 30-year increase driven in recent years by heroin and other powerful opioids. The numbers come from preliminary data released Wednesday by the National Center for Health Statistics, which falls under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The decline amounts to about 3,000 fewer deaths, a number so slight that experts said it's too early to tell whether the drop is the start of a downward trend or just a blip.
"I'm cautiously optimistic," said Tim Phillips, director of Westmoreland County's Drug Overdose Task Force.
Overdose deaths dropped in the county from 193 in 2017 to 122 in 2018, according to numbers from Overdose Free PA, but Phillips said those numbers don't necessarily signal an end of the epidemic.
"People are still overdosing - they're just surviving," he said. "And as the opiate issues have leveled off, particularly the deaths, we've seen an increase in methamphetamine and cocaine. Drugs are a symptom of the disease of addiction."
Sixteen states saw an uptick in reported overdose deaths, with the largest, at 16.7%, occurring in Delaware. Most states that reported increases are in the South and Southwest, though Maryland, New Jersey and Vermont also saw a rise.
Patrick Trainor, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Agency in Philadelphia, told The New York Times that it's difficult to point to any one thing as the cause of the decline. He, too, said he's cautiously optimistic.
Statewide, overdose deaths dropped by nearly 20%, from 5,600 in 2017 to about 4,500 last year, according to the data.
In Allegheny County, overdose deaths fell more than 40%, from 737 in 2017 to 432 in 2018. County Medical Examiner Dr. Karl Williams last month called the decline "pleasant and largely unexpected."
It's still nearly twice as many fatal overdoses as the county saw in 2009: 256. In that year in Westmoreland County, there were 56. Armstrong County counted 23 fatal overdoses last year, down from 39 in 2017. In 2009, the number was four.
Dr. Karen Hacker, outgoing director of the Allegheny County Health Department, credits the decline both nationwide and locally in part to the availability of Naloxone, an overdose-reversal drug.
In April 2015, the state permitted first responders for all emergency services - including police and fire crews - to carry the life-saving drug. Later that year, a standing order made that prescription available to anyone.
According to numbers kept by the state, medics across Pennsylvania administered 22,001 doses of Naloxone between Jan. 1, 2018, and June 8, 2019. Last year, first responders in Allegheny County administered 915 doses; in Westmoreland, 252 doses. Armstrong County first responders administered 48 doses last year.
Hacker said public health officials have unanswered questions about the epidemic and its leveling off: How many people are just starting to use opioids, how many are transitioning to different drugs, and how many people are actually overdosing?
The prevalence of Naloxone, she said, could mean that fewer people are calling emergency services for an overdose.
"I think the term 'cautiously optimistic' is the right one," she said. "I think there's still a lot to be learned, but you can't help but feel positive."
The nationwide and state numbers are based on deaths that have officially been ruled as drug overdoses and open cases that public health officials believe will be ruled overdoses.
Phillips stressed that the decline is a positive sign but doesn't mean the fight against addiction should slow.
"We can't afford to put the brakes on now," he said. "We need to keep doing everything we've done and include more."

Texto completo: We all watched while Eric Garner desperately pleaded with New York Police Department’s Dan Pantaleo to stop choking him. Garner called out 11 times "I can't breathe," each cry with an intensity that made it not just difficult to witness but maddening. I yelled at the TV screen, shouting at the officers to let him go — trying to avoid seeing the inevitable. Garner died because law enforcement refused to see him as a human being who deserved a life. Refused to see him as a father. A husband. A son. A friend. A human being.
On Tuesday, the world learned that the officer, Pantaleo, would not face any federal charges in connection with the 2014 killing of Garner, and will likely be able to continue his career in the NYPD. Our justice system is still refusing to see Garner's life as one that was worth saving.
People and organizations stepped up to fight for Garner and his family. His daughter, Erica Garner, championed the crusade — #JusticeForEricGarner. She pushed a generation of us to show up for our loved ones. She endorsed Bernie Sanders, who eventually became a very outspoken supporter of the movement during the 2016 election cycle. She was even featured in one of his campaign videos.
She participated in Black Lives Matter protests, she led them, and she supported them. She promised she would fight for her father until he received justice or until she was in her grave. We all admired Erica. Many of us who didn’t know her father built a relationship with him through her work. When she passed away after a heart attack in 2017, we were all devastated. How could this powerful young woman who had been fighting for her father die so damn young? We knew her work would continue through so many people and organizations, and many of us hoped that Erica’s fight and her death would not be in vain.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
The news that Pantaleo would not be charged, while disturbing, is not surprising. We have seen time and time again that no matter how heinous the crime against black communities by law enforcement, the lack of accountability is steadfast. But the system was never meant to protect us, and while we should continue to make demands of district attorneys and the Department of Justice, we should also aim to overhaul and rebuild our justice system into one that no longer relies on a bloated police state that targets the black community.
An overhaul would allow us to imagine a world where Garner wouldn't have to sell "illegal cigarettes" to make ends meet. We could build a system in which Erica Garner wouldn't have to fight for her father's legacy and then die too young. All of our community needs would be met, and we would no longer be policed for being poor.
Working toward the overhaul of our current system should remind us that we all deserve to breathe. Eric Garner deserved to breathe. And we will continue to fight for his legacy and for his daughter's — legacies that centered on struggle and hope and justice.

We need to be greater than 'just OK'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life.
As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
The fact is, all the freedom those other countries enjoy would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs.
Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea— the idea of human liberty.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. Today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the light bulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity.
There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty. That is better than "just OK."

Years in politics give Pressley a leading voice in 'the Squad'

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — When the four Democratic congresswomen at the center of the racially charged feud with President Trump faced the cameras, one led them onto the stage and stepped to the microphones to speak first: Ayanna Pressley.
And after all four had made their statements at that Monday news conference and reporters started asking questions, Pressley's three colleagues in what they call “the Squad" — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib — turned their heads and looked to Pressley, who again stepped up to answer.
“We can sit here and continue to recycle his hateful rhetoric, of which I cannot feign surprise or inflated outrage because he is, if nothing else, predictable," Pressley said of Trump, urging Americans not to take his “bait." “What we are focused on are the hateful policies that are draconian and oppressive and life-threatening and family-separating that [are] being rolled out by this administration every day."
The Boston lawmaker is the most politically experienced of the four outspoken women of color who have shaken up the Democratic Party establishment since arriving in Washington six months ago with the new, diverse House majority. But so far, she's also been the least controversial.
Tlaib said they chose Pressley to speak first because she sets a “positive, loving tone." That was something they felt was needed after Trump declared they should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came." He also said they hate the United States.
“We wanted her to lead us in taking on the biggest bully probably in our lifetime," Tlaib said Tuesday in an interview.
Pressley, 45, is the oldest member of the Squad. She worked for former Massachusetts senator John Kerry for 13 years, including as his political director, before making history when she became the first African-American woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009. In 2018, Pressley stunned incumbent Representative Michael Capuano when she beat him in the Democratic primary.
In Boston, Pressley is known for championing women's and children issues as well as antiviolence causes. She has used her own personal story as a survivor of sexual assault to highlight that issue as well.
Pressley was elected to the City Council at a time when it was dominated by white men. During her time in office, other women of color were also elected. There are now six women on the 13-member council, including five women of color, one of whom is president.
“She was the tip of the iceberg that totally changed the Boston City Council," said Erin O'Brien, a political science professor at University of Massachusetts Boston who has followed Pressley's career.
On the council, Pressley did not have the controversial, outsider reputation she has now earned as part of the Squad. O'Brien said that could be because, as the only woman of color on the council earlier in her career, she did not want to jeopardize her seat.
“I don't think she had the option to throw bombs in the same way until she was surrounded by other like-minded individuals," O'Brien said.
Trump's comments this week come after the four first-term lawmakers have repeatedly criticized him on a range of issues during their short six months in office.
Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, with her huge social media following, is the constant lightning rod of the group with pointed critiques of Trump and his policies.
Omar, of Minnesota, has faced criticism — and charges of anti-Semitism — for her comments about Israel and its allies, suggesting, for example, that supporters of Israel were motivated by money. Tlaib caused outrage just hours after taking the oath of office for her profanity-laced call for Trump's impeachment. And Ocasio-Cortez suggested House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was singling out women of color when she upbraided them recently.
So far, by contrast, Pressley has not had a personal controversy of that level.
Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas said she was impressed that Pressley visited El Paso this month and spoke powerfully about the conditions for immigrant detainees there.
“She is such a powerful force for good," Escobar said about Pressley. “She is kind, generous, thoughtful. She's got the strength that I admire. So it just breaks my heart that because she wants to create a better country for all of us that she has to endure such abuse. But I know her strength, and I know she'll power through it."
But even as the House voted Tuesday to condemn Trump's comments, Democrats are still divided because of the internal struggle the squad has created by bucking the leadership of Pelosi. She publicly dismissed the four after they recently were the only four Democrats to oppose a bill to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.
“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world, but they didn't have any following. They are four people and that's how many votes they got," Pelosi told a New York Times columnist.
Barney Frank, a longtime Democratic representative from Massachusetts who retired in 2013, said the Squad's tactics are doing more harm than good to the progressive policies they want to advance. Yet, he said, Pressley seems different.
“My puzzlement about Pressley is that I haven't seen her do anything that seemed to me mistaken the way the other three have, but then she joins them, and apparently agrees with their approach, and I think their approach is very wrong," Frank said in an interview.
Part of the reason Pressley and the rest of the Squad might feel confident in their pushback against Pelosi is because the Democrats are in the majority, said Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers and an expert on Congress.
But Pelosi is focused on retaining the Democratic majority in the House, which means she needs to ensure that moderate Democrats are reelected. That probably means a more cautious political style.
“Pelosi sees the big picture, she understands what it means to be in the majority, and she also remembers, painfully, what it was like to be in the minority," Baker said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The House formally condemned President Donald Trump’s Twitter posts as racist on Tuesday – in a vote split largely along party lines despite pressure for Republicans to denounce the president’s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color that they should "go back" to where they came from.
The vote on the resolution condemning a series of Trump’s remarks and Twitter posts came after a dramatic and combative hours-long debate that hit several snags due to long-standing House rules that prohibit any personal attacks on the president.
The vote, 240-187, fell nearly entirely along party lines with only four Republicans voting with Democrats. The four Republicans lawmakers are: Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently left the GOP to become an independent, also voted in support of the resolution.
Nevada's Republican Rep. Mark Amodei released a statement after voting against the resolution:
“I have been consistent in my refusal to enter social media battles which are based largely on personalities. I didn’t do it when people were arguably critical of the Jewish faith or referred to the sitting President as a ‘MF-er’, and my refusal has been applied equally regardless of who the source of communication is.
"My energies and use of congressional resources will continue to focus on people’s health care, people’s immigration statuses, veterans, jobs, the economy, our troops, natural resources, and infrastructure, to name a few. Everyone have a nice day. ”
The resolution specifically called Trump's comments about "The Squad" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — "racist" and says the attacks have "legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color. "
Everything we know: Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad. '
Reparations bill: Calling racism the 'poison of America,' Schumer backs reparations bill
The vote put Republicans on the record as to whether they denounced the president's comments or stuck beside him. Throughout Tuesday's debates Democrats aimed to pressure Republicans to hold Trump accountable while Republicans resisted, denouncing the resolution as a political ploy.
The intense debate over the president's rhetoric led to the House halting proceedings for nearly two hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments “racist” and a top Republican asked her remarks be taken down.
"These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist," Pelosi said. "Every single member of this institution — Democratic and Republican — should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people. "
As Pelosi called the president’s tweets racist, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga. , tried to interrupt and cut off her speech. Pelosi only spoke louder, looking down at her prepared remarks.
After Pelosi was done, Collins looked wide-eyed at Pelosi and asked if she wanted to "rephrase that comment. " Pelosi shot back: "I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them. " House Democrats started cheering and clapping.
The move led to two hours of delay as officials debated over whether Pelosi violated House rules, which the House ruled she had. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. , who was presiding over the House floor at the time, abdicated his post due to the dramatic fighting on both sides.
"We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate. That’s what this is,” he said, noting that he tried to remain fair. But, he said. “fairness isn’t enough. We want to just fight. "
“I’ll abandon the chair,” Cleaver said, slamming the gavel on the dais and storming away as House officials watched in amazement.
The moment was replayed on loop on C-SPAN like a moment from an NFL game with reporters left with their jaws dropped remarking aloud whether this had happened before. A large crowd of journalists gathered in the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the debate.
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. , and chairman of the House Rules Committee, also got in a heated back-and-forth with Republicans after he attacked the president's comments in a speech as something that "used to be reserved for the darkest corners of the internet. "
"This is proudly using Twitter as a megaphone to attack fellow Americans," he said. "These are American citizens being turned into some kind of scary 'other,' not because of their party, but because of their background, their race and their opinions. "
He added: "I implore my colleagues to think twice before you follow the president off a cliff. "
Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga. , took issue with McGovern's comments, saying they clearly violated rules and were "diminishing" the institution of the House of Representatives.
Pelosi told members of her caucus Tuesday morning she wasn't worried about House rules on calling out the president's comments, describing the four congresswomen as their "sisters" and saying Trump's "words were racist," according to an aide in the room.
"The fact is, as offended as we are, and we are offended by what he said about our sisters. He says that about people every day and they feel as hurt as we do about somebody in our family having this offense against them," Pelosi said, according to the source.
More on resolution: House resolution will condemn Trump's 'disgusting' attacks on AOC, Tlaib, Omar and Pressley
Trump should 'aim higher': Lindsey Graham and other Republicans respond to Trump's 'go back' tweets
She added that she hoped Republicans would join them in condemning the comments by voting in a bipartisan fashion for the resolution.
"If they can’t support condemning the words of the President, well that’s a message in and of itself," Pelosi said.
Most Republicans did not condemn the president and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate refused to do so Tuesday morning, alleging the outcry is over politics.
“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” said GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy. “This is all about politics and beliefs of ideologies. "
Along with the resolution, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn. , introduced a measure that would censure Trump for his racist comments. Democrats aren't expected to take up the measure for a vote, instead hoping the resolution on Tuesday would garner bipartisan support.
Trump wrote on Sunday that it was "so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe" now telling the U. S. how to run its government. He did not mention Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley or Tlaib by name.
"Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came," Trump wrote on Twitter. "Then come back and show us how it is done. "
All four are American citizens. The four progressive freshmen lawmakers are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as "The Squad" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.
The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.
The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of "The Squad," telling New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the four congresswomen "have their public whatever and their Twitter world" but do not "have any following. "
Ocasio-Cortez questioned why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was "outright disrespectful. "
The back-and-forth digs ended over the weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.

The resolution not only condemns Trump's comments. It also highlights immigration as a centerpiece of American history and culture, quoting presidents throughout history and comparing them to the policies of the Trump administration, which has been heavily scrutinized due in part to the worsening conditions in migrant detention centers at the southern U. S. border.
"The commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents," the resolution reads. "American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good.

Main Street: Democrats Smear Democrats

Texto completo: For a moment there, Nancy Pelosi looked lost. After Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) accused her of "singling out . . . newly elected women of color" for criticism, it fell to Donald Trump to defend the speaker of the House. To call Mrs. Pelosi a racist, Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, "is a disgrace."
Not exactly the rescue she was hoping for. Fortunately for her, by Sunday Mr. Trump had followed up with a series of tweets saying the progressive Democratic congresswomen accusing Mrs. Pelosi of racism should go back to the countries whence they came, fix the problems there, and then return to America to teach us what to do. That gave Mrs. Pelosi the opening she needed to get back on the familiar ground of attacking Mr. Trump as racist and xenophobic.
Even so, Mrs. Pelosi must know the newfound party unity over mutual denunciation of the president won't last. Because the larger, emerging story of 2020 is Democrat-on-Democrat infighting as progressives accuse moderates of racism. Saul Alinsky would recognize it as forcing targets to live by their own rules.
The most notable strike came on the second night of the Democratic presidential debates, when Sen. Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) accused Joe Biden of having been too cozy with segregationists (also Democrats) who were still around during Mr. Biden's early years in the Senate, and working with them "to oppose busing."
It's nonsense, of course, to imply that a man who loyally served as vice president for the first African-American president is a racist. Ditto for the accusation against Mrs. Pelosi. As Maureen Dowd aptly put it in the New York Times, "A.O.C. should consider the possibility that people who disagree with her do not disagree with her color."
It's good to read about how vile and unfair it is to assume people who have a different point of view must be motivated by racial animosity. But it's illuminating that we're only hearing this outrage now because the target of these Democratic accusations of racism are other Democrats.
The way things are going, by the end of the campaign, few of the Democratic presidential aspirants will emerge unscathed. Take Pete Buttigieg. After a white South Bend, Ind., police officer shot and killed an African American wielding a knife, the mayor was asked at a contentious South Bend rally if he is a "racist" and if he believes "black lives matter."
Meanwhile, an African-American radio host recently asked Elizabeth Warren about her claims to be Native American, calling her "the original Rachel Dolezal," a "white woman pretending to be black." Even Ms. Harris has herself been accused by a writer for TheRoot.com of having "spent her whole career as a prosecutor locking up black men in California." And right before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez accused Mrs. Pelosi of criticizing women because of their color and not their politics, her chief of staff tweeted (then deleted) that Democratic moderates "certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s."
On the substance, almost all these accusations of racial animosity -- against Mr. Biden, against Mrs. Pelosi, against Mr. Buttigieg, against moderate Democrats -- are false and repellent. Yet in another sense, there's a certain rough justice that these Democrats today find themselves having to defend themselves against these accusations.
Not because they are racist. But because so many have played the same vile card against equally guiltless Republicans and conservatives.
Start with Mrs. Pelosi. Only days before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez played the race card on her, Mrs. Pelosi declared that the "Make America Great Again" hat was really all about making America "white again." Got that? The MAGA hat is itself racist, as presumably is everyone who wears it. Now she's hoping to drown out her intraparty feud with an upstart progressive wing by seeing who can shout the loudest that the president is a racist.
As for Mr. Biden, he's understandably outraged by how he's been painted as a segregationist sympathizer. But back when he and Barack Obama were running against Republican Mitt Romney, Mr. Biden told a largely African-American audience that Mr. Romney was "going to put y'all back in chains."
It isn't the only time he's pulled this card from the bottom of the deck. A year ago, Mr. Biden appeared on MSNBC with the Rev. Al Sharpton to say there is only one reason Republicans support voter-identification laws: "They don't want black folks voting."
Come to think of it, there's Mr. Sharpton himself. Over the years, without any apologies, one of the greatest race-baiters of all time has managed to transform himself into a Democratic Party elder statesman. To the point where almost all the party's top contenders dutifully have made the pilgrimage to kiss his ring.
So, yes, both Mr. Biden and Mrs. Pelosi have been falsely accused of racism. Then again, they are also both reaping what they have sown.

Trump Administration Warns of Threats With Cryptocurrencies

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that he has "very serious concerns" about cryptocurrencies, including the one being developed by Facebook, the latest indication that Washington is preparing to exert its power over digital currencies.
In a briefing at the White House, Mr. Mnuchin said cryptocurrencies pose a national security threat because they can be used to fund illicit activities. He also said that the Trump administration was "not comfortable" with Facebook's plans to begin a digital payment system, called Libra.
The warnings come after similar comments by President Trump, who said in a series of Twitter posts last week that he was "not a fan" of cryptocurrencies and that their value was volatile and "based on thin air." Mr. Trump warned Facebook that it must seek a banking charter and follow all bank regulations if it wants to be in the digital currency business.
The Trump administration has said little about cryptocurrencies in the past two years, despite their growing popularity. Mr. Mnuchin has largely described the new technology for creating, moving and storing money as a potential consumer protection issue rather than a threat to the financial system. Regulators have long focused on how to minimize crime in the cryptocurrency industry, but it has tended to be a wonky issue that has not attracted much public attention.
But Facebook's announcement of Libra has spurred Washington's interest in cryptocurrencies.
The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, said last week that the central bank had "serious concerns" about Libra and had been in contact with Facebook regarding its project.
This week, the House and Senate will hold hearings to examine Libra, and lawmakers plan to grill David Marcus, the Facebook executive who is overseeing the project. Facebook was asked to cease work on the project until it addresses lawmakers' concerns.
Facebook's crypto foray has renewed attention on the thousands of cryptocurrencies that flourished after the original digital currency, Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 and envisioned as a new kind of money that would not be controlled by any government or central authority.
Bitcoin was presented by its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a largely political project, aimed at challenging central banks and governments.
But from the early days, Bitcoin gained traction among people looking to make illegal transactions online. The Silk Road, an online market for illegal drugs, was started in 2011 and became a booming business, with every payment sent in Bitcoin.
In recent years, there have been many legitimate businesses set up around cryptocurrencies. Most of these businesses are focused on using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as investment products, similar to gold.
Several large financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Fidelity, have begun to offer products related to Bitcoin to their customers.
This mainstream validation has helped give Bitcoin a sheen of legitimacy and pushed up the price of the digital token. But it has also led to increased volatility in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The price of a single Bitcoin soared to nearly $ 20,000 in early 2018. Since then, it crashed to $ 3,000, but has risen swiftly again in recent months to around $ 12,000.
Bitcoin has also become the standard currency for ransomware operations in which victims lose control of their computer to remote hackers. Victims are able to get back their files only if they send a Bitcoin payment. Many cities have lost control of their computer networks in these kinds of attacks.
On Monday, Mr. Mnuchin cited the use of Bitcoin in terrorist financing, tax evasion and human trafficking, though so far, law enforcement officials have brought few cases in those areas.
"The Treasury Department has expressed very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financiers," he said, adding that "we will not tolerate the use of the cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities."
Facebook does not intend to release the currency until next year, but the company has big ambitions for the project, which it hopes will become a new global currency and the foundation for an alternative global financial system.
Those ambitions -- and Facebook's broader reputational problems -- have made the project such a lightning rod for controversy.
"We know we need to take the time to get this right," Mr. Marcus, the Facebook executive, said in testimony released ahead of the Senate Banking Committee hearing. "And I want to be clear: Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals."
Facebook has designed Libra so that it will be run by a Swiss association governed by at least a hundred companies and other partners, rather than just Facebook itself.
When Facebook announced Libra, it said it already had 27 partners, including big players like Uber, Mastercard, Visa and Spotify. But so far those partners have largely remained silent and Facebook has borne the brunt of the scrutiny facing Libra.
It is clear that Facebook will be facing a raft of new regulations and public scrutiny as it proceeds.
Mr. Mnuchin said that cryptocurrencies must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. They must also meet the same anti-money laundering and counterfeiting standards as traditional financial firms.
The Treasury secretary also expressed concerns about the speculative nature of Bitcoin and about Facebook's problems protecting the privacy of its users.
"Our overriding goal is to maintain the integrity of our financial system and protect it from abuse," Mr. Mnuchin said.
The Trump administration's concerns about Libra appear to be bound up in the president's broader distrust of the social networking giant. Mr. Trump tweeted about Libra soon after a social media summit meeting in which he criticized Facebook and other big tech companies, accusing them of silencing conservative voices, including his.
Mr. Mnuchin insisted the administration was not trying to retaliate against Facebook. "No, we're not going to target any one entity," he said. "Everybody is playing by the same rules."
Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, expressed similar concerns about Libra last week, telling lawmakers it could not go forward "without their being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering, all those things." He also raised data privacy and consumer protection concerns, saying, "All of those things will need to be addressed very thoroughly, and carefully, in a deliberate process that will not be a sprint to implementation."
Skepticism about Libra, and cryptocurrencies more broadly, represent a rare issue where the Trump administration and some Democrats are united. Last week, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, called on the Fed to protect consumers from Facebook's "Monopoly money."
"The largest banks and the largest tech companies do not act in the interest of working Americans, but in the interest of themselves and their investors," Mr. Brown said. "The Fed must take a proactive role to ensure that the payments system remains accountable to the public."
However, Republicans have tended to be more sympathetic to the cryptocurrency industry, and have positioned it as something that the government should be working to protect as a check against government and corporate power.
Just this week, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, argued in a New York Times op-ed article that cryptocurrencies and the networks they create could provide an answer to the privacy scandals facing the internet giants.
Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin in the past.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Joe Biden's healthcare plan would be Obamacare on steroids

Texto completo: Joe Biden on Monday outlined a healthcare proposal that, while less disruptive than rival plans to socialize the U.S. health insurance system, would still dramatically increase the price tag of Obamacare and likely erode employer insurance.
In his campaign for president, Biden has sought to counter calls to cancel private insurance for 180 million people by portraying himself as a protector of his old boss's legacy who was eager to build off Obamacare.
What he proposed would, in several ways, greatly increase the cost of Obamacare -- which itself increased federal spending on healthcare by about $2 trillion over a decade.
The biggest feature of Biden's proposal is the introduction of a new government-run plan to be offered on the exchanges. There are some big questions I'd have about how this would interact with employer-based coverage that I would get to below, but first, I'd want to look at several ways that Biden's plan would increase costs.
Biden aims to make Obamacare's coverage more generous in several ways.
He wants to increase the subsidies to purchase insurance on Obamacare's exchanges. Instead of limiting subsidies to those who earn above about $50,000 for individuals, Biden would set a cap that would limit the cost of premiums to 8.5% of a person's income, so people earning above the current Obamacare cutoff could now qualify for assistance.
Additionally, under Obamacare, the subsidies are pegged to the cost of a midlevel "silver" plan. This was done in an effort to contain costs by asking people to pay more if they wanted more generous coverage. Steering individuals toward plans with relatively higher deductibles and co-payments was also a way of discouraging overuse of the system. But Biden's plan would peg subsidies to "gold" coverage with lower deductibles. This will both increase the cost of subsidies to the government and the use of healthcare.
Biden also plans to offer the new government-run plan as an option to 4.9 million Medicaid-eligible individuals living in the 14 states that did not participate in Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.
To be sure, Biden does offer some cost-containment suggestions, but they all come with complications and limitations.
His plan promises that, "As in Medicare, the Biden public option will reduce costs for patients by negotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers." But the greater extent to which the government uses power to drive down payment rates, the more difficult it would make it for doctors and hospitals to earn money, causing many of them to fail. Coupled with the increased demand for medical services that would result from expanding insurance and making it more generous, this threatens to create significant access problems.
Another provision would allow Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices. But the CBO has in the past said that negotiation would produce "little, if any" savings. Margot Sanger-Katz of the New York Times has helpfully explained that it's difficult to drive down drug prices through negotiation when Medicare does not realistically have the ability to walk away.
Beyond the cost issues, the Biden plan leaves a lot of key details out of its explanation of the government option, specifically how it would interact with employer insurance. Right now, nearly half the population, or about 157 million people, receive coverage through their employers that they are generally happy with. Biden promises, "If your insurance company isn’t doing right by you, you should have another, better choice. Whether you’re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, the Biden Plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare."
This language suggests that everybody would have the ability to purchase the new government option, regardless of how they get their insurance. This would be significant.
Under Obamacare, larger employers (or those with more than 50 employees) cannot purchase insurance for their employers on the exchanges. And individuals who are offered employer insurance and want to purchase insurance through the exchanges face significant limitations. First, if they decline employer coverage, then they would not receive money toward health benefits from their employer. Second, they would be very unlikely to qualify for Obamacare subsidies, even if they would otherwise qualify based on income. As healthcare.gov explains, "If you have an offer of job-based insurance, the only way you’ll qualify for savings on a Marketplace plan is if your employer’s insurance offer doesn’t meet minimum standards for affordability and coverage. Most job-based plans meet these standards."
If Biden wants to offer everybody with an offer of employer coverage the ability to purchase insurance through the exchange, it raises a number of questions. Would those people also be able to choose among private plans, or just the government option? Would people who declined employer coverage now be entitled to government subsidies? In that case, the government would now be incurring costs that would otherwise have been born by employers, something that could be described as a massive subsidy for large corporations. If, on the other hand, Biden imposes the same restrictions on workers with an offer of coverage going on the exchanges as Obamacare does currently, then he can't really argue that the government plan is open to everybody.
Furthermore, if the government subsidies are large enough to attract enough workers, employers could decide that it's no longer worth offering employer coverage. That would mean many people who prefer their current employer plans would end up losing them anyway, despite Biden's promises that they would be able to keep their coverage.
One other aspect of this that remains unclear is how setting subsidies based on the price of gold-level plans would interact with enrollment in the government-run option. People might decide that if they can now afford a gold-level private plan with the new subsidy structure, there would be no need to settle for a government-run option.
Finally, Biden suggests he would pay for the plan through increasing long-term capital gains tax on wealthier Americans and repealing the Trump tax cuts. However, these proposals would not generate as much as he seems to indicate. As the Tax Policy Center noted at the time Republicans were debating their tax bill in 2017, "taxpayers can always avoid paying capital gains tax by simply not selling their assets. For that reason, a higher long-term maximum capital gains tax rate may not generate much additional revenue. TPC estimates that raising the 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains to 25% would generate less than $25 billion from 2018 through 2027."
Also, the Trump tax cuts were front-loaded, and by the time the next president takes office, the bulk of the tax relief will have been delivered. Key provisions on the individual income side are already scheduled to expire after 2025, and on the corporate side, full expensing will start to phase out in 2022. All of those phaseouts are already included in the CBO baseline, so even a full repeal of the Trump tax cuts wouldn't generate as much additional revenue as people expect, and to the extent that Democrats decide to preserve the middle-class tax relief in the law, any partial repeal would raise even less.
So, Biden's plan would certainly be less costly and disruptive than a $32 trillion proposal requiring all Americans to enroll in a single government plan that would cancel private insurance for 180 million people. But it would still be extraordinarily expensive and disruptive. Story URLPhoto Caption:Vice President Joe Biden is proud of the National Park Service ranger who stood up to Rep.

Texto completo: El domingo, el presidente Donald J. Trump conminó a congresistas demócratas progresistas a regresar “a los países infestados de crimen de donde vinieron”. Aunque Trump no las nombra, se refería a las cuatro congresistas electas en los comicios intermedios de 2018: Alexandria Ocasio Cortés, nacida en Nueva York y de ascendencia puertorriqueña; Ayana Pressley, de Massachusetts; Ilhan Omar, de Minnesota; y Rashida Tlaib, de Michigan. Solo Omar es inmigrante y llegó aquí como refugiada de Somalia a los 10 años de edad. Es ciudadana estadounidense.
Es obvio que para Trump ser estadounidense equivale a ser blanco. Y es esa premisa la que mueve su estrategia de campaña, ahora de reelección, así como su estrategia política y sus decisiones de política pública, especialmente en materia migratoria. De hecho, Trump lleva semanas anunciando el inicio de redadas en varias ciudades del país para detener a inmigrantes con órdenes finales de deportación, acción que para Trump es un capítulo más del reality show que es su presidencia, para infligir terror entre la comunidad inmigrante y demostrar ante sus seguidores que está cumpliéndoles lo prometido. De hecho, para garantizarles que su plan de promover división guiará su campaña de reelección.
No hay que olvidar que fue Trump quien encabezó la campaña que cuestionó la ciudadanía estadounidense del expresidente Barack Obama afirmando que había nacido en Kenia, como su padre, y no en Hawaii.
Trump no dudó en atacar a un senador federal, luego candidato y luego presidente estadounidense, abogado constitucionalista egresado de Harvard y nacido en Hawaii de madre estadounidense y padre africano. El domingo afirmó que las congresistas demócratas progresistas deben “regresar” a los países de “donde vinieron”, aunque ese país sea Estados Unidos. “Regrésate a tu país” es la frase preferida de los prejuiciosos, y muchos hemos sido el objetivo, sobre todo al hablar español en público, aunque seamos ciudadanos estadounidenses. ¿Qué pueden esperar entonces los inmigrantes al interior del país y los migrantes que arriban a la frontera o que ya están detenidos y hacinados en condiciones infrahumanas?
Si su gobierno ni siquiera tiene compasión con niños y bebés migrantes detenidos en insalubres condiciones documentadas por el Inspector General del propio Departamento de Seguridad Interna (DHS), ¿hay quien todavía ponga en duda que el único objetivo de Trump es explotar políticamente la divisiva estrategia de “ellos contra nosotros” cimentada en el nativismo, el prejuicio y el racismo?
Y claro está, sus cómplices le siguen el juego. Solo hay que remitirse a la visita del vicepresidente Mike Pence a la frontera el pasado viernes. Mientras las cámaras de la prensa que cubre al vicepresidente mostraron las terribles condiciones de hacinamiento e insalubridad y los propios reporteros indicaron que la pestilencia era abrumadora y que incluso algunos agentes portaban máscaras debido al mal olor, Pence trató de minimizar las condiciones y, claro está, culpó a los demócratas por la falta de fondos para abordar la crisis. Incluso tachó de “deshonesto” un video de CNN del hacinamiento.
Solo había que ver el rostro de Pence al observar a los migrantes enjaulados. Parecía que quería salir corriendo. Pero tenía que completar la visita para hacer creer que hay compasión, cuando en realidad Trump está utilizando la crisis humanitaria con fines electorales. La imagen de rostros morenos hacinados le sirve a Trump en sus planes de promover miedo y prejuicio entre sus huestes.
Que Trump lo haga, a nadie sorprende, pero la hipocresía del evangélico Pence es indignante aunque no sorprendente. La prensa reportó que Pence también visitó un centro de detención de niños migrantes acompañado de su esposa y de tres senadores republicanos, Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur; Mike Lee, de Utah, y John Cornyn, de Texas.
The New York Times reportó que Lee le sirvió de intérprete a Pence, quien les preguntó si tenían comida y cuidados, a lo que los niños respondieron que sí. “Pero cuando les preguntó si tenían un lugar para asearse”, los niños movieron la cabeza en señal de no, según el diario.
“Dos niños le dijeron al Señor Pence que habían caminado por dos o tres meses para llegar a Estados Unidos, a lo que Pence respondió en inglés ‘God bless you’, y ‘gracias’ en español”, reportó The New York Times.
Me pregunto dónde Pence esconde su Biblia y los preceptos religiosos que tanto defiende, cuando le hace el trabajo sucio a Trump. Pence cumplió su cometido y dio la espalda al problema.
Pero el daño infligido, sobre todo el daño psicológico a los niños, ya está hecho.
Porque si algo ha demostrado Trump y su gobierno es que la crueldad y el prejuicio no tienen límites, así se trate de niños, o de expresidentes, o de congresistas que no llenen el molde racial que el presidente defiende. La estrategia electoral del “ellos (los de color) contra nosotros (los blancos)”, sigue vivita y coleando en los planes de reelección de Trump.

Hong Kong Activist Lauds Trump 'Hardball' on China Trade; Billionaire Jimmy Lai says Beijing needs a deal.

Texto completo: Hong Kong media magnate and democracy champion Jimmy Lai thinks that President Donald Trump is wise to "play hardball" with China's ruling communists on trade because "that's the only thing they understand." But Mr. Lai is also urging the U.S. to "show humility" and allow China an opportunity to save face in striking a new deal.
Mr. Trump "knows what he's doing," says Mr. Lai, adding: "He's a bit crazy, but it's genius crazy." Mr. Lai is in the U.S. seeking help to preserve and advance liberty in Hong Kong as the Chinese regime has been trying to reduce the autonomy of the island territory.
During a visit to the Journal this morning Mr. Lai described the trade dispute with the U.S. as a "crisis" for China and said that the Beijing regime needs to cut a deal to reduce tariffs. Hours earlier, the release of official quarterly economic data suggested that China's government has a strong incentive to come to terms with the U.S. The Journal's Chao Deng shared the news from Beijing:
China's economic growth decelerated to its slowest pace in decades, weakened by trade tensions with the U.S. and businesses that held back from making big investments despite encouragement from Beijing.
The economy grew by 6.2% in the second quarter, down from 6.4% in the period before, official statistics showed Monday. Growth was slower than the 6.3% year-over-year rate forecast by economists.
Of course U.S. workers would love to have growth anywhere near 6%, but for China it was the worst quarter since 1992. And in the New York Times, Keith Bradsher suggests that the period ended a lot worse than it started:
... much of the growth in the quarter may have taken place in April and early May, when public confidence was higher because of a tax cut in March and heavy infrastructure spending as spring began. Trade talks broke down on May 10 and President Trump raised tariffs sharply on Chinese goods, a step that damaged consumer confidence within China. Growth early in the quarter also would have taken place before the contentious government takeover of a bank in late May hurt financial confidence.
Chinese officials on Monday acknowledged that conditions are becoming increasingly difficult.
... Monthly economic data, particularly for imports, suggests that the second quarter started strong but then slowed. "There was certainly a surge in activity through April," said George Magnus, a longtime specialist in the Chinese economy who is now at Oxford University. "Something happened in May."
Something is clearly happening among American executives who have been doing business in China. Over the weekend, the Journal's Austen Hufford and Bob Tita reported :
U.S. manufacturers are shifting production to countries outside of China as trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies stretch into a second year.
Companies that make Crocs shoes, Yeti beer coolers, Roomba vacuums and GoPro cameras are producing goods in other countries to avoid U.S. tariffs of as much as 25% on some $250 billion of imports from China. Apple Inc. also is considering shifting final assembly of some of its devices out of China to avoid U.S. tariffs.
Furniture-maker Lovesac Co. is making about 60% of its furniture in China, down from 75% at the start of the year. "We have been shifting production to Vietnam very aggressively," said Shawn Nelson, chief executive of the Stamford, Conn., company. Mr. Nelson said he plans to have no production in China by the end of next year... "Once you move, you don't go back," Mr. Nelson said.
Of course moving supply chains in response to new tariffs imposed by Washington is hardly cost-free for the U.S. The consensus among professional economists is for a lousy report of slow GDP growth in the U.S. for the second quarter. If the American economy doesn't accelerate, Mr. Trump can expect a rough reckoning at the polls in November of 2020.
But how much time does Chinese strongman Xi Jinping have to fix his trading relationship with the U.S.? His regime doesn't allow free elections, but that doesn't mean he can't be relieved of command. A month ago the Journal's Jillian Melchior interviewed Mr. Lai in Hong Kong:
Mr. Lai believes Mr. Xi is more vulnerable than he looks. Since 1949 the Chinese Communist Party has been a game of thrones, with the toughest political operators prevailing. But Mr. Xi abolished presidential term limits, concentrating power like no leader since Mao. Mr. Lai likens him to a king or emperor presiding over a feudal system: "The government becomes a court government, the same as in the old times." That makes enemies of those shut out of power: "Whenever they see opportunity, they will fight back."
Mr. Lai describes Mr. Xi as "definitely a hard-core Communist" who looks especially strong because technology gives him "a power of controlling the people unprecedented in human history." China is creating a surveillance state, using high-tech to track faces, movement and associations.
But Mr. Lai believes Mr. Xi is overreaching: "When you have concentrated all the power on yourself, you're also concentrating all the responsibility on yourself. Every mistake becomes your mistake. When you have shared power, you have shared responsibility." Mr. Lai doesn't rule out an internal coup because Mr. Xi is holding "an impossible job."
Holding on to his job may indeed prove impossible for Mr. Xi if he can't keep global manufacturers in China.

MORNING BRIEFING; Secret's out: Goal is equal pay

Texto completo: Procter & Gamble, which supports U.S. Soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, says it will donate $529,000 -- $23,000 for each of the 23 players on the U.S. team that won the Women's World Cup --to help close the pay gap between the women's and men's teams. The sponsor took out a full-page ad in the New York Times on Sunday urging the U.S. Soccer Federation to "be on the right side of history."
The ad begins, "23 is the number of players on one champion team: women's or men's."
"23 pairs of chromosomes make up one winning athlete: female or male."

"23 is a prime, whole number. It can never be divided. 23 is the number of strength."
It goes on to say, "But after all the toasts, cheers, parades and awards subside, the issue remains. Inequality is about more than pay and players, it's about values. Let's take this moment of celebration to propel women's sports forward. We urge the U.S. Soccer Federation to be a beacon of strength and end gender pay inequality once and for all."
In March, 28 members of the U.S. women's national team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation. The suit claims the USSF pays the women less than members of the men's national team.
According to the lawsuit, "The pay for advancement through the rounds of the World Cup was so skewed that, in 2014, the USSF provided the MNT with performance bonuses totaling $5,375,000 for losing in the Round of 16, while, in 2015, the USSF provided the WNT with only $1,725,000 for winning the entire tournament. The WNT earned more than three times less than the MNT while performing demonstrably better."
Members of the U.S. women's national team are set to earn roughly $250,000 each for winning the 2019 Women's World Cup.
Not him again
Cleveland's Trevor Bauer is an elite pitcher who finished sixth in the Cy Young Award voting last season and has struck out 160 batters in 138 innings this season. But Minnesota's Max Kepler has his number.
On June 6, Kepler homered in each of his three at-bats against Bauer in Minnesota's 5-4 victory. He didn't face Bauer again until Saturday. Kepler homered off him to lead off the game. Then he homered off him again in the second inning.
So, in five at-bats against Bauer, Kepler hit five homers.
"It's unfathomable that it is happening in front of our eyes," Twins manager Rocco Baldelli told MLB.com after the game. "I was going to say that I don't think any of us had seen anything like it. Come to find out, nobody has seen anything like it."
Kepler is only the third player since 1961 to hit five straight homers off one pitcher, joining Carlos Delgado (off Jorge Sosa in 2003-04) and Frank Howard (off Bob Hendley in 1963-64).
"In situations like that, there's nothing I'm going to really be able to do; he's just locked in against me for whatever reason," Bauer said. "Sometimes, guys are just hot and it doesn't matter what you do to them, they're going to hit it. And he's hot off me right now. It won't be that way forever."
Kepler's streak ended later that same game when he struck out against Bauer.
Time to bench the guy.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
KINKY BOOTS Stream on BroadwayHD. Lola, the cabaret drag artist at the center of this smash musical, has only been absent from Broadway for a few months. (The Broadway run of the show ended in April.) But those already feeling separation anxiety can take comfort in the presence of this filmed version, captured last year at the Adelphi Theater in London's West End. While many have strutted with the boots since the show debuted in Chicago in 2012, this version stars Matt Henry as Lola, a role for which he won an Olivier Award. Killian Donnelly stars opposite him, as the struggling shoe factory owner Charlie. Both performers were part of the original London cast. The show is "a shameless emotional button pusher, presided over -- be warned -- by that most weary of latter-day Broadway archetypes, a strong and sassy drag queen who dispenses life lessons like an automated fortune cookie," Ben Brantley wrote in his review of the Broadway production for The New York Times in 2013. "Yet, for a good while, 'Kinky Boots' manages to ride over the skeptical grumbling of your conscious mind."
CITIES OF LAST THINGS (2019) Stream on Netflix. This noir from the Malaysian-born, Taiwan-based director Wi Ding Ho begins in the future, at the finale of its story, and ends in the past. And so it begins the way many stories end: with a death. The three episodes that follow that death, told in reverse chronological order, shed light on the life of a cop, Dong-ling, who is played by three actors: Jack Kao ("Millennium Mambo"), Lee Hong-chi and Xie Zhang-ying. "As the full picture comes into focus, the narrative can tend toward the trite," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times. "The chief pleasure of the movie is the 35-millimeter cinematography of Jean Louis Vialard, who shoots mainly at night, taking wonderful advantage of the ways the light plays across city streets."
COMICSTAAN Stream on Amazon. Stand-up comedy specials and reality competition shows generally have limited overlap -- unless you're talking about this Indian series. Now in its second season, the show gathers a group of fresh comedy talent and has them compete to out-funny each other.
What's on TV
SPECTRE (2015) 4:50 p.m. on FXM. Daniel Craig is pitted against a supervillain played by Christoph Waltz in this most recent James Bond movie, which might be best remembered for its opening sequence shot largely in a singly arty take -- a flourish from the director Sam Mendes. This was Mendes and Craig's second Bond collaboration, and "they're a reasonable fit," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Although their joint seriousness has started to feel more reflexive than honest, especially because every Bond movie inevitably shakes off ambition to get down to the blockbuster business of hurling everything -- bodies, bullets, fireballs, debris, money -- at the screen." Dargis also wrote that she was still pining for Sean Connery's take on Bond. For a shot of that, see NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN at 9 p.m. on Starz Encore.

Texto completo: In May 2015, Christie's sold Pablo Picasso's "Women of Algiers" for $ 179.4 million, the highest price for a painting at auction up to that point. Two and a half years later, Christie's sold Leonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi," a portrait of Christ, for $ 450.3 million. In his new book, "The Last Leonardo," the author and documentary filmmaker Ben Lewis writes about the painting's twisty, contentious road to the auction block and beyond.
"Salvator Mundi," Lewis writes, is "poised between the medieval and the modern, an image that opens the door to the new world, just as Leonardo himself did." But it remains the subject of controversy, its whereabouts unclear and its authorship still disputed. "It has become a victim of the secrecy upon which the unregulated art market, and around it the 21st-century globalized economy, is built," Lewis writes. Below, the author talks about how writing this book was a dream job, the surprise of telling a previous owner of the painting about its ultimate fate, and more.
When did you first get the idea to write this book?
After the painting sold, in November 2017. I thought this was the most amazing adventure story a painting had ever gone through -- the history of it, this 500-year purported history. It's been in palaces and penthouses, and you'd expect that. But it also spent 50 years in American suburbia.
And we're really not sure about its history. There are incredible blanks, and a lot of subterfuge. No painting I ever read about or studied -- and I've done quite a bit of art history -- has had so many ups and downs. Like Jeff Bridges says in "The Big Lebowski," "There's a lot of ins and a lot of outs."
Normally my agent is really tough on me: "No one's going to want to read that"; "that's not a book, that's a documentary." This time, 20 minutes after I sent the idea, she called me up and said, "This is big."
What's the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?
Without doubt, the most surprising thing was finding Basil "Tookie" Hendry Jr., the person who inherited the painting and consigned it to auction in New Orleans in 2005 and sold it for $ 1,175, and learning that he had no idea -- absolutely no idea -- when I contacted him in 2018 that his picture was now considered to be by Leonardo and had sold for $ 450 million at Christie's. That's the most surprising thing I've ever discovered in my whole life. I couldn't believe it -- and neither could he, when I told him.
He ran a construction business and did not read the culture pages of newspapers. He had no particular interest in art; he just wanted to offload these pictures to the benefit of him and his family.
We weren't sure if he had owned it. I had tracked down the very obscure auction house catalog. On the cover of the catalog, there was a list of names. The owner could have been any of the names, or none of them. One of them was Trent Reznor. I thought, "Trent is a goth, or was; this is the kind of picture he might buy." How good would that be for my book? But it wasn't him.
It took me and a colleague five or six months to track down Hendry. When we rang him up, we had no idea whether he had owned this picture or not. He said, "Oh yeah, we did have one of those hanging in the stairwell."
In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?
I wrote the book I set out to write. I wanted to write an art history book that wasn't an art history book. I wanted to write a thriller about a heist -- I don't mean that in a negative way. But two dealers find this painting and pay a thousand dollars for it, and 12 years later it's worth $ 450 million. That's a Guy Ritchie film. Or "Point Break."
The story had this classic skeleton, and I could weave in Leonardo's bio, slightly revisionist, and I could also mount an investigation: Was it a Leonardo or not? Here is this old master painting, which tells you everything you need to know about the history of art and the art market and what art has become. I don't have to give you lots of generalizations about it, all I have to do is tell the story of this painting, fact by fact, and the readers will get it all and make up their own minds.
Every day, I felt like, this is my dream job. This is the best project and subject I'll ever have. It was difficult to write. Just because I knew what I wanted to do from day one didn't mean it was easy.
Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?
Max Beckmann, the wonderful German Expressionist. His busy themes of life in Berlin in the first half of the 20th century had a huge impact on me at the age of 17, when I was working at an auction house in Munich. There was a Max Beckmann exhibition on, and there was something about his vision of the world -- dense and chaotic, but also exuberant.
And I have to mention one writer. Italo Calvino is my hero. I read "Invisible Cities" every year. There's a quote from it in the beginning of my book.
Persuade someone to read "The Last Leonardo" in 50 words or less.
It's the greatest story of survival in the history of art. It's basically an art history version of "The Revenant" -- not with Leonardo DiCaprio, but with Leonardo da Vinci. It's a historical costume drama, a thriller and a detective story all rolled into one.

Texto completo: Here at Washington Post Food HQ, we're used to questions about substitutions and recipe changes. One of the most common ingredients that trips people up is cilantro.
"This is one herb you either like or dislike - there seems to be no middle road, writes British author, grower and gardening expert Jekka McVicar in her book, "Jekka's Herb Cookbook.
To say people dislike cilantro seems like one of those charming English understatements, because often the sentiment that arises is more like loathing. "Has A Nation Taken Leaf of Its Senses? screamed an over-the-top Washington Post article from 1994, in which author Elizabeth Kastor calls cilantro "an affront that "tastes like the grief you feel over the public humiliation of a favorite teacher who was found drinking in the language lab.
OK then!
Often, however, people describe the taste of cilantro as soapy. As Harold McGee explained in the New York Times some years back, that comparison makes sense given that cilantro's aroma shares some of its flavor substances with soap.
McVicar also mentions the scent "is said to resemble a crushed bedbug, which was a new one for me (shudder). Then again, McGee cites the Oxford Companion to Food when he explains that the word coriander, another name for cilantro, "is said to derive from the Greek word for bedbug. Anyway, whether that soapy/bug taste is the result of some kind of genetic factor or merely a result of your environment (cilantro is a lot more integral to some cuisines than others) is almost beside the point when someone who can't stand it is confronted by it.
"It's one of those flavors you can distinctly pick out of any dish, says Bill Williamson, executive chef at Washington's BLT Prime, who admits to being able to tolerate cilantro only some of the time. Given his job, he's used to working around people who claim a sensitivity or allergy to the herb. Here's some advice from him and others if you're in the same boat.
Leave it off.
Honestly, it's sometimes as simple as that. If the recipe is merely using cilantro as a garnish, you're not going to make or break the dish by skipping it. Or set aside a separate bowl to let your guests add as much or as little of it as they want to.
Make a substitution.
At the restaurant, Williamson says, the kitchen often swaps in a mix of parsley, tarragon and dill for cilantro. And because cilantro lends a bright, citrusy pop of flavor, lime or lemon zest is another option. He also likes carrot tops. "It's kind of a warm, earthy, sweeter spicy flavor, he says of the greens, which can otherwise go to waste.
Depending on the dish, you may also be able to get away with mint or basil. Real Simple recommends Thai basil, which is a great idea I wish I had thought of, because it has a sharp pungency similar to cilantro's. Of course, any major herb substitution is going to change the flavor of the dish.
Try a different form. Coriander seeds are from the cilantro plant, so Williamson says you can try them instead. Some people might find them more palatable. McVicar says the seeds even "develop a delightful orange-like scent.
If you can get your hands on it, micro cilantro is also worth a shot because it's less potent than the full-size plant, Williamson says.
Get used to it! If you're interested in seeing whether you can get over your cilantro aversion, it's certainly possible. Just ask the neuroscientist in McGee's piece, who also happens to be an expert in smell.
McGee notes that crushing cilantro may help eliminate its more soapy aroma substances. He's also a fan of cilantro pesto, which he calls "lotion-free and surprisingly mild. Similarly, I think a good Indian chutney is another great way to go.
"If you can surround yourself with likable dishes, Williamson says, "maybe you can kind of change your attitude toward the actual herb itself.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - Children's television has made heroes out of a bookish aardvark, a singing dinosaur and pizza-munching turtles. It's about time a Native American girl got a shot.
"Molly of Denali," premiering Monday on PBS, breaks new ground with its casting, furthering the case that, when it comes to diversity, kids' programming leads the way.
"Dora the Explorer," which Nickelodeon premiered in 2000, cleared a path for more Latino representation on the airwaves. Disney's "Doc McStuffins," wrapping up its fifth and final season, triggered more than $500 million in merchandise sales in 2013 -- a record for a toy line based on a black character, according to the New York Times. TPT's "Hero Elementary," a science series due to premiere in 2020, will pay just as much attention to diversity as it does to brainpower.
But Molly Mabray is the first star of an animated children's show to be a proud, contributing member of a Native American tribe, sharing her adventures from her Alaska home with young viewers across the country.
"We're going to see Molly and her friends doing everything from dogsledding to working in her garden to traveling with her mom, who is a bush pilot who can't land the plane because there's a moose in the runway," said Lesli Rotenberg, PBS' chief programming executive for children's media and education.
"We're highlighting important values, like knowing who you are, accepting what life brings and honoring your elders. While these values are specific to the Alaskan Native community, they're also universal."
Tradition with a twist
Kids from all backgrounds can relate to Molly's obsessions with the internet, sports, animals and music.
But there's almost always a twist.
The 10-year-old uses the computer to monitor a bald eagle watching over her eggs. She may shoot baskets, but she'd rather be competing in a birch-canoe race.
She's determined to heal her grandpa's emotional wounds after she learns that he lost his love of music after the boarding school he was forced to attend as a child forbade him from playing his people's songs.
She bonds with an intimidating aunt after the two of them come up with a new tribal name for her. No lemonade stand for Molly; instead, she answers phones at the family's trading post.
"She's learning these traditional practices, like snowshoeing or hunting for agate stones, but she's also just an everyday kid that's super-relatable," said the show's creative producer, Princess Daazhraii Johnson.
Johnson, a 13-year Hollywood veteran who grew up in Alaska, is uniquely qualified to lead the series.
Her younger brother, Evon Peter, was the youngest chief in Arctic Village, Alaska. She also has two children at home who are members of the show's target audience.
"Every once in a while when I'm looking at clips for the show," Johnson said, "my 8-year-old will come along and say something like, 'Mom, that's our Native food.' Or there will be a scene where Molly is cutting with an ulu [an all-purpose knife] and he's like, 'You have one of those!'
"I live for those moments. We get to see ourselves represented in this beautiful, positive light, and we are informing what our image looks like."
'I can do that, too'
All the Native American characters are voiced by Native American talent; the Yupik band Pamyua provides the catchy theme song, featuring traditional drums and the Athabaskan fiddle. Dewey Kk'oleyo Hoffman, leadership development director of the First Alaskans Institute, is a consultant.
But not all the characters have Native roots. Trini, a black youngster, has recently moved north after her military father was transferred. In many ways, she represents viewers who might think all Alaskans live in igloos.
"We've got an episode in which Trini has this idea planted in her head from a friend in Texas that polar bears are everywhere and she's terrified to go outside," said series co-creator Dorothea Gillim. "Molly and her friend Tooey want to help Trini feel more at home, so they look at old westerns and get stereotypical ideas of what it means to be Texan. We're really kind of exploring and trying to sort of debunk stereotypes of all types."
Lorne Cardinal, who plays Grandpa Nat, said there's still a perception among his fellow Native Americans they can't be featured in a positive light on TV -- let alone aspire to be in show business themselves.
"When I do Q&As after a theater performance, we have Native people in the audience who say, 'Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to do that,' " said Cardinal, best known for his role as Sgt. Davis Quinton on the Canadian sitcom "Corner Gas."
"We're still having to fight for the idea that we can do anything we want. We still have to do the hard work. There are no free passes. But by us doing this show, there's a step for kids to go, 'Oh, I can do that, too.' "

Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

Investing in resiliency; Hampton Roads must go to greater lengths to become more resilient to intensifying seas and storms

Texto completo: A line of slow-moving summer storms pushed through the Washington, D.C., area on Monday morning, dumping between 3
and 4 inches of rain - the average accumulated precipitation in a typical July - on the nation's capital in an hour's time.
With nowhere to go, the water quickly overwhelmed the District's storm-drain capacity, filling streets and further snarling the always miserable morning commute. Photos poured onto social media of motorists standing on the roofs of submerged vehicles, of waterfalls in underground Metro stations, and of rivers and creeks over-spilling their banks.
Meteorologists calculated that a storm delivering that much rain to that location has a less than 1% chance of occurring in any given year, little comfort for those who saw their cars float away on Monday.
Now, weather is not climate. Temperatures plunging into the single digits for a few days is no more disproves global warming than an hour of intense rainfall serves as proof of climate change. Rather, it's the frequency - the trends - that are the important component.
And as we see this happen time and time again - the two events in three years that destroyed the downtown of Ellicott City in central Maryland for instance, or the days of record rainfall that inundated Houston as part of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, or what New Orleans is absorbing this weekend from Hurricane Barry - it should serve as clear indication of the crisis we now face - and for which we are woefully unprepared.
Set aside for a moment the argument that we must curb greenhouse gas emissions at once in order to slow the planet's continued warming and perhaps avoid the extinction of 1 million species of animal and plant life predicted in the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released earlier this year.
While that is critically important to stave off catastrophe, the lesson of Washington's diluvial disaster is about the dangerously inadequate infrastructure in place to manage heavier and more frequent rains, powerful and more frequent tropical storms, and widespread, costly and, yes, more frequent flooding along the coasts and inland.
The New York Times, reporting about the District flooding, notes that "D.C. Water expected to spend $60 million over 10 years to improve storm-water pumping stations alone." That figure does not include other climate-related projects or annual upkeep of existing lines.
And that's just for stormwater management in one city (albeit one constructed primarily on wetland infill). Boosting stormwater capacity in other metropolitan areas will cost substantially more.
The Times points to a May report by the Water Environment Federation, a nonprofit group that represents waste-water professionals, that municipal storm-water agencies are facing a $7.5 billion annual shortfall to meet requirements of law.
When stormwater systems overflow, they can dump sewage into waterways, as happened in Balitmore on Monday, or fail to move water out fast enough to avoid destructive flooding, as Virginia Beach neighborhoods suffered from Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Both are dangerous and costly.
Protecting coastal communities from storm-surge flooding caused by tropical weather is another issue. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a comprehensive system to defend Houston and the Texas coast that could cost $30 billion. The Corps has proposed barriers in Norfolk that would cost $1.5 billion, and a study conducted by Virginia Beach puts that community's price tag between $2 billion and $4 billion.
As for localities plagued by so-called "blue sky" or "nuisance" flooding driven by sea-level rise and tidal patterns - pay special attention here, ye who call Hampton Roads home - the estimated cost is greater still.
According to a recent reporting by the Center for Climate Integrity, an effort by the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, the United States faces a staggering $400 billion in construction costs by 2040 to protect vulnerable communities from sea-level rise fueled by global warming.
In Virginia alone, that number is $31.2 billion - a figure that includes $1.7 billion for resilience improvements in Virginia Beach, $821 million for Poquoson, $675 million in Chesapeake, $643 million in Hampton and $575 million in Norfolk.
This is a commonwealth which, as the report helpfully points out, had an annual budget of $52.1 billion.
However, the episode that took place Monday in Washington demonstrates the unforgiving, unrelenting destruction facing the United States, a country that is desperately unprepared for it and in which a good number of people are still unwilling to accept this reality.
And a country that refuses to confront these changes, that shrugs off the planning and preparation needed, and certainly does not have the desire - or, at this moment, the capacity - to absorb those costs is making a choice to put millions of its residents in harm's way.
In Hampton Roads, we know because thousands of people here will lose their property, their jobs and perhaps their lives without the urgent action a threat of this size and scope requires. We, as Americans, deserve better than that - and we must demand it.

Sentinel's Anderson appears on CNN podcast

Texto completo: What is the Florida Climate Reporting Network? Julie Anderson, editor-in-chief of the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel, helps supply answers on CNN's "Reliable Sources" and its podcast.
The network, which debuted in June, is a collaboration among the Sentinel, Sun Sentinel, Tampa Bay Times, The Miami Herald, The Palm Beach Post and WLRN Public Media, which is based in South Florida.
"Reliable Sources" airs at 11 a.m. Sunday.
"We're trying to pull together as many resources as we can to do dedicated reporting on the climate crisis in Florida," Anderson tells Brian Stelter on the podcast. "We felt like none of us could do the job alone, but we thought we could do a pretty good job if we pulled our resources together, or at least amplified our voices together."
She is featured with Mark Katches, executive editor of the Tampa Bay Times, and Alex Harris, climate change reporter for The Miami Herald.
"People say we're ground zero down here. We should kind of act like it, right?" Harris tells Stelter.
Katches says the network is "a way to harness the power of great reporting firepower in the state to create something special." He described the network as a "story sharing arrangement."
Anderson explains the network's approach. "We're reporters, we're editors and we are reporting on the situation, but we're not an advocacy group," she said.
The podcast is available on Apple Podcasts, TuneIn and Stitcher.
"Reliable Sources" on CNN this weekend also features a panel on President Donald Trump's meeting with social media provocateurs. The panelists are Jane Coaston, senior politics reporter, Vox; Samantha Vinograd, CNN national security analyst; and Robby Soave, associate editor, Reason, and author of "Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump." Other guests are Renee DiResta, research manager, Stanford Internet Observatory; Oliver Darcy, senior media reporter, CNN; and Katie Rogers, White House correspondent, The New York Times. The Florida panel will be in the program's second half.

Texto completo: The 17th is quite the date

Will the 17th of the month prove yet again to be fateful for an American president?

On June 17, 1972, there was a break-in at the Watergate office complex in Washington, D.C., the headquarters for the Democratic National Committee, which led to an investigation that revealed multiple abuses of power by the Nixon administration. Nixon attempted to cover up the crime, obstructing justice in the process, then lied to the American public swearing he knew nothing about it. He chose to resign rather than suffer impeachment and likely removal from office by the Senate.

On May 17, 2017, Robert Mueller III was appointed special counsel by the office of deputy attorney general for the purpose of investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The mandate included investigating links and/or coordination with the Trump campaign.

On June 17, 2017, President Donald Trump called then White House Counsel, Don McGahn, and directed him to fire Mueller. When McGahn refused and the incident was made public, Trump, like Nixon, ordered a cover-up. He instructed McGahn to create a false document, a letter to the file, refuting the media report. McGahn refused a second time. Trump, again like Nixon, later denied that any of this happened.

On Wednesday  July 17, 2019  Robert Mueller is scheduled to testify before Congress. It is expected that Republicans will attempt to discredit him, rather than address the findings in the report which showed approximately 140 contacts between Trumps team and Russia-linked operatives, also known as collusion. The report also found multiple instances of possible obstruction of justice, which when aired before millions of Americans may be the driving force behind the demise of another American president.

Not exactly the Ritz

President Donald Trump says that immigrants being held in detention facilities have it better there than in their own countries. Oh, really? Well then, expect an increased flood of people leaving their countries seeking our luxury accommodations. To further complicate the issue, Trump cut off funding that was being sent to their countries to improve conditions and lessen the desperation thats making these people come here. Does this make sense?

David Beaven, Clearwater

Trees can save us

The article about planting a trillion trees to fight global warming was the most sensible suggestion I have ever heard. It sure beats any tax-and-spend suggestion that is usually put forward. I believe that the Earth is like a living organism that constantly makes adjustments to keep itself in balance. We can help the Earth regulate itself by reducing that use and by planting millions, billions or trillions of trees. Id just like to add that it is also important that we reduce our dependence on oil, coal and natural gas because those resources are finite. At some point we will have exhausted the supply and, unless we have developed other sources of energy, we will be in deep trouble.

Alfred DAmario, Hudson

Just dont litter

All our counties and municipalities need to have an intense public service anti-littering campaign and impose fines on people who perpetrate this pervasive nastiness. Litter ends up down our storm drains and in our bodies of water, on our streets and in our yards. It makes our communities look junky. In the meantime: Stop littering! Keep your cigarette butts, food wrappers, plastic bottles and bags, dead fireworks, fast food wrappings and cups, leftover food, aluminum cans, coolers, fishing line/hooks/gear, appliances, glass bottles, shoes, flip-flops, tires and mattresses (what am I missing?) to yourself. Do not drop it as you walk/run/jog. Do not leave it behind on the beach or in the park/sports complex. The world is not your personal trash can. That goes for your kids, too.

Ruth Barrens, St. Petersburg

A personal anecdote

As soon as we reached Mach 2 on our Concorde flight to Paris, impeccably attired Air France flight attendants began passing out keepsake Michelin Guides. The next evening, we were delivered to Versailles by bus for a black tie dinner complete with fireworks in the shape of a Chrysler Pentastar. Days later, we would sail triumphantly into New York Harbor aboard the Cunard luxury liner QE2  the grandest ship in the harbor on that glorious July 4 holiday in 1986. A cover page story in the New York Times hailed the arrival of 700 Chrysler dealers as legendary Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca unveiled the newly restored Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in front of an Independence Day celebration for the ages. As we salute Lee Iacoccas legacy, heres the story Mr. Iacocca would want you to remember. Lee and Peggy Iacocca were shopping in the QE2 gift shop. Peggy, in noticing my QE2 sweater (purchased on my first QE2 voyage years earlier), exclaimed, Look, Lido, hes wearing one of those sweaters you like! I knew that the sweater was no longer being produced. I had our stateroom steward box my sweater with an enclosed note and deliver it to the Iacoccas QE2 suite. The letter read as follows: Lee, Your sterling leadership example in turning around Chrysler against all odds literally saved the shirt on my back. This sweater is no longer being made. I want you to have mine. Kindest regards, Will Graves. The next day, a letter on QE2 stationery was delivered to our stateroom that read as follows: Dear Will, I really appreciate your thoughtfulness in having your sweater delivered to me. I want you to keep it and remember our time together on this Statue of Liberty voyage on the QE2. Lee.

Gen Z is swiping left on romance

Texto completo: Facebook and Twitter feeds were buzzing with discussion after the late-May New York Times article declaring that millennials are no longer interested in marriage. The article’s popularity can be attributed, in part, to the uncomfortable truth it laid on an entire generation: that the unwillingness to commit might not be so great for society at large.
But while millennials bear the brunt of negative characterizations in the media, their lack of interest in settling down might be the least of society’s generational worries. Move aside millennials, because fear of commitment itself is personified in Generation Z, a group comprised of individuals born between 1995 and 2015. In a phenomenon that has baffled social scientists and psychologists alike, Generation Z has opted to stop dating entirely.
Gen Z’s difficulty navigating the contours of dating is no surprise. They grew up in an age when boredom could be solved instantaneously by unlocking their smartphones, and the capital of Namibia could be ascertained through a five-second consultation with Siri. Instead of going on dates, romantic interaction among Gen Zers takes the form of instantaneous online communication: swiping through Tinder, exchanging Snapchats, and sending direct messages on Instagram. In fact, the average American adult swipes through dating apps for an average of 77 minutes each day. But why is this a problem?
Dating apps give the impression of an infinite supply of potential partners, making it difficult for Gen Zers to remain content with a single romantic prospect. Even those who don’t use dating apps report feeling like the seemingly endless stream of potential partners on their Instagram feeds makes committing to a relationship much more daunting. Instead of building longer-term connections with romantic partners, Gen Zers build hundreds of surface-level connections with their numerous followers, creating relationships that are empirically less fulfilling than the more serious relationships undertaken by older generations.
This attitude of transience creates problems when it comes to developing confidence and connection. Without the necessity to push out of their romantic comfort zone, Gen Zers have become increasingly stressed and isolated. More than 91% of Gen Z adults report that they have experienced at least one physical or emotional symptom because of stress, such as feeling depressed and lacking interest, motivation, and energy.
In March, Kerry Cronin, a philosophy instructor at Boston College, experimented with how in-person dating affects the mental health of Gen Zers by having them complete an assignment in which they would go on an in-person date, and write a response discussing their experience. Surprisingly, the students gave glowing reviews of the dating assignment, writing that while they were initially afraid, they learned a lot about themselves, gained social confidence, and felt less depressed, sluggish, and isolated.
What’s more, Cronin’s students learned powerful lessons in self-actualization, one commenting that “going on a date helps us get over our fear of failure,” and another reporting that “it makes us feel more vulnerable and that vulnerability helps us learn more about ourselves.” The meaning these students found from engaging in old-fashioned dating is significant. Instead of desperately searching for connection through hourlong Tinder sessions, it’s time for Gen Z to inject a shot of confidence by going out on real dates with their peers. Bad dates build character, and good dates build relationships. Both outcomes are preferable to Generation Z’s current romantic isolation.
Perhaps we should take our dating cue from Nora Ephron, the famous 90s rom-com screenwriter. When asked whether she thought going on bad dates was a waste of time, she responded, “I have made a lot of mistakes falling in love, and regretted most of them, but never the potatoes that went with them.”
With only confidence, human connection, and new perspectives to gain from going on dates, it’s time for Gen Zers to delete Bumble and start connecting with their peers face-to-face, even if not every dinner results in an undeniable love connection. Per Nora’s adage, if your dinner date with the intern in the neighboring cubicle is truly unsalvageable, the roasted potatoes you’ll consume during dinner and the confidence you’ll gain along the way will serve as unparalleled consolation prizes.

Donald Trump Jr., Cory Gardner fire up conservatives at Denver summit

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. brought a ballroom full of conservatives to its feet Friday night in Denver with attacks on the press, social media giants and naysayers he mocked for refusing to acknowledge the achievements of his father's presidency.
"We're winning, and we're not sick of winning, and we're not going to stop," Trump Jr. told more than 1,000 in attendance at the annual Western Conservative Summit at the Colorado Convention Center.
President Trump's eldest son and namesake prompted cheers of "USA!" as his 30-minute keynote address capped the first day of the summit, billed as the largest right-leaning gathering in the country outside the nation's capital.

"The reality is, the left hates Donald Trump much more than they love America," Trump Jr. told the avid crowd after ripping the news media for ignoring his father's successes with the economy and on the world stage.
"You have an American president with the greatest economic track record in history that gets 97% negative coverage from the press," Trump Jr. said, calling the media's bias evidence of a growing "level of insanity."
He noted that he regularly stumps "woke" college students by asking them to name a single economic measure showing the country isn't better off today than before his father took office.
Touting the Trump administration's record of "promises made, promises kept," Trump Jr. declared: "The world watched as we got our resolve back. The world watched as America took its rightful place as the leader of the free world."
While Trump Jr. doesn't have a formal role in the administration — he and his brother Eric Trump took the reins at the Trump Organization after their father won the 2016 election — he has become one of the president's top campaigners and inspired talk of a White House bid of his own after his father faces term limits.
About an hour before Trump addressed the confab, U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner previewed his campaign for a second term in a fiery speech that took aim at what he called the Democrats' "normalization of socialism," saying the opposition party's lurch to the left threatens the faith and freedom cherished by his audience.

Both Republicans served up sizzling helpings of red meat from the same stage occupied that morning by Gov. Jared Polis, Colorado's first openly gay and first Jewish governor — and the first Democratic elected official to address the conservative summit in its 10 years.
Invoking the Green New Deal, the New York Times opinion page and the prospect of Bernie Sanders naming two justices to the U.S. Supreme Court, a pugnacious Gardner barked: "We have to go on the offensive, and we have to fight."
After extolling the virtues of rural America and accusing "big-city politicians who are more enamored by a resumé than by accomplishments" of wanting to leave rural Americans behind, Gardner nodded to a recent emblem of the culture wars.
"Since when did wearing the Betsy Ross flag become akin to wearing a swastika?" he asked as the crowd jeered.
"We cannot be silenced while the far-left bullies Americans into a sense of shame about who we are, where we live, how we worship," Gardner said, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the crowd.
While 11 Democrats are running in a primary for the chance to challenge Gardner's 2020 re-election bid, the Yuma Republican made clear who he intends to run against.
He tore into Sanders, saying the self-described democratic socialist's policies have become "a litmus test for Democrats" after the Vermont senator staged a "successful hostile takeover of the Democratic Party."
RELATED: Western Conservative Summit honors John Andrews
"They are running on socialism because they think they can win on socialism. It's what the radical fringe has demanded," Gardner said, noting that Sanders won Colorado's 2016 presidential caucus.
"Just look at the policies their party now stands for — socialized medicine, the Green New Deal, eliminating the Electoral College, dictating what job you can and cannot have, packing the courts, massive tax increases, open borders and the list goes on and on and on."
Gardner drew the loudest cheers during his 20-minute speech when he enumerated the number of federal judges — including two spots on the U.S. Supreme Court — filled by Trump and the GOP-controlled Senate.
"Now I know that the next president will likely choose two Supreme Court justices. I know who President Trump would select — someone like Colorado's Allison Eid," he said, name-checking the former Colorado Supreme Court justice appointed by Trump to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
"And I know who Bernie Sanders would select. Castro, anyone?"
Western Conservative Summit honors John Andrews
The evening session also included remarks from conservative campus organizer Charlie Kirk and a tribute to Centennial Institute founder John Andrews, a former president of the Colorado Senate.
In his remarks accepting the award for a lifetime of achievements, Andrews railed against Islam, calling it "a religion that doesn't believe in freedom" with core tenants that are incompatible with American democracy.
America, Andrews said, has two enemies. "The name of one is Marx, and the name of the other is Mohammad," he said, standing alongside banners that displayed the 2019 summit's theme: "Defending Religious Freedom and America's First Amendment."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Grupos proinmigrantes denunciaron este sábado que las redadas anunciadas por el Gobierno del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, contra indocumentados “aterrorizarán a menores y separarán familias”.
La presidenta de la organización Families Belong Together, Jess Morales Rocketto, señaló en un comunicado que “la crueldad es el punto: las redadas masivas aterrorizarán a menores, separarán familias y creará el caos por el país”.
“La Administración (de Trump) está ejecutando una agenda cruel, supremacista blanca para traumatizar a familias en vez de tomar acciones para abordar las condiciones horribles que están matando a menores migrantes bajo custodia de EEUU”, dijo Morales Rocketto.
Por su parte, Mary Bauer, responsable de Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC, en inglés), hizo hincapié en un comunicado en que el Gobierno actual “está aterrorizando deliberadamente” a familias y comunidades de inmigrantes.
“El maltrato continuado de los menores en instalaciones de detención, los ataques a nuestro sistema de asilo y los asaltos a comunidades de inmigrantes mediante la amenaza de redadas muestran que la prioridad de esta Administración es aterrorizar a comunidades y no resolver los problemas migratorios de nuestra nación”, consideró.
Bauer indicó que “con la reciente aprobación de fondos adicionales para esas agencias (migratorias) sin salvaguardas adicionales, el Congreso también asume ahora la responsabilidad de estas tácticas continuas”.
“Estas agencias, que están maltratando intencionadamente a hombres, mujeres y menores y separando a familias, se han envalentonado por las acciones de los legisladores”, lamentó.
El presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, confirmó este viernes que su Gobierno iniciará el domingo redadas masivas en unas 10 ciudades para deportar a “miles” de indocumentados.
En declaraciones a los periodistas en la Casa Blanca, Trump respondió afirmativamente cuando le preguntaron si es cierto que el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE, en inglés) empezará sus redadas este domingo, como adelantaron el jueves varios medios de comunicación.
La operación se centrará en las ciudades de Nueva York, Miami (Florida), Houston (Texas), Los Ángeles y San Francisco (California), Chicago (Illinois), Atlanta (Georgia), Baltimore (Maryland) y Denver (Colorado), de acuerdo con fuentes oficiales citadas por la cadena de televisión CNN.
Estaba previsto que también hubiera redadas en Nueva Orleans (Luisiana), pero el ICE comunicó a las autoridades de la ciudad que suspenderá temporalmente la operación debido a la tormenta tropical Barry, transformada ya en huracán.
Según funcionarios consultados por el diario The New York Times, ICE buscará primero a unos 2,000 inmigrantes que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación y que, en algunos casos, no se presentaron a las audiencias en los tribunales de inmigración.
En las últimas horas, grupos y ciudadanos opuestos a las redadas, han realizado manifestaciones en contra de Trump y sus políticas en estados como California, Washington, Utah, entre otros.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- His police chief in Nangarhar Province needed more heavy weapons. His police chief in Paktia Province needed more radios. And Brig. Gen. Khoshal Sadat needed the two men to stop reading directly from their PowerPoint slides as they rattled off the security situation in their districts during their video conference.
General Sadat, the 35-year-old deputy minister of security in Afghanistan, is the highest-ranking police official in the country. And if the high-tech briefings he instituted after taking the job in February seem to take a page right out of the American military's playbook, there's a good reason: He is a leader among the first generation of homegrown Afghan generals to emerge from the American training program here after the 2001 invasion.
He has risen at a dire time for the Afghan police forces, which have been taking devastating casualties during insurgent offensives and, perhaps more troubling in the long term, have never shaken the reputation for corruption and abuse that has made the Taliban seem like a more attractive alternative to many Afghans.
General Sadat will be under heavy scrutiny in his new post, both to see whether he can turn the police forces around and whether he falls prey to the culture of nepotism and corruption that runs deep in the Afghan government.
He joined the Afghan Army in 2003, two years after American forces first entered the country and rose through the ranks as an elite commando. He studied at elite British and American military schools, and eventually served as an aide to the commander of all American forces in Afghanistan before taking command of his own.
General Sadat "represents a new generation of Afghan leadership," Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of the American-led mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement. "When soldiers know you care, they will fight."
Shah Mohammad, a police officer in the rugged eastern province of Paktika, is one of those foot soldiers, and he says he has been encouraged by General Sadat's early performance.
Mr. Mohammad said he had often been frustrated in his logistics requests, begging for blankets, mattresses or other needed supplies to little effect.
"We asked and shared this problem with the Ministry of Interior, and Mr. Khoshal Sadat took action without delay," he said recently. "We are happy, and we need some commanders and higher-ranking officials who listen to our problems and take action."
Several other police officers in distant provinces echoed those sentiments in interviews with The New York Times, praising General Sadat's can-do attitude and willingness to lead from the front. He often goes on missions with Kabul's elite police response force despite his high-ranking job in the ministry.
But the challenges are steep. The Afghan National Police, composed of 116,000 officers, many of them falsely enrolled on official manifests, is riddled with corruption and savaged almost daily by Taliban attacks and casualties. General Sadat faces the task of saving an organization that many have deemed unfixable.
"We've had bad leadership," General Sadat said during a recent interview in his office at the Ministry of Interior. "And I had to stop the bleeding."
General Sadat has fired 27 out of the 34 police chiefs across the country, he said, replacing all except five with young officers from special operations units.
The way it used to work, he explained, was that candidates would pay thousands of dollars to get their name on a list of possible police chiefs that would go to the president for approval.
"The process was run by money," General Sadat said. "The system was bad, and right in the middle I broke that deal."
Some officials are concerned about the pace of change, though.
Gharanay Khowakhogay, a former deputy director for the National Directorate of Security, lauded the influx of young people, like General Sadat, into leadership positions, but said that they need more experience alongside some of the older Afghan officers before assuming such roles.
"The responsibility should have been transferred to the young generation step by step, not in a very fast move," Mr. Khowakhogay said. "The young police and military officials lack military management and operational experience."
While General Sadat's initiatives have been well received, that has not stopped the young deputy minister from worrying about losing his subordinates to corruption. Every night before he goes to bed, he calls five police chiefs from varying provinces and checks in, he said.
They are short calls, but just long enough to reaffirm that their boss in Kabul isn't that far away.
"If I don't push, they get lazy," General Sadat said.
General Sadat's quick rise, without the close familial ties with high-ranking government officials that usually ensure promotion in the Afghan military, was noticed. He was picked to attend the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in England, where he graduated in 2007. In 2009, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top American commander in Afghanistan at the time, quickly took Mr. Sadat, then a major, as his aide-de-camp.
General Sadat describes General McChrystal as an important mentor, and his time with the American cemented his reputation as a rising young Afghan leader. But his Western friends and the hard-charging style he and other young officers embraced made them targets for the Afghan president at the time.
In 2014, President Hamid Karzai suspended three Afghan special operations leaders, including then-Lieutenant Colonel Sadat, when he was commanding the elite police unit that guards Kabul, the 222, for making illegal detentions and collaborating with American and British forces during the presidential elections.
On leave in 2016, General Sadat visited Mr. McChrystal at his home in Northern Virginia. The American offered him a job with his consulting company. Soured by Mr. Karzai's attempts to drive him from the Afghan security forces, General Sadat applied for a work visa and joined the McChrystal Group.
This year, after three years of advising Fortune 500 companies, General Sadat returned to visit his mother in Afghanistan, where a new president was in charge, Ashraf Ghani. Mr. Ghani's national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib -- himself just 36 -- offered Mr. Sadat the national police chief post in the Interior Ministry.
Mr. Sadat again turned to Mr. McChrystal for advice, setting him on the path he's navigating now.
"I wouldn't have said it a couple years ago," he quoted Mr. McChrystal as telling him, "but do it."

Texto completo: FARMINGTON — The lineup of offerings for the inaugural Four Corners Film Festival in September continues to grow.
The festival, which will take place Sept. 10-15 at the Totah Theater and the Farmington Civic Center, will feature film screenings, panel discussions, workshops, an awards ceremony, a fashion show and parties. It is being organized by local independent filmmaker Brent Garcia.
Garcia said last week that nearly 270 films had been submitted for inclusion in the festival.
"So we're going to have a really good offering of films this year," he said.
A recent addition to the festival's offerings is a music production panel that will include some industry heavyweights discussing the licensing of music for films. Garcia said the panel will feature TJ Chapman, industry executive, artist manager and tastemaker; Issy Sanchez, a 40-year music industry veteran and president of Music IS Entertainment; Soren Baker, a journalist who writes about hip hop and sports, and whose work has been featured in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune; and Steve Migliore, a.k.a, Mr. Mig, a producer, composer and DJ who has worked with artists ranging from Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Britney Spears to Adele, LeAnn Rimes and Usher.
"That panel's going to be exceptional," Garcia said.
Also taking part in the festival will be Farmington native John Austin, a.k.a. Poppin John, an internationally known dancer who recently advanced to the division finals on the NBC-TV series "World of Dance" before being eliminated. Austin will perform during a fashion show that Garcia promises will be a full theatrical production.
The reception to the festival has been very encouraging, he said, explaining he is very pleased with the quality of industry professionals who have agreed to take part and the sponsorship it has drawn from local businesses.
"For our first year, it's massive," he said. "We have an overwhelming amount of support from the businesses in the community to the city and the county."
Garcia acknowledged that the recent media attention and social media buzz that developed when two large film productions — a sequel to "Jumanji" starring Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart, and "Bios," a sci-fi drama starring Tom Hanks — shot footage in the Shiprock area may have helped his cause considerably.
"Certainly, the bigger productions coming in helped validate (the idea that the film industry can have a significant impact on San Juan County)," he said, adding that his film production company has been in communication with producers of a handful of smaller-budget projects — somewhere in the low seven figures — who are interested in shooting in San Juan County next spring.
A committee of nearly three dozen people has been planning the festival, Garcia said, and several subcommittees are focusing on specific areas. Garcia said that has allowed his full-time team from the Film Four Corners organization to avoid becoming overwhelmed as the festival approaches.
"A lot of businesses are throwing people at us," he said, describing offers of free manpower. "There's been a ton of support, so it's made it much more manageable for me and my team."
Garcia said he has been pleasantly surprised at how local businesses and residents have responded to the festival, given the fact that many of them have no familiarity with such events.
"It's more than I expected for our first year," he said of the financial and volunteer support. "It really took us four and a half or five months just to properly present it to people."
The preparations for the festival have gone so smoothly that Garcia said it has led to plans for another major event in Farmington early in 2020. When Civic Center supervisor Randy West approached Garcia with the idea of holding a comic convention at the facility, Garcia jumped on the idea. Plans for the event are being formalized, with an eye toward staging it in early January.
"We're anticipating 1,000 or more people for the film festival," Garcia said. "And we'll probably have more for the comic con. Between those, we'll have a couple of good events that will drive business to downtown."
Garcia said he has spoken to filmmakers from as far away as Boston and Atlanta who already are making plans to attend the film festival. He believes the event will be an even easier sell next year when organizers have the inaugural event under their belt.
"I think next year we'll have people calling us and asking how to get involved," he said.
Mike Easterling can be reached at 505-564-4610.
Four Corners Film Festival organizer Brent Garcia says approximately 270 entries were received for the event, which will take place in September.

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Texto completo: Jim Bouton, a once-promising pitcher with the New York Yankees who found greater fame as the author of "Ball Four," an irreverent, best-selling book that angered baseball's hierarchy and changed the way journalists and fans viewed the sports world, died Wednesday at his home in Great Barrington, Mass. He was 80.
He had a stroke in 2012 and five years later disclosed he had been diagnosed with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition that causes vessels in the brain to burst under pressure. The death was confirmed by his wife, Paula Kurman.
Bouton was a hard-throwing right-hander who won 21 games for the Yankees in 1963 and 18 the following season, helping lead his team to the World Series both years.
After an arm injury, he lost his fastball and was relegated to the minor leagues before trying to revive his career as a knuckleball pitcher.
Bouton had often regaled listeners with tales of his antics in baseball, and as he sought to make the roster of the 1969 Seattle Pilots, he decided to take notes.
"Ball Four" - the title was suggested by a woman who overheard Bouton talking about his project in a bar - was published in 1970, with the editorial help of sportswriter Leonard Shecter.
It was in the form of a season-long diary and was modeled in part on "The Long Season," a 1960 book by big-league pitcher Jim Brosnan. But no one had ever captured the humor, profanity and pathos of a major-league clubhouse with the candor that Bouton did in "Ball Four."
"When I made it to the Yankees," he told the New York Times in 1983, "it was like walking in this wonderland, this crazy place ... With 'Ball Four,' I never meant to make an investigation of a subculture. I just wanted to share the nonsense."
When excerpts appeared in Look magazine, guardians of baseball's traditions - including sportswriters, players and executives - were aghast. Bouton had broken baseball taboos, they fumed, revealing that players cheated on their wives, took amphetamines, drank to excess and cursed with colorful abandon.
Baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn wanted "Ball Four" banned and summoned Bouton to his office, demanding that he repudiate his own book.
Bouton refused to change a word, and the publicity helped make "Ball Four" one of the best-selling sports books of all time, with more than 5.5 million copies in print.
Bouton was often vilified by hidebound sportswriters and ballplayers. During a game, Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose shouted his review from the dugout: "F--- you, Shakespeare!"
Before "Ball Four," other athletes, including Brosnan and football player Jerry Kramer, had written books chronicling the inner world of professional sports. But Bouton's bawdy, unexpurgated view from the clubhouse was a breakthrough.
Sports Illustrated named it the third best book ever written on sports, after A.J. Liebling's "The Sweet Science," about boxing, and Roger Kahn's elegy to the Brooklyn Dodgers, "The Boys of Summer."

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies.
But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them.
They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number.
The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine.
That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded?
With his characteristic deflection and denial.
("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.")
Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing – to no avail.
Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage – to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

'THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS': PEDUTO, COMMUNITY LEADERS REACT TO NEWS OF ICE RAIDS

Texto completo: After The New York Times reported that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency plans to conduct raids across the nation Sunday, community leaders and immigration organizations in Pittsburgh expressed their concerns and anger.
According to the Times, ICE officials are targeting more than 2,000 illegal immigrants over the span of a few days in at least 10 major cities.
Families who are arrested together may be held in one of three family detention centers located only in Pennsylvania and Texas. Pennsylvania hosts one family detention center, known as the Berks Family Residential Center in Berks County.
ICE officials in Philadelphia, which oversees the Pittsburgh region, said in a written statement that they would not offer specific details related to enforcement operations due to "law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel."
On Thursday afternoon, Mayor Bill Peduto said he was not aware of any additional ICE enforcement in Pittsburgh.
"Usually when something like that does occur and there is a warning, I'm usually notified that day," Mr. Peduto said. "So unless something just happened this morning that I'm unaware of, it would be highly unlikely that there is something credible."
Jamie Englert, director of immigration and legal services at Jewish Family and Community Services, said although she is concerned about the increase in ICE enforcement, she does not believe it will largely affect the local region. JFCS works to settle refugees.
In the event a family member does get detained by ICE officials, Ms. Englert said, JFCS has "deportation preparedness packets" that contain information on what a family can do moving forward - from how to pay for rent to provisions on guardianship of children if both parents are detained.
Ms. Englert said she also informs the community on the rights people have when encountering ICE officials.
"Generally, if ICE knocks on your door, in order for you to be required to open the door, they must have a signed warrant for your arrest that must be signed by an immigration judge not just by the ICE officer," Ms. Englert said.
Ms. Englert said ICE officials also have tactics prompting an arrest.
"Sometimes they pretend to be local police, sometimes they pretend to have a warrant that's not a warrant," Ms. Englert said. "Because it is an intimidating situation, even if they know their rights, they can be coerced and tricked into situations that are undesirable."
The Rev. Randall Bush, senior pastor at East Liberty Presbyterian Church, said he is "appalled" at the nationwide raids and that they are "totally counterproductive" and "far more invasive and dehumanizing" than detaining people at the individual level.
For four years, the church has provided a field office for Casa San Jose - a community resource center for the Latino community - where churchgoers can seek services and legal advice from members.
The Rev. Bush said mass raids affect more people than just those being detained.
"These tactics by ICE not only disrupt people that are working currently, but it makes everyone scared," the Rev. Bush said. "Parents don't let their children go out, parents can't get groceries, can't get medicine. They're scared to go to a bus stop."
Leslie Aizenman, director of Refugee and Immigrant Services at JFCS, said the raids also stir fear among refugees who are afraid they will be asked to leave even though they are here legally.
Laura Perkins, emergency response organizer at Casa San Jose, said the mass raids are a strategy to instill fear to prevent more immigrants from coming into the country.
Ms. Perkins said many people have reached out to Casa San Jose to ask what they can do to express their frustration and help the community in response to the reports on ICE detention centers and the ICE raids. Ms. Perkins said Casa San Jose and six other local organizations will co-host a "Lights for Liberty vigil" on Friday as part of a nationwide event organized to protest U.S. detention centers and urge government officials to close the facilities.
During the vigil, organizations such as Casa San Jose, 1Hood Media, All for All and Pittsburgh United will call on Gov. Tom Wolf to issue an Emergency Removal Order, or ERO, to close the Berks Family Residential Center, according to a news release.
Kim Dinh, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Immigration and Citizenship Coalition, said the vigil is not in direct response to the reports of a mass raid, but it is relevant to the cause.
The event, which will take place from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Friday at Schenley Plaza, is being held on the birthday of Antwon Rose II, the teenager who died after an East Pittsburgh police officer shot him in 2018. The event will offer a moment of silence in memory of his life.
"There are obvious parallels between the situation of those detained in ICE detention centers and the millions of black Americans incarcerated in this country's prison system," 1Hood Media CEO Jasiri X stated in a news release.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In a Thursday morning press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to address the public back and forth between her and the progressive wing of the House Democratic Caucus.
"I said what I'm going to say in the caucus. They took offense because I addressed at the request of my members an offensive tweet," said Pelosi. "My members took offense at that, I addressed that. . . I'm not going to be addressing it any further. "
Pelosi was referring to an outspoken group of four freshmen representatives: Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. ; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. ; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. ; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. They are colloquially referred to as "the Squad. "
Directly addressing some of their complaints, though, Pelosi said that legislation would be introduced in the coming weeks to ensure the health and safety of children at the border.

"Most of it is what we wanted the Senate to accept before the break," Pelosi explained. "When it comes to children, I'm a lioness, I'm going to protect our cubs. "
Here is how we got to this point.
How did this public back-and-forth start?
The conflict between Pelosi and progressive Democrats stemmed from a debate over a spending package for humanitarian relief on the southern U. S. border. Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats had wanted to add stronger protections for migrants in the initial House draft of the bill and were the only four Democratic lawmakers to vote against it, which ended up not being the final version of the bill.
Pelosi later caved to Republicans and allowed the House to pass the Senate version of the bill, a compromise version lacking many of the protections for children progressive Democrats and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus had called for. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus had called the bill a "betrayal of American values. "
"They're just four people"
Pelosi had dismissed the first-term lawmakers in a July 6 interview with the New York Times, saying "they're just four people. "
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said, according to Maureen Dowd's column in the Times. "But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got. "
These comments provoked a backlash from the four lawmakers.
Twitter sniping
"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment," Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter. "And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. "
Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti said on Twitter that the four Democrats had opposed Pelosi's version of the bill because they did not trust a promise he says McConnell made to Pelosi that he would pass the House version of the bill.
"Nah. It is deeper than that," Tlaib wrote in response to Chakrabarti's tweet. "Why would we fund a broken system that rips children away from their parents, deny asylum seekers due process & fuels a racist ideology that dehumanizes people?"
Tlaib also retweeted two posts that fired back at Pelosi's comment to Dowd, including one from immigrants right advocate Greisa Martínez Rosas who said, "The strategy is simple: Don’t fall for lies. Play to Win," and another from Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein that pointed out the "pivotal policy proposals" authored by each member of "The Squad. "
"You know they’re just salty about WHO is wielding the power to shift 'public sentiment' these days, sis. Sorry not sorry," Omar tweeted.
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it"
In the weekly House Democrat breakfast on July 10, Pelosi addressed the complaints, urging respect among her fellow Democrats.
"You got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it," Pelosi told the group, according to a source in the room. "But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK. "
"On a team you play as a team. If you want to be not on the team, that is OK because that is part of the team spirit – you just want to not play in that round," Pelosi said.
She said, "I hope there will be some level of respect and sensitivity for our – each individual experience that we bring to this caucus. "
"I take responsibility," Pelosi said, according to the source. Referring to two centrist coalitions of Democrats, she added, "You make me the target, but don’t make our Blue Dogs and our new Dems the target in all of this because we have important fish to fry. "

"Explicit singling out of newly elected women of color"
Ocasio-Cortez later argued that Pelosi's comments and alleged isolation of the progressive wing amounted to "the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color. "
“When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,” Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview with the Washington Post. “But the persistent singling out .  .  . it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful .  .  . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color. ”

Texto completo: STAFF AT PNC PARK GOES BEYOND DUTY
On Wednesday, June 19, I attended the Pirates game against the Detroit Tigers at PNC Park. Included in my party was my sister, who relies on a wheeled walker when in crowds.
As we were waiting for the rest of our family to join us, we were approached by a member of the guest services staff who offered us a wheelchair to take my sister to our seats. I was not aware of this service, and we immediately took him up on his offer. One member of the staff, Vanessa, appeared with the wheelchair and took us to our section.
She also informed us that if we told our usher after the game was over, a wheelchair could be used to exit the park as well.
Because I have never needed this service before, I was totally unaware that is was available. The lengths to which the staff went to help us was beyond our expectations.
We just want to acknowledge PNC Park for making this experience a very pleasant one for all of us.
To top it off, it was my birthday, and we brought home a win.

GOOD FRIEND FILLS ROLE OF GOOD SAMARITAN
This random act took place during the bitter polar vortex in January.
My best friend, Sue, who lives in Ross, was on her way home after shopping at the West View Giant Eagle when she saw an elderly gentleman slip and fall on the side of the road.
She watched as several cars in front of her drove past as he lay there. She pulled over and rendered assistance, asking if he was OK. He assured her that he was. She then asked where he was going, and he said Giant Eagle. She helped him into her car, took him to the store and waited until he was finished shopping.
The man assured her he was fine and thanked her many times over.
She wanted no recognition for her deed, but the story deserves to be told.

NEWSPAPER DELIVERER TAKES EXTRA STEPS
Thanks to Rick Gaetano. It is a delight to open my door in the morning to find that he has taken the time to put my Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The New York Times on my front porch.
It obviously is something he does not have to do on Tuesdays and Saturdays when the Post-Gazette is not delivered. And when someone else delivers the Times, it is a game of hide-and-seek to find it. I found my May 25 edition of the Times in the forsythia bushes.
So it is with extreme gratitude that I thank Rick for his kindness and for the extra steps to put my papers on the front porch.
The Post-Gazette is fortunate to have him.

Gay Soldiers Can Serve. But They May Face Prison.

Texto completo: SEOUL, South Korea -- The army lieutenant knew his career was irrevocably damaged when military investigators visited him in 2017, demanding that he admit having had sex with another male soldier -- a crime in South Korea's military.
When the investigators put him on a video call with his ex-lover, who admitted to the relationship, he felt he had to confess. Then they seized the lieutenant's smartphone, pressing him to identify gay soldiers in his contact lists. And they humiliated him with questions like "What sex positions did you use?" and "Where did you ejaculate?"
The lieutenant -- who in an interview asked to be identified only by his surname, Kim -- could have gone to prison, but his indictment was suspended because of his "contrition." He chose to leave the army, though, believing that he no longer had a future there.
South Korea's military says it does not discriminate against sexual minorities. But Mr. Kim is one of an increasing number of gay or transgender soldiers who have been persecuted under Article 92-6 of the Army Criminal Act, which has been used to out them and punish them for consensual sex, Amnesty International said in a report released on Thursday.
Under Article 92-6, "anal sex and other indecent acts" between military personnel can be punished by up to two years in prison, even if they take place off base, while the soldiers are off duty and by mutual consent. Repeated attempts by advocates for L.G.B.T. and intersex people to abolish the law have been unsuccessful.
"South Korea's military must stop treating L.G.B.T.I. people as the enemy," said Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International. The group's report, "Serving in Silence," also details sexual and other abuses inflicted on gay soldiers, or soldiers perceived as gay, by their superiors and their fellow soldiers.
"It is long overdue for the military to acknowledge that a person's sexual orientation is totally irrelevant to their ability to serve," Ms. Rife said.
The South Korean government says Article 92-6 is not meant to punish sexual orientation. Rather, it says, it is needed to deter sexual abuse in the army, which is almost entirely male. The country's Constitutional Court has repeatedly ruled that the article is justified by the military's need to preserve discipline and "combat power."
South Korea, which technically has been in a state of war with North Korea for decades, has a conscript army of about 600,000 soldiers. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve for about two years.
The military says it does not bar gay and transgender people from serving, and the Defense Ministry has expanded training on protecting the rights of sexual minorities. What is forbidden, the army says, is not sexual identity, but what the law calls "indecent" sexual activity.
Enforcement of Article 92-6 has been on the rise. The number of soldiers charged under it went from two per year in 2009 and 2010 to 14 in 2012, then 28 in 2017. Ten soldiers were charged in the first half of 2018, the most recent period for which data was available.
Military veterans have long reported discrimination against homosexuals in the army, as well as more widespread abuses like beatings, hazing and bullying. Most gay soldiers have hidden their sexual orientation for fear of being outed and harassed.
In 2017, the year Mr. Kim was interrogated, the army launched a particularly aggressive crackdown based on Article 92-6, confiscating soldiers' cellphones without warrants and forcing them to identify other soldiers with whom they'd had sex, according to the Military Human Rights Center, a civic group based in Seoul, the capital.
Nine active-duty soldiers were indicted, of whom eight were convicted, including a captain who received a suspended prison term. Several of the cases are being appealed, and none of the soldiers have been sent to prison, according to Lim Tae-hoon, director of the Military Human Rights Center of Korea, which provides legal assistance for the soldiers.
Fourteen other soldiers were investigated but not indicted -- some of whom, including Mr. Kim, have petitioned the Constitutional Court to rule Article 92-6 unconstitutional, Mr. Lim said.
In South Korea, which has been slow to embrace the rights of sexual minorities, that 2017 crackdown triggered an unusual degree of outrage.
In recent years, gay people have become more visible in the country. But conservative Christian groups have also escalated demonstrations against homosexuality in major cities, often calling gay soldiers a threat to military readiness.
Those groups helped to scuttle attempts in Parliament to pass an anti-discrimination law, urged on South Korea by the United Nations, that would give sexual minorities the same protections that other minority groups have.
Amnesty International's report describes in vivid detail how antigay attitudes have translated into physical and sexual abuse within the military.
One former soldier told the rights group he had been forced to have oral and anal sex with another gay soldier, as a superior taunted, "Don't you want to have sex with a womanlike man?" Others have been sexually abused for "not being masculine enough," walking in an "effeminate" way or having a high-pitched voice, according to the report.
Amnesty said it interviewed 21 former, current and future soldiers for the report, most of whom used pseudonyms, including Mr. Kim. One of them, Jeram Yunghun Kang, agreed to the use of his full name in an interview with The New York Times.
Mr. Kang, who joined the army in 2008, said other soldiers in his unit harassed him by groping him, kissing his neck and pulling down his underwear. After he confided to an officer that he was gay and asked for help, his battalion commander outed him in front of his entire unit, asking him, "Who did you seduce last night?"
From that day on, Mr. Kang said, he had to wear a "smiley face" pin on his chest, marking him as a "soldier of special interest."
"I had to take showers alone," Mr. Kang said by telephone from London. "I was considered dirty, someone neither male nor female who should not be naked in the presence of other men."
Mr. Kang was eventually sent to a military psychiatric ward, where he was forced to take antidepressants twice a day. Staffers there advised him to pretend to be insane so he could be ruled unfit for service and expelled from the military.
Mr. Kang refused. Instead, he said, he attempted suicide twice. He was put in solitary confinement, his limbs tied to a bed.
"While I was tied there in a room where there was no sound or light allowed in, I felt that there was nowhere for me to run in South Korea," he said. After 116 days in a hospital, he was expelled from the military in 2009 for psychiatric reasons.
Mr. Kang's mother, who raised him alone, sold her house so he could go to London, to live and study in a more accepting environment. Since moving there in 2016, he has drawn on his experience in the military to create installation art and a self-published book.
Now, his student visa about to expire, Mr. Kang is afraid to come home.
"I left South Korea as if I were fleeing," he said. "I dread going back there. I feel like I am a refugee."

CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD; 60 years on, 'Gidget' still 'absolute ultimate'; The real Gidget loved to surf -- 'I felt I could do this.' Her stories inspired the franchise.

Texto completo: Correction: Gidget: An article in the July 11 Calendar section about Kathy Kohner Zuckerman, who inspired the Gidget novels, movies and television show, said that the documentary "Accidental Icon: The Real Gidget Story" would be screened at 3 p.m. Saturday at Laemmle's Ahrya Fine Arts in Beverly Hills. The screening time has been changed to 2 p.m.
As a teenager growing up in Malibu in the 1950s, Kathy Kohner liked to hang out with the surfing set. But she wasn't content with just being an onlooker.
"I was 16. I didn't want to be the girl on the beach looking at the men," she recalled recently. "I wanted to surf. It was not a competitive sport; I was competing against myself. I felt I could do this, I could be like one of them."
Her stories delighted her Oscar-nominated screenwriter father, Frederick Kohner, who wrote a novel, "Gidget: The Little Girl With Big Ideas," in six weeks, based on her tales. It was published in 1957 and reportedly outsold Jack Kerouac's beat classic, "On the Road," which was released the same year. Kohner would write five "Gidget" novels and two film novelizations.

The first book spawned the movie "Gidget," this year celebrating its 60th anniversary. The iconic film starred Sandra Dee as Francine Lawrence, who finds her place in the sun among a tight-knit clan of Malibu surfers. Her diminutive size earns her the moniker Gidget ("girl" plus a name for a little person) from the guys.
She falls in love with one of them, Moondoggie (James Darren), who is bent on making it as a full-time "surf bum" like the gang's charismatic shack-dwelling leader, Kahuna (Cliff Robertson).
The New York Times called the film a "frolic" and "an ideal way to usher in the beach season." It did more than that, however, spawning a wave of American beach movies that were a sunny departure from such juvenile delinquency pictures as "The Blackboard Jungle," which had been all the rage.
"Gidget" lured more people into the ocean than "Jaws" would later scare them out of it. But six decades on, "Gidget" is more than a mere fun-in-the-sun romp. After the Woolsey Fire devastated Malibu last year, the Malibu Film Society was determined to help in the healing process. To lift the community's spirits, it turned to the 1959 film. A special screening held recently packed the house. And front and center at the event was Kathy Kohner -- now Kathy Zuckerman.
The film society's executive director, Scott Talall, noted in an email: "For the first time since the fire, it finally felt like we were started to get our community back."
Gidget bounced around the globe in the sequels "Gidget Goes Hawaiian" (1961), starring Deborah Walley, and the beachless "Gidget Goes to Rome" (1963), starring Cindy Carol. As the star of the "Gidget" TV series, which premiered in 1965 and lasted one season, Sally Field made the biggest splash in the role since Dee.
There was a made-for-TV movie, "Gidget Grows Up," in 1969, and sequels and reboots continued through the 1980s.
But the original film remains, as Gidget might say, the absolute ultimate. "The basis of the story is true," Zuckerman, 78, said in a phone interview.
She did not score a cameo in the feature film, but she did spend time with Dee -- she has a picture of herself with the actress in a hammock. Zuckerman was at what is now Oregon State University when "Gidget" was released and remembers how surreal it was to sit in the campus theater watching a movie based on her life.
Gidget, to her, was a state of mind. She'd walk around campus saying, "aloha," to her fellow students and carry a straw basket. The wave rode her all the way to "You Bet Your Life," the quiz show hosted by Groucho Marx. She won $500, she said.
Zuckerman keeps alive the original film's free spirit. She is in her 17th year at Duke's Malibu, where she serves as the restaurant's Ambassador of Aloha.
Hers is an odd form of celebrity. The name and face may be unfamiliar, but the name Gidget resonates with people who've read the books and seen the movies and television series.
"I live a quiet life," Zuckerman said. "I do the wifey things and the grandma things. When I'm at Duke's, they call me Gidget, and it's 'Can we take your picture?' Then I leave, and I'm Kathy."
She is a hero to the women empowered by her to try the male-dominated sport themselves. Surfer magazine ranked her No. 7 on its list of the 25 most influential people in surfing. In 2011, she was inducted into the Huntington Beach Surfing Walk of Fame.
Gidget's extended family includes Darren, who is amused that like his friend Frankie Avalon of "Beach Party" fame, two dark-haired Philadelphia boys became West Coast surfing icons.
But Darren holds a special place in film history. He is the only actor to appear in a movie franchise opposite different leads in each outing: one Moondoggie, three Gidgets. Dee also was his favorite.
"Deborah did a wonderful job, Cindy did a wonderful job, but with all due respect, Sandra Dee was ideal," he said in a phone interview. "That innocence she had, that vulnerability. That's what made her a star; you play a role that happens to be pretty much right for you, and from what you bring to that, people love you because of that role."
Which raises the question: Did he date any of his Gidgets?
"No," he said. "Sandra Dee, I loved. I would have, but she was 17 [Darren was 20]. She had a very protective mom. When she and I appeared on Sally Jessy Raphael's talk show together [in 1991], I told her I was in love with her, and she said, 'Why didn't you tell me then?' "
The film made Darren an instant teen idol and singing star (the studio wanted to dub his voice for the songs, but he convinced them he could sing them). He recalled a riotous reception in San Francisco when he appeared on a TV teen music show.
"A group of teenage girls came through the glass doors of the studio and they pulled me outside and had me pinned to the pavement and started pulling hair out of my head," he recalled. "The police rescued me."
Darren went on to be associated with other projects with their own obsessive fan bases. He costarred in the Irwin Allen sci-fi series "The Time Tunnel," appeared opposite William Shatner in "T.J. Hooker" and played holographic lounge singer Vic Fontaine on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine."
But in his one-man stage show, it is the portion devoted to "Gidget," he said, that gets the most rapturous response across all ages.
As for the real-life Gidget, the sun continues to shine on Zuckerman, who kept diaries of her surfing years that she's now shopping to publishers.
"I'm healthy, I can see the stars, I'm about two seconds from the beach," she said. "Once a surfer, always a surfer. I'm still here, and I am Gidget."

Texto completo: Valentina Cortese, the stunning, Italian-born actress who achieved international fame in Europe and Hollywood during a five-decade career, has died at the age of 96.
The film and theater star died Wednesday in Milan, Italian news agency ANSA reported.
"With the passing of Valentina Cortese, Italian show business loses that last diva of cinema and theater," said Carlo Fontana, head of the Italian Show Business Association.
Cortese (photo) was among the most glamorous Italian actresses of her era, which included Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida.
She launched her career at the height of World War II in her homeland with "The Jester's Supper" and "Les Miserables," which featured a young Marcello Mastroianni. She made her Hollywood splash in "The House on Telegraph Hill," in which she played a Polish Holocaust survivor who steals the identity of a dead prisoner to make her way to America.
During filming, she fell in love with co-star Richard Basehart and married him in 1951.
Later, she became disenchanted with movie making, blaming herself for a lack of enthusiasm.
"Darling, it's my fault, because I could have done much for myself," she told The New York Times in 1974. "But I never followed the rules. I was a nonconformist."
Cortese never shied from appearing in more experimental fare, such as 1972's "Brother Sun, Sister Moon," 1977's "Jesus of Nazareth" and 1988's "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen."

Texto completo: DAMARISCOTTA — Skidompha Library’s Chats with Champions will feature Arlie Russell Hochschild at 10 a.m. Thursday in the Skidompha Library’s Porter Meeting Hall on Main Street. Please allow time for parking.
Hochschild is a renowned professor emerita of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her Chat with Champions at the library will focus on her latest title, “Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right,” a New York Times Best Seller and finalist for the 2016 National Book Award, according to a news release from the library.
In an era in which most of us live in our own “political bubble,” Hochschild dared to venture from liberal Democratic Berkeley, California, to conservative Republican Lake Charles, Louisiana. By the time Donald Trump had won election to the United States Presidency in 2016, Hochschild had spent five years immersed in the “deep story” of a nation grappling with its identity. Her Chat with Champions will unpack the political trends that elected Trump and offer solutions for moving forward.

At Arekie, Spain meets India — in one colorful food truck

Texto completo: Sushma and Monish Mansharamani have been blessed with good culinary DNA.
Sushma is from Spain, while Monish hails from India. The pair bring these two unique and flavorful styles of cooking to the blended menu of their new food truck, Arekie Fusion Cuisine. "We are food people," Sushma said. "I love cooking."
The concept for their fused-flavors food truck came about one night as Sushma cooked dinner. She had prepared arepas, the South American dough patty made from ground corn. She'd also made butter chicken, a classic Indian dish from Monish's family.
She thought to herself: Why not mix the two? So, she filled the arepas with the butter chicken, and her particular brand of fusion fare was born. "It was super yummy," she said. "So I said to myself, 'Let me go ahead and make something else.'"
Sushma tried more and more fusion dishes, blending her Spanish and Latin roots with Indian dishes from Monish's heritage. The results gained rave reviews from friends. Soon Sushma and Monish started talking about launching their own eatery. In June their food truck made its Southwest Florida debut at Millennial Brewing Co. in downtown Fort Myers.
"So many people came, and they were amazed with the food," Sushma said.
"They were coming back to the truck saying, 'Hey, where are you going to be next?'"
Arekie's first run was such a success that it sold out that night. Its menu, though small, features unique dishes from several main categories. The first is a bread and filling option where customers choose between four types of bread and four vegetable or meat options to go with it.
For the bread, Arekie offers the Frankie roll, which is an Indian flatbread; the arepa, made form corn flour; and naan, a soft Indian flatbread. Fillings include egg and chorizo, chicken tikka, butter chicken or a vegan blend of curried potatoes, roasted cauliflower, chickpeas, spinach, cilantro mint chutney and pickled onions.
Arekie also runs a weekly special, which right now is the butter chicken platter with basmati rice and buttered naan. It also has empanadas stuffed with chicken tikka, samosas and masala fritas, waffle-cut chips seasoned in Indian spices. "This is just the starting menu," Sushma said. "Soon we will have more empanadas and different fillings."
The truck also has unique drinks, including the classic mango lassi and sharbat, a refreshing blend of rose water and fresh juices. Arekie offers an array of desserts, as well. When choosing a format for serving their Latin-Indian fusion, the Mansharamanis opted for a food truck instead of a brick-and-mortar location because they wanted to reach all of Southwest Florida. "Sometimes it's difficult when you have a store somewhere," Sushma said. "People don't want to travel. So, instead of them driving to us, we go to them."
Arekie is already booked for the next four months at breweries, corporate offices and private events. For those looking to track down the fusion truck, the couple updates the Arekie website as well as its social media pages every day with upcoming venues.
The truck has events scheduled in Naples, Estero, Fort Myers and Cape Coral. "Every week, everybody can taste the fusion cuisine," Suhsma said. "It's mouthwatering. It's amazing."

The media found its new Democratic darling for 2020: Amy McGrath

Texto completo: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has a Democratic challenger!
In a campaign announcement video, Amy McGrath told a story about when she was 13 years old, she wrote a letter to McConnell about becoming a woman fighter pilot and serving her country. She said that letter was ignored and that McConnell has been ignoring Kentuckians for years.
McGrath has a storied military career as a former Marine fighter pilot that includes flying 89 combat missions bombing al Qaeda and the Taliban. If her career in the military was that stellar, surely she’d do well in politics, right? Well, not exactly.
McGrath ran for Congress in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District and lost against Republican Rep. Andy Barr in 2018, even though she outraised and outspent Barr by more than $3 million, in the second-most Democratic district in the state.
Now, she's running statewide in a presidential year in a state Trump carried by 30 points. Nevertheless, she still got a gushy TV spot with MSNBC’s Morning Joe.
Co-host Mika Brzezinski called McGrath's campaign announcement "an incredible rollout," while frequent panelist Mike Barnicle called it "incredibly powerful," asking her how her supporters can donate to her campaign by asking for her website.
New York Times reporter Trip Gabriel even likened McGrath to Luke Skywalker taking on McConnell’s Darth Vader.

Given McConnell's unpopularity with the press, it's pretty clear that coverage will favor McGrath throughout this race — even if the odds don't.Story URLPhoto Caption:Amy McGrath speaks to supporters.

Connecticut Catholic bishops call for immigration reform

Texto completo: The U.S. government has dishonored “the basic humanity of migrants and refugees” because it has failed to pass immigration reform, according to a letter issued Wednesday by the Catholic bishops of Connecticut.
Blaming both political parties for a lack of action, the bishops urged action on “a complete overhaul of existing immigration policies,” according to the letter. “Those responsible in government need to undertake an examination of conscience as to what they have done and have failed to do when it comes to respect for human persons and the enactment of fair and balanced legislation,” the bishops wrote.
According to the New York Times, Customs and Border Protection officials counted 104,344 migrants at the U.S.-Mexican border in June, down from a 13-year high of 144,278 in May. The bishops wrote that “most recently we were confronted with the tragic images of the drowning deaths of Óscar Martinez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, who were fleeing the dangers of El Salvador for the safety of the United States.”
They added that immigrants “have been captured and are now detained in overcrowded conditions” because of “political gridlock” and that an average of 357 immigrants die each year on the Southwest border. This bishops said other nations “need to be encouraged and aided” to “remedy the conditions that force people to flee their homeland.”
The letter was signed by Archbishop Leonard P. Blair and Auxiliary Bishop Juan Miguel Betancourt of the Archdiocese of Hartford, Bishop Frank J. Caggiano of the Diocese of Bridgeport, Bishop Michael R. Cote of the Diocese of Norwich, all Roman Catholics, and Bishop P. Paul Chomnycky of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford. All four dioceses are members of the Connecticut Catholic Public Affairs Conference.

Artificial eyeballs and a life-size doll

Texto completo: There's a life-size doll hanging from a chandelier and a hallway covered in artificial eyeballs in the mansion of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. We'll get to that in a second. It’s Ashley. Here’s Wednesday's biggest news.
But first, can this ��trend stop? First the “ice cream licker. ” Now, this Florida woman doing some real nasty stuff to ice cream. I'm about to go full Reese Witherspoon on the next person who tries this.
A life-size doll hanging from a chandelier and a new accuser
Federal agents who searched the mansion of wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein turned up a "vast trove of lewd photographs" of young-looking girls, including hundreds of meticulously labeled nude pictures locked in a safe, according to federal court documents. The memo was aimed at convincing a federal judge that Epstein should not be freed pending trial on charges of sex trafficking. The memo said the search turned up "hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females.

Underage migrants report sexual abuse and poor conditions
Underage migrants held at the Border Patrol's facilities in Yuma, Arizona, reported poor conditions, as well as allegations of misconduct and sexual abuse at the hands of U. S. border agents. The accusations appear in reports compiled by case managers working for the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes custody of migrant youths after they've been processed at the U. S. -Mexican border, NBC News reported Tuesday. The accusations, the first to come out of Arizona, surfaced amid scrutiny on the federal government's treatment of migrants at the border.

Trump's Fourth of July celebration drained DC's security fund, mayor says
Remember that big ol’ Fourth of July extravaganza Trump threw last week? I mean, how could you forget all those tanks sitting around? Well, apparently, it was a little costly for the District of Columbia: Mayor Muriel Bowser said Tuesday that the costs emptied a municipal fund used to secure public events and defend against terrorist threats. The city spent about $1. 7 million on Trump's "July 4th holiday activities and subsequent First Amendment demonstrations," Bowser said, and as a result, the fund will probably be empty before the end of the year.
Considering dying your hair purple?
The U. S. women’s soccer team got a hero’s celebration for winning their fourth World Cup title, honored with a ticker tape parade in New York.

Chants of "EQUAL PAY, EQUAL PAY" roared as the procession passed. More celebrations will follow: Rapinoe accepted a team invitation to celebrate with a visit to Congress.

Texto completo: "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune," Terrence McNally's two-hander about wounded romantics in a one-night stand, will close on July 28, producers announced on Monday.
Despite featuring the six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald and the two-time Oscar nominee Michael Shannon in the title roles, the show will close nearly a month earlier than planned. After opening May 30 as the first production of the 2019-20 season, it will have played 70 performances and 26 previews.
"Time has been good to 'Frankie and Johnny,' " Jesse Green wrote in his New York Times Critic's Pick review. "Its sentimentality hasn't curdled the way it has in some of Mr. McNally's many other plays."
The box office wasn't as good. For the week ending July 7, the production was the lowest grossing on Broadway, earning $ 231,745, just 20 percent of its potential take. The show was capitalized for up to $ 4.1 million, according to securities documents, costs it will not recoup.
"Frankie and Johnny" had its Off Broadway premiere in 1987, and was presented on Broadway for the first time in 2002, with Stanley Tucci and Edie Falco, running for more than 200 performances.
While this rendition's run will be brief, it has made Broadway history as the first show to use an "intimacy director" to help stage sex scenes and nudity.
Claire Warden handled that task, working with the actors and the director Arin Arbus, making her own Broadway debut.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

NJ Transit canceled more than 60 trains in the last week

Texto completo: New Jersey Transit, the country's third-busiest commuter railroad and an essential link to New York City, is not running out of excuses for failing to run its trains. It's recycling them.
Last week, the railroad canceled more than 60 trains, many of them during the morning or evening rush hours, leaving thousands of commuters scrambling to find other ways of getting to work or home.
In fact, canceled trains have become a near daily occurrence, and many frustrated riders wonder if they will ever be able to depend on the service.
In many cases, New Jersey Transit has blamed the failures on a persistent shortage of crews to operate the trains. In most others, the problem is what officials call "equipment availability," which means the railroad did not have all the trains available it needed to carry riders.
If those explanations sound familiar to regular riders, that is because New Jersey Transit has used them before. They were often cited last year when the agency struggled to maintain its schedule after paring it back and suspending service on two rail lines for several months.
But New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, and his appointees have been promising since early 2018 that they would solve New Jersey Transit's problems through increased funding and better management.
They say they have made big strides, but commuters remain unconvinced.
"I haven't noticed anything improving," said Emma Zielinski, who said her usual train home was canceled all three times she tried to ride it last week. "Commuting with N.J. Transit is a disorganized, chaotic nightmare."
The first, on Monday, was caused by a fire in an Amtrak work train that suspended some evening service on the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor line, New Jersey Transit said. Her train failed to make its run south from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan the next two nights because of "equipment availability," the agency said.
Zielinski, 31, said she had no viable alternative for commuting to her home in Princeton, New Jersey. She already abandoned a two-stop rail shuttle, known as the Dinky, that connects Princeton and Princeton Junction, where riders can take the train to New York.
She rode the shuttle for a couple of years until New Jersey Transit suspended the service last summer. Now she drives to the Princeton Junction station and pays to park there.
"It just became too much to rely on both trains to be on time and actually working," she said.
New Jersey Transit official's insist the problem is not an actual shortage of trains, just difficulties getting trains in place because of a lack of engineers.
They emphasize that cancellations have been less frequent this year than last and that the railroad's performance appears to be improving. In the past few months, its trains have been running on time more often than last year, when performance sank.
Last year truly was an annus horribilis for New Jersey Transit.
On top of its crew shortage, it was saddled with a pressing deadline to equip all its locomotives with the technology for an automatic braking system known as Positive Train Control. The need to take those engines out of service for the installation forced the railroad to reduce its schedule, including the suspension of service on the Atlantic City Line and the Dinky.
At the end of the year, though, New Jersey Transit was sending out news releases announcing that it had completed that part of the installation. In May, it restored the suspended service.
By late June, Murphy was proclaiming that the agency had made "enormous progress," fueled in part by a large increase in direct funding from the state. At a news conference, the governor promised, "You'll see a quantum increase, I think, by the fourth quarter of this year."
Kevin Corbett, who runs New Jersey Transit, was more measured in his optimism. Corbett pegged significant improvement to the recruitment and training of more engineers to drive the trains. The railroad has about 330 engineers and aims to add more than 50 by early next year.
A class of 12 trainees finished in May, and 11 of them are now working as engineers, said Nancy Snyder, a spokeswoman for the agency. Three more classes are scheduled to complete training by January.
"When we get into next year, we'll be at the level we need to be to provide all service and have an ample bench," Corbett said.
That may not be soon enough for riders.
On Twitter, one rider who comments regularly about frustrations with New Jersey Transit wrote last Wednesday that most of her trips had been overcrowded, forcing her to "stand, smashed like a sardine, for FIVE of these commutes, most of which were not my normal trains because of cancellations or lateness."
"In what world is this ok!?" she added.

Justice Department pressures two Mueller deputies to refuse testifying

Autor: Chaitin, Daniel.

Texto completo: The Justice Department is privately discouraging two of special counsel Robert Mueller's top deputies from testifying before Congress.
Aaron Zebley and James Quarles III have tentatively agreed to answer questions from the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees behind closed doors. But the Justice Department has informed both panels of its opposition to testimony from Zebley and Quarles and have also channeled this message to the pair of prosecutors, according to the New York Times.
A DOJ spokesperson did not immediately return the Washington Examiner's request for comment.
Both Zebley, a close associate to Mueller, and Quarles, who focused on the obstruction portion of the Russia investigation, have retired from the DOJ and are private citizens, so the agency can only pressure them to bow out.
The news comes about a week ahead of Mueller's back-to-back public testimony before the two Democrat-led committees following a pair of subpoenas from Chairmen Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler. During a recent interview with CNN, Schiff said there will also be an "executive session" with members of Mueller's staff.
In an interview with Fox News, Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed concern about what one of Mueller's top prosecutors might say in a closed setting as part of the deal to speak to lawmakers.
"Now what's off about this is, supposedly he's only agreed to testify for four hours. Four hours with the House Intelligence Committee and the House Judiciary Committee is not enough time to get everyone’s questions in," Nunes said. "In addition, people should know he’s not willing to testify as of now behind closed doors and he’s supposedly going to send in Andrew Weissmann and his team of geniuses that came up with these conspiracy theories. And that’s not even going to be translated. So stay tuned."
Although Attorney General William Barr has said he is fine with Mueller testifying, he accused the Democrats of trying to “create some kind of public spectacle" in an interview with the New York Times on Monday.
Delivering his only public statement so far on the Russia investigation at the end of May, Mueller indicated he had no desire to testify about his work, let alone do it publicly. "The report is my testimony," he said.
Still, Schiff, who hails from California, is focusing his criticism on Barr, not Mueller. “Earlier when he said it is completely up to Bob Mueller whether he testifies, he was counting on Bob Mueller not wanting to testify and not be compelled to,” Schiff said. “But now I think his real motivation is exposed. He is nothing if not transparent and transparently the president’s agent.”
Mueller's report, released in April with redactions, shows his team was not able to establish criminal conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, but left open the question of possible obstruction of justice. The report laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to make a determination on the matter, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.
Although Trump and his allies say the case is closed, Democrats argue Mueller's refusal to clear Trump on obstruction provides them a road map to continue to investigate and possibly seek impeachment. Barr said he and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined there was not sufficient evidence to establish that a crime had occurred.Story URLPhoto Caption:Attorney Aaron Zebley arrives at the Phillip Burton Federal Building in San Francisco, Thursday, April 21, 2016.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Rep. Ayanna Pressley on Tuesday criticized Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Donald Trump, after Conway mocked bickering between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and four female freshman Democrats as a "major meow moment. "
". @KellyannePolls oh hi Distraction Becky. Remember that time your boss tore babies from their mothers’ arms and threw them in cages?" Pressley, D-Mass. , tweeted. "Yeah take a seat and keep my name out of your lying mouth. "
Becky is a slang term that often refers to a basic or generic white woman.
Pressley was reacting to a tweet from Conway that said: "Major Meow Mashup with @SpeakerPelosi brushing back anti-humanitarian border aid fresh-women @AOC @IlhanMN @AyannaPressley @RashidaTlaib"
'A moral imperative': AOC, Bernie Sanders call for climate emergency declaration
More: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib fire back at Nancy Pelosi's 'Twitter world' quip
Several days ago, Speaker Pelosi criticized Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. , Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. , and Pressley for voting against emergency border aid funding, according to an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.
"All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world," Pelosi said, according to the New York Times. "But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got. "
Since then, Ocasio-Cortez, Omar and Tlaib have fired back at Pelosi's comment.
"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. "And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. "
Tuesday morning, Conway said that Pelosi was brushing back at the four freshman Democratic lawmakers.
“A major meow moment — brushing back in a huge catfight, really ridiculing them — and they voted against the Democratic aid package," Conway said in an interview with Fox News.

Rich Lowry: Ballparks highlighted in Goldberger book

Texto completo: We live in an era of public ugliness, of architects who deliberately make their forms unsightly and inhuman, and of public art installations that are invariably ridiculous.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://i0.wp.com/multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color.jpg?resize=300%2C293&ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="293" data-recalc-dims="1" />
The most obvious exception is the ballpark, which has gotten more beautiful rather than less in a great example of renewal through a return to tradition.
Paul Goldberger, a former architecture writer for The New York Times, traces this journey in his wonderful new book “Ballpark.”
He rightly calls the ballpark “one of the greatest of all American building types” and argues that “as much as the town square, the street, the park, and the plaza, the baseball park is a key part of American public space.”
Ballparks went from delightfully peculiar structures shoehorned into city streets, to monochromatic multiuse facilities with all the charm of public-works projects, before rediscovering the old forms.
The first ballpark was built in Brooklyn in 1862 and called “Union Grounds.” Amazingly enough, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” not yet the national anthem, was played before the first game. The wooden parks of the 19th century tended to burn down, sometimes spectacularly (a fire at the South End Grounds in Boston took out 200 buildings in Roxbury).
The 20th century brought the age of steel, brick and concrete, and “the Golden Age” of 1912-14. It gave us Crosley Field, where the Reds played until 1970, with an upward slope known as the “terrace” in left field; Tiger Stadium, quirky and cozy (a flagpole stood in the field of play in deep center); and especially the “jewel boxes” of Fenway, Wrigley and Ebbets.
They had in common eccentricities owing to where they were built, and an extraordinary intimacy. Some of their signature features didn’t come until later. The famous Green Monster and the “Dartmouth Green” paint of the interior of Fenway arrived with renovations. Wrigley didn’t get its iconic ivy walls until the 1930s.
Subsequent decades brought a flight from cities, and from idiosyncrasy. Cleveland previewed what was to come in the 1930s with its publicly funded, gargantuan, usually half-empty, symmetrical, multisport Municipal Stadium, or the “Mistake by the Lake.”
The truly dreadful, indistinguishable concrete doughnuts, made for football and baseball but manifestly unsuited for the latter, arrived beginning in the 1960s.
The turning point was Camden Yards in Baltimore, opened in 1992. Originally conceived as another multisport suburban facility, it instead decisively moved baseball beyond such hybrids. A decision at the outset to keep a nostalgic-feeling old Baltimore & Ohio Railroad red-brick warehouse intact at the site of the new park usefully pointed to the past.
Camden Yards has a red-brick exterior and exposed steel supports inside, eschewing the concrete of the doughnuts. It limits foul territory to bring ground-level seats closer. The stands are arranged asymmetrically to avoid a deadening sameness, and frame a view of the Baltimore skyline, anchoring the park in the city.
It was such a triumph that its retro style has become a design cliche. Its influence stamped the best of the new parks: PNC Park in Pittsburgh, which, outside of Fenway and Wrigley, might be the most charming place to watch a game in the country; Oracle Park in San Francisco, which is everything its execrable forebear, Candlestick, wasn’t; T-Mobile Park in Seattle, which is enchanting despite a retractable roof.
They all are distinctive and tethered to a specific city. They are all pleasing and humane, as good architecture always is. And they are wholly devoted to baseball — still and all, the most American game.
Goldberger writes of how the ballpark, with its lush field at the center of an enclosure of concrete and steel, is the garden in the city, a sports combination of the Jeffersonian agrarian tradition and the Hamiltonian emphasis on cities and industry.
It’s a wonder we managed to mess it up, but we did, before the current revival that shows there’s always a way back.

Texto completo: A group of immigrant workers fired from President Donald Trump's golf clubs say they want to meet with him at the White House to make the case that they should not be deported.
The 21 maids, groundskeepers and other workers fired earlier this year from five of Trump's clubs asked their former employer in a letter this week to remember all their hard work and give them a chance to make their case in person why they should stay in the country. At least one of those workers was at Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Stormville.
"I'm hopeful that he'll look at the letter. I believe he has a heart," said Gabriel Sedano, who worked for 14 years as a handyman at Trump's club in Briarcliff Manor before he was fired in January.
He was one of a dozen immigrant workers who were fired that month.
The response on White House stationery Wednesday, in what appeared to be a form letter, assured the workers that "we are reviewing your message." The White House didn't respond Friday to a request for further comment.
The troubles for Trump workers started in December when a maid who had made the president's bed at his club in Bedminster, New Jersey, told The New York Times that a supervisor there knew she and other housekeepers and workers were in the country illegally, and used their status against them if they complained about working conditions.
Then other workers at other Trump clubs without proper documents — some employed by him for a decade or more — began speaking out, and the Trump Organization began rounds of firings.
One of those was Juan Quintero, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. Anibal Romero, a lawyer for 39 former Trump workers, including Quintero, said Quintero had been fired from Trump's Stormville property in January.
Quintero had worked at the club for 18 years tending the golf course, Romero said. He was hired by the previous management of the property, before Trump purchased it in December 2009 and changed its name from Branton Woods Golf Club.
The Trump Organization has said it does not tolerate workers who lie about their status and only recently discovered its workers were in the country illegally. It did not respond to requests for comment about the proposed White House meeting.
Democrats in Congress requested earlier this year that the FBI look into whether the Trump Organization acted as a "criminal enterprise" by knowingly hiring workers with false documents and even helping them procure such papers, as some fired workers have claimed.
Romero said he has been interviewed by the FBI as well as the offices of attorneys general in New Jersey and New York, though he declined to talk about what was discussed.
The letter from the workers said the president knows many of them and asked him to "do the right thing" and "not deport us and our friends and family."
"You know we are hard workers and that we are not criminals or seeking a free ride in America," the letter said. "We all pay our taxes, love our faith and our family, and simply want to find a place for ourselves to make America even better."
Former club handyman Sedano said he couldn't believe it when he was fired in January because he was a trusted employee who was asked to do work on Eric Trump's house nearby, and given access to come and go as he pleased.
"I had keys to the house, all the codes. I knew him personally," said Sedano, who has three children in the U.S., the youngest 8. He added: "I was the first one fired. There was a list. I was the first one."

Small churches pay off millions in medical debt

Texto completo: "Sometimes the more powerful spiritual message is when you're able to do something for somebody that you'll never meet."
Larry Wren
Pathway Church
The leaders of Pathway Church on the outskirts of Wichita, Kansas, had no clue the $22,000 they had on hand for Easter would have such impact.
The nondenominational, suburban congregation of about 3,800 set out to help people nearby pay off some medical debt, recalled Larry Wren, Pathway's executive pastor. After all, the core membership at Pathway's three sites consists of middle-income families with school-age kids, not high-dollar philanthropists.
Then they learned that, like a modern-day loaves-and-fishes story, that smaller amount could wipe out $2.2million in debt not only for the Wichita area but all available debt for every Kansan facing imminent insolvency because of medical expenses they couldn't afford to pay – 1,600 people in all.
"Being able to do this provides an opportunity to illustrate what it means to have a debt paid that they could never pay themselves," he said. "It just was a great fit."
How it works Churches in Maryland, Illinois, Virginia, Texas and elsewhere have reached the same conclusion. RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit organization based in Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs, reported a surge in participation from primarily Christian places of worship. Eighteen have worked with RIP in the past year and a half, said Scott Patton, the group's director of development. More churches are joining.
The mountain of bills they are trying to clear is high. Medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. A Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll in 2018 showed that of the 26% of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59% reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.
The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau proposed a rule in May to curb debt collectors' ability to bug those with outstanding bills, and some states have tried various measures, such as limiting the interest rates collectors may charge. Until a comprehensive solution emerges, churches and others are trying to ease some of the load by jumping into the debt market.
A big part of RIP's appeal comes from the impact even a small donation can have, church leaders said. When a person can't pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people's debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. Those debts usually come from low-income people and are more difficult to collect.
RIP buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors. Instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.
To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must earn less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual), have debts that are 5% or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.
Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap. That's how, Patton said, those 18 churches were able to abolish $34.4 million of debt since the start of 2018.
Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of about 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.
The message spreads Revolution leaders heard about RIP Medical Debt on a segment of John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight" in 2016, said Kenny Camacho, lead pastor. At the time, they didn't think they had the resources to make much of a splash.
After hearing about another church that paid off millions last year, Revolution leaders decided to try it. At most, they hoped to have an impact in their area, Camacho said. The money went much further, covering 14 counties in eastern and central Maryland.
Emmanuel Memorial Episcopal Church, a congregation of about 175 families in Champaign, Illinois, had a similar experience. The original idea was to try to have an impact just in Champaign County, said the Rev. Christine Hopkins. The church's $15,000 abolished $4 million of debt for the entire diocese, which stretches across the southern half of the state.
"We were bowled over, actually," she said. "It was to the point of tears."
In many cases, churches have not had to do a fundraising campaign because their contribution came from money already on hand. Emmanuel Episcopal had leftovers from a campaign set up a year ago to celebrate the centennial of its church building.
The Fincastle Baptist Church, which has 1,600 members in the Roanoke, Virginia, area, used money it had budgeted for an annual "Freedom Fest" event to honor first responders, then partnered with television station WSLS in a telethon to raise more. That effort abolished more than $2.7 million in medical debt targeted at veterans.
RIP allows donors to choose geographic areas they want to reach and can pinpoint veterans as recipients. Beyond that, no restrictions are allowed, Patton said.
A church can't specify which types of medical procedures could be paid for or anything about the background of the recipients.
The subject has been broached by some potential donors, Patton said.
Some asked to exclude people from different faiths or certain political parties, he said. "It's just absurd. This is not a revenge tactic," Patton said. "People who are requesting those things really don't understand philanthropy."
Anonymous giving Churches don't necessarily experience a direct return in the way of new members. All the processing goes through RIP Medical Debt, which sends letters notifying the beneficiaries their debts have been forgiven. Donors can have their names listed on those letters, but not everyone opts to do so.
New membership wasn't the point for Pathway Church in Kansas, Wren said. "Sometimes the more powerful spiritual message is when you're able to do something for somebody that you'll never meet," he said.
Revolution Annapolis decided against putting its name on the notification letters, Camacho said, because it didn't want beneficiaries to feel obligated. "When a person has their debt forgiven, we want them to experience that as a kind of no-strings-attached gift," he said. "We don't want there to be any sense that because we did this, now they should visit our church or something."
Donors sometimes hear back from the people whose debts they've paid, but not often. Many don't expect it.
"I guess that's a biblical story, too. Jesus forgave 10, and only one said thank you," Hopkins said.
Kaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
"Sometimes the more powerful spiritual message is when you're able to do something for somebody that you'll never meet."

Mirroring Trump Could Doom the Democrats; They need a moderate alternative. If Biden declines to step up, others may do so.

Texto completo: The only cure for bad politics is better politics. The only remedy for national division is national leadership that puts reconciliation first.
Many observers—including some of my close friends—believe that the better politics America needs will emerge from below. Local government will model cooperative problem-solving across the lines that divide us. Civil society will reconnect individuals whose isolation leads them toward extremism. Service to others will give new purpose to those now inclined to seek meaning in intense partisanship. Creative new programs will ameliorate what political scientists call "affective polarization"—in plain English, the loathing with which too many partisans now regard those on the other side.
These approaches can help. But they will not get the job done. Unless Americans are given better political options, they cannot make better choices.
For the moment, no vision to bridge our divisions is likely to come from the Republican Party. President Trump's supporters prize him as a fighter, not a unifier. We do not see "Bring us together again" signs at his rallies. Moreover, every survey shows that he commands overwhelming support from members of his party. It is hardly surprising that no one of stature has come forth to challenge his renomination. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, we can expect more of the same.
As often happens, politics has mirrored physics: An action generated an equal and opposite reaction. Candidates for the Democratic nomination are espousing positions that would have been unthinkable not long ago and that are more likely to repel than attract the swing voters who gave them a House majority in 2018.
As the fight for their party's presidential nomination intensifies, Democrats will have to answer some tough questions. With conservative activists pushing to overturn Roe v. Wade, does it make sense to loosen the current limits on abortion, which are grounded in the architecture of the 1973 decision? As the Trump administration undermines the Affordable Care Act, is advocating a government takeover of the entire health-care system the wisest course?
The Trump administration's tactics on immigration are unacceptable, and the president's rhetoric is even worse. Does this mean Democrats should favor decriminalizing unauthorized entry into the country? Must the country choose between open borders and the administration's cruelty, as Julián Castro asserts?
As I've argued in this space, the comprehensive immigration-reform bill of 2013 enjoyed bipartisan support, and there's still widespread approval for its core elements: stronger border enforcement, a path to citizenship for current undocumented immigrants, and a shift to skills-based admission criteria. What these policies lack is the explicit support of a Democratic candidate who could make a case for them, which must include a defense on both the merits and the politics. Without a full-throated defense, this balanced approach to immigration would be dismissed by the left as a timid capitulation to President Trump. The same goes for every issue contested among Democrats.
As the front-runner and an avowed supporter of bipartisanship, Joe Biden has an opportunity to make this case in a way that gains public attention. So far, he has tried to stay out of intraparty battles, preferring to attack Mr. Trump. Although the short-term benefits of this stance are clear, it is not the best basis for waging an effective presidential campaign against an incumbent who is prepared to tar the Democratic nominee with a very broad brush.
If the former vice president is not willing to step forward, he will create an opening for others who are prepared to be bolder. For example, Sen. Michael Bennet was an author of the 2013 immigration bill and continues to defend it. He rejects Medicare for All in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act with a public option, which he does not regard as a way station to a single-payer system. He is one of the few candidates to reject Mr. Castro's demand to decriminalize unauthorized entry.
Asked by the New York Times whether anyone deserves to have a billion dollars, Mr. Bennet responded, "People in a capitalist country are going to have a billion dollars." The real issue, he said, is the decline in economic mobility, without which democracy cannot survive. And he tartly dismisses the proposal, discussed by Pete Buttigieg and others, to expand the Supreme Court to 15 justices: "I think it would meet the same fate as when Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the court," he says.
Now Mr. Bennet has the chance to make the case for the kind of politics his positions reflect. Others—including Amy Klobuchar, John Delaney, Steve Bullock and John Hickenlooper, if his campaign survives—have a similar opportunity.
The positions the Democratic left is pushing would be a very hard sell in a general election. The 2020 Democratic platform could turn out to be the longest suicide note ever. And a chance to begin healing our fractured politics would be lost.

In politics, Trump is a lucky man

Texto completo: The day after his dismal showing in the first Democratic debates, former Vice President Joe Biden said in Chicago: "Folks, the discussion in this race shouldn’t be about the past." He’s right, of course. American politics is always about the future. But Biden doesn’t take his own advice. The candidate and his surrogates seem obsessed with talking about his resume: 36 years in the Senate, eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president. The effect is to reinforce his advanced age — he’ll be 78 on Inauguration Day 2021 — and his disconnection from current trends and topics.
Even as a younger and more vigorous figure, Biden was a deeply flawed presidential candidate in 1988 and 2008. And all his weaknesses, aggravated by age, were on full display during the debate in Miami. A post-debate poll by CNN saw him dropping 10 points, from 32% to 22%, while two younger female senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, surged upward.
Here’s the huge and growing problem staring Democrats in the face: Biden might be a miscast messenger, but his political position as a pragmatic progressive gives the party its best chance of defeating Donald Trump. If the Democrats abandon the middle ground and veer too far to the left, they are doomed to four more years of Trump in the White House and a generation of conservative justices dominating the Supreme Court. The debates in Miami showed that’s exactly where the party is headed. On a range of issues from immigration and health care to tax rates and climate change, the loudest voices espoused policies far outside the American mainstream. Rick Tyler, a conservative Republican strategist, accurately summed up the main lesson coming out of the Democratic debates for The Washington Post: "They are not talking to the blue-collar workers that I understand that vote in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Are they seriously capable of choosing a nominee who is going to beat Donald Trump? Right now I have my doubts." The Wall Street Journal editorial page was even pithier when its editors wrote: "President Donald Trump is a lucky man."
Only 26% of Americans call themselves liberals. And their voting power is even less than that, because they tend to cluster in urban areas and coastal states. Trump’s base remains fervently loyal, but stuck at about 35% to 37%. His apparent strategy, maximizing the votes of his loyal followers while not reaching beyond his core support, makes little sense. But the Democrats seem determined to make the same mistake, rushing to extremes and abandoning the moderate middle. And their liberal base, about 1 in 4 voters, is even smaller than Trump’s tribe of true believers. As James Carville, a key architect of Bill Clinton’s 1992 victory, told The New York Times, "This is an election that Trump can’t win but Democrats can lose."
Democratic voters understand this. By 2 to 1, they told CNN that they prefer a candidate who can defeat Trump, as opposed to someone who shares their views on issues. And 43% still see Biden as their best hope for a victory — 30 points ahead of anybody else. But after Miami, the party faces many questions. Can Biden pull it together and reinvigorate his campaign? Is there another moderate who can effectively take up that banner? If the answer to both questions is no, the party is in deep trouble. And Trump is indeed a lucky man.

Texto completo: If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now, she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance.
Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18% of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost - if they ever had - an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Ms. Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All" and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it?" She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that." More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times - not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign - says, "waffled" regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as [Bernie] Sanders," The Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan?" Ms. Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie." Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Ms. Harris said "No, I do not" support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their" in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell and Ms. Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans - 80 million more than voted in 2016 - something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4% of whites and 9% of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Ms. Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Mr. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions - forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole" and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage."
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering" is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering - modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia." Ms. Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Texto completo: In the classic 1942 film musical "Yankee Doodle Dandy," an autograph seeker asks song-and-dance man George M. Cohan the secret of his success. "Oh," he responds, "I'm an ordinary guy who knows what ordinary guys like to see."
You could say the same for Donald Trump. Whether it's a parade featuring tanks and military aircraft, bright red "Make America Great Again" hats, or fast food at the White House to celebrate college football champs, the president has a knack appealing to ordinary guys. His unembarrassed, over-the-top patriotic displays give him something in common with Cohan, whose statue still stands over Broadway.
With this difference: When Mr. Trump gives the ordinary guy what he likes, his critics come unglued. Though the president himself offers some prime targets, rather than limit their attacks to these, so often his political foes end up attacking things ordinary people like simply because Mr. Trump likes them too.
This dynamic was on display at Washington's July 4 parade as much as the B-2 stealth bomber that soared above. Maybe you have to be a Harvard Law professor to see U.S. Army tanks in the nation's capital as a "chilling" reminder of Tiananmen Square, as Laurence Tribe tweeted. Or a New York Times editor to believe that the week of July 4 is the perfect time to drop a video op-ed under the title "Please Stop Telling Me America Is Great."
It's no surprise when celebrities like Bette Midler and Rob Reiner issue silly statements. But it's amazing to see the same from Democratic presidential candidates, whose success come November 2020 will depend on winning back some of those who voted twice for Barack Obama but went for Mr. Trump in 2016.
Now Democrats have even made Betsy Ross an issue. Right before the Fourth, Nike pulled a new line of sneakers featuring the Ross flag after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a Nike brand ambassador, told the company he thought it offensive and connected to an era of slavery. In reaction, presidential aspirant Julian Castro said he was "glad" Nike pulled the sneaker, and went on to liken the original stars and stripes to the Confederate battle flag.
Ditto for Beto O'Rourke, who praised Nike and said he is "grateful for the conversation." One wonders how many Democrats will be grateful for the conversation if, during the next debate, a moderator asks for a show of hands for all those who find Betsy Ross's flag offensive.
Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates accused the president of politicizing the parade and making it all about himself -- when they were the ones who made the parade all about Mr. Trump and politics. Even Joe Biden, who prides himself on his ordinary guy credentials, used his own July 4 speech in Iowa to denounce the Washington parade as "an event designed more to stroke [President Trump's] ego than celebrate American ideals."
Imagine how much stronger Mr. Biden would be today if he had opted for a grace note. Something along the lines of, "July 4 isn't a day for politics. I wish everyone in Washington a wonderful Independence Day parade, and God bless our men and women in uniform."
This is the Achilles' heel of today's American liberalism -- the barely disguised sense of superiority not only toward the president but toward any who support him. Hillary Clinton gave voice to this disdain when she dismissed half of Mr. Trump's supporters as not only "deplorables" but "irredeemable" as well.
It is this same sentiment that presumed a group of high-school boys from Covington, Ky., racist simply because they were wearing MAGA hats. And because the American people are benefiting from a booming economy, for some it also means rooting for a recession even if it hurts people, as comedian Bill Maher has said.
Since those first Democratic debates June 26-27, much of the focus has been on policy proposals such as eliminating private insurance or extending Medicare to all those who are in the U.S. illegally. Some wisely question whether this agenda will excite voters in the battleground states Democrats need if the party is to retake the White House.
But policy choices outside the political mainstream are part of a larger vulnerability. This past weekend, a former Journal colleague emailed to say how moved he was by the "Capital Fourth" concert broadcast on PBS after the parade, where he saw nostalgia for American achievements such as the moon landing, pride in being American, and people singing "God Bless America" without fear of the religion police. Democrats, he thought as he watched, might be underestimating the president as a culture warrior.
Perhaps, he added, what he saw in those wholesome July 4 celebrations was "the America that Trump discovered hiding in plain sight, people who responded to his MAGA message." If George M. Cohan were alive, he might have written a musical about it. President Trump is no less a showman, but those looking for his performance will find it in his re-election campaign.

Trump's love-hate relationship with Fox

Texto completo: President Trump loves Fox News, the network that boosted his presidential ambitions and has often acted as a sword and shield against his critics. And, lately, he also hates Fox News.
Such as Sunday night, when Trump dashed off a tweetstorm that slammed NBC, MSNBC, the New York Times, CNN - and Fox.
"Watching @FoxNews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings Fake News @CNN," the media critic in chief said. He added, "But @FoxNews, who failed in getting the very BORING Dem debates, is now loading up with Democrats & even using Fake unsourced @nytimes as . . . a 'source' of information . . . @FoxNews is changing fast, but they forgot the people who got them there!"
(He was referring to network stories about a Times article that revealed harrowing conditions at a U.S. border-detention facility.)
The president went on to complain about how Fox in March hired Donna Brazile, the former interim Democratic National Committee chair, as a paid pundit and how she makes appearances on Fox anchor Shepard Smith's daily program. (Brazile has never actually appeared on Smith's show.)
Trump's love-hate relationship with Fox is actually fairly consistent. Despite doling out interviews to Fox programs and hosts, despite often praising the network, and despite hiring some of its key figures for important posts in his administration, he maintains a compartmentalized vitriol. It is reserved for the network's news reporting, not for the opinion hosts who regularly praise him.
Sunday's rant wasn't Trump's first against Fox, which was instrumental in turning the reality-TV-show host into a viable political contender. In 2011, the network gave Trump a regular slot on its morning show "Fox & Friends." He used it to promote his discredited "birtherism" conspiracy against President Barack Obama and to test-drive other themes that would become part of his presidential campaign starting in 2015.
In June, he tweeted his irritation with a Fox poll that showed him losing to five Democratic candidates in 2020. ("Something weird going on at Fox," he wrote, tagging his tweet with a tweak at Fox anchor Bret Baier, "More Fake News @BretBaier.")
He raged, too, in April when Fox produced a town-hall-style program featuring Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), while taking another shot at Baier ("Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the 'audience' was so smiley and nice. Very strange.").
And in March, he slammed two of Fox's weekend anchors, throwing another elbow at Smith in the process.
At the same time, Trump has granted interviews to Fox's stable of Trump-loving hosts, including Laura Ingraham, Jeanine Pirro, "Fox & Friends's" Steve Doocy and Ainsley Earhardt, Jesse Watters, Mark Levin, Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity. The latter three practically form a shadow cabinet, offering regular private advice to the president on immigration, foreign policy and the economy.
Trump typically returns the on-air affection of the Fox hosts with bouquets of his own.
When Fox suspended Pirro for two weeks in May for comments disparaging Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), for example, Trump came to her defense, tweeting, "Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro. The Radical Left Democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the Fake News Media, is using every trick in the book to SILENCE a majority of our Country. They have all out campaigns against @FoxNews hosts who are doing too well."
And then, playing TV programmer, he added, "Fox . . . must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct. . . . The losers all want what you have, don't give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die!"
Fox News's representatives didn't respond to requests for comment Monday. But people inside and outside the network see no major break in the Fox-Trump nexus.
"I think the president still loves Fox News," said Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend who is chief executive of the conservative Newsmax news site and TV network, a smaller rival to Fox. "He thinks highly of [Fox Corp. chairman] Rupert Murdoch. He just likes to negotiate. He'll be critical when he thinks they're not being fair to him. But I don't think he's abandoning Fox or trying to undermine them."
Trump, Ruddy said, is being "situational and tactical," but the overall relationship is sound: "I think he's happy with Fox."
One person intimate with Fox's operations called the president's venting "the same ol' same ol'. Trump expects 168 hours a week of pro-coverage on Fox. A slight deviation, [and] he rattles their cage." Speaking on the condition of anonymity to not jeopardize their relationship with Fox, this person said it was likely Fox "will fall back in lockstep" as the campaign season heats up.

A different view of Trump's 'genius stuff' at Wharton

Texto completo: Despite reports, he was not first in his class at Wharton
PHILADELPHIA - James Nolan was working in the University of Pennsylvania's admissions office in 1966 when he got a phone call from one of his closest friends, Fred Trump Jr. It was a plea to help Fred's younger brother Donald Trump get into Penn's Wharton School.
"He called me and said, 'You remember my brother Donald?' Which I didn't," Nolan, 81, said in an interview with The Washington Post. "He said: 'He's at Fordham and he would like to transfer to Wharton. Will you interview him?' I was happy to do that."
Soon, Donald Trump arrived at Penn for the interview, accompanied by his father, Fred Trump Sr., who sought to "ingratiate" himself, Nolan said.
Nolan, who said he was the only admissions official to talk to Donald Trump, was required to give Trump a rating, and, he recalled, "it must have been decent enough to support his candidacy."
For decades, Trump has cited his attendance at what was then called the Wharton School of Finance as evidence of his intellect. He has said he went to "the hardest school to get into, the best school in the world," calling it "super genius stuff." Last month, President Trump pointed to his studies there as he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative economist Arthur Laffer.
But Trump, who questioned the academic standing of then-President Barack Obama, has never released records showing how he got into the school - or how he performed once he was there. And, until now, Nolan's detailed account of Trump's admission process has not been publicly disclosed.
Nolan, who spoke to The Post recently at his apartment here, said that "I'm sure" the family hoped he could help get Trump into Wharton. The final decision rested with Nolan's boss, who approved the application and is no longer living, according to Nolan.
While Nolan cannot say whether his role was decisive, it was one of a string of circumstances in which Trump had a fortuitous connection, including the inheritance from his father that enabled him to build his real estate business and a diagnosis of bone spurs that provided a medical exemption from the military, by a doctor who, according to the New York Times, rented his office from Fred Trump Sr.
At the time, Nolan said, more than half of applicants to Penn were accepted, and transfer students such as Donald Trump had an even higher acceptance based on their college experience. A Penn official said the acceptance rate for 1966 was not available but noted that the school says on its website that the 1980 rate was "slightly greater than 40%." Today, by comparison, the admissions rate for the incoming Penn class is 7.4 percent, the school recently announced.
"It was not very difficult," Nolan said of the time Trump applied in 1966, adding: "I certainly was not struck by any sense that I'm sitting before a genius. Certainly not a super genius."
The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump, as a young man looking ahead to a career in real estate, viewed entry into a top college as his ticket out of the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, where his father had built housing largely aimed at the working class. But the idea of going to Penn, as his father wished, was daunting.
Indeed, Trump needed to look no further than his older brother's experience to realize the potential difficulty. Fred Trump Jr. had hoped to go to Penn with his friend Nolan. Fred Trump Jr. and Nolan were best friends, having gone to high school together and spent many hours in the Trump family home in Queens. Nolan provided The Post with a picture that shows him next to Fred Trump Jr. around the time they applied to Penn.
Nolan recalled that Trump's father never talked to him during this period, preferring the boys stay in the basement. But the plan for the boys to be roommates at Penn failed: Nolan got in, but Fred Trump Jr. was rejected. The two nonetheless remained close.
Ten years later, in 1966, it was Donald Trump who applied to Penn's Wharton School, having already attended two years at Fordham University in the Bronx, leading to the interview with Nolan. Nolan, who later became director of undergraduate admissions at Penn and now is an educational consultant, said he has not previously been quoted on the record about his role. A 2000 biography, "The Trumps," by Gwenda Blair, cited a "friendly" admissions officer who was friends with Fred Trump Jr., without identifying or quoting him. Fred Trump Jr. died in 1981.
It was common during this period for the children of wealthy and influential people to be accepted ahead of other applicants, especially if the parent made a substantial donation to the school. There is no evidence, however, of such donations in Donald Trump's case.
Records in the University of Pennsylvania archives provided to The Post do not show any donation from Fred Trump Sr. or other family members to the school during the period that Donald Trump applied for admission or was a student. However, some of the donations from that period were made anonymously, so it is not possible to say conclusively whether any Trump family donation was made. The records show donations of $1,000 or more.
The university declined to release records that would explain the decision to accept Trump, or to provide his grade transcripts, citing confidentiality restrictions.
Legend born Trump graduated from Penn in 1968. Before long, a legend was born. A 1973 article in the New York Times said Trump graduated "first in his class" from the Wharton School and then quoted his father as saying, "Donald is the smartest person I know."
The claim that Trump was the top student was repeated in a more widely noticed 1976 profile in the Times, again including his father's quote about being the "smartest person." The Times later published stories that questioned whether Trump was a top student at Penn, noting that transcripts are private.
In fact, Trump's name was not among top honorees at his commencement. Nor was he on the dean's list his senior year, meaning he was not among the top 56 students in his graduating class of 366. All that is known for certain is that Trump received at least a 2.0 average, or C, enabling him to graduate. A 4.0 is equivalent to an A.
Penn officials said they are prohibited from releasing Trump's grades unless he allows it.
Trump has said that it is crucial to evaluate a candidates' educational background to determine whether they are qualified to be president.
For example, in addition to questioning whether Obama was born in the United States, Trump said in a 2011 interview with the Associated Press that he "heard" Obama was "a terrible student, terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?"
Then he challenged Obama to release his college transcripts: "I'm certainly looking into it. Let him show his records."
Trump has not applied his standard to himself. He has declined to release his college transcripts, and during his 2016 presidential campaign his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, threatened colleges with lawsuits if his academic records were released.
The idea that Trump was the top performer has persisted partly because the president has continued to let it stand, despite the many times it has been debunked. Trump acknowledged as much last year, saying that he "heard I was first in my class at the Wharton School of Finance. And sometimes when you hear it, you don't say anything. You just let it go."
Making money The common thread in the early stories about Trump was that he had performed so well at Wharton that he was ready to take the family business to a higher level.
Yet Trump is remembered by some classmates as a middling student.
Louis Calomaris, who spent considerable time with Trump during real estate classes, said in an interview that he headed a weekly study group. Trump had attended two or three of the study sessions when, one day in class, the professor announced that the most important thing was to attend his lectures.
"Out of the corner of my eye, I see Trump close his book. And he never came to another study group, but he never missed class," Calomaris said.
He recalled Trump standing in his three-piece suit and announcing that he planned to be one of the greatest real estate developers in New York City.
Calomaris, who has worked as a business consultant and restaurateur and taught marketing at the University of Maryland, said that he thought Trump was "a bright guy" but that "he was always lazy - he wouldn't read a book. I never considered him stupid; I considered him opportunistic. . . . He cared about making money, and he knew that the most prestigious school was Wharton, and that worked with his opportunistic nature."
In a 1985 biography of Trump, Jerome Tuccille wrote that Trump hardly viewed his attendance as a priority.
"Donald agreed to attend Wharton for his father's sake," Tuccille wrote. "He showed up for classes and did what was required of him but he was clearly bored and spent a lot of time on outside business activities."
By the time Trump released his autobiography, "The Art of the Deal," in 1987, he had embraced the idea of what he called "truthful hyperbole." The key to promotion, he explained, "is bravado. I play to people's fantasies. . . . People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular."
Without addressing his class rank or the circumstances of his acceptance, Trump was blunt in his autobiography about the value he found in promoting his time at Wharton.
"Perhaps the most important thing I learned at Wharton was not to be overly impressed by academic credentials," Trump wrote. "In my opinion, that degree doesn't prove very much, but a lot of people I do business with take it very seriously, and it's considered very prestigious. So all things considered, I'm glad I went to Wharton."
Trump continues to cite his Wharton background, sometimes in misleading ways. Awarding the Medal of Freedom to Laffer on June 19, Trump claimed that "I've heard and studied the Laffer curve for many years in the Wharton School of Finance."
Trump graduated from Wharton in 1968, and Laffer did not outline his tax-cutting theory on the back of a napkin until 1974, according to Laffer's account in a book he co-wrote called "The End of Prosperity." Thus, studying the Laffer curve during Trump's time at the school would have been impossible.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - If California Sen. Kamala Harris is elected president in 2020 and reelected in 2024, by the time she leaves office 114 months from now she might have a coherent answer to the question of whether Americans should be forbidden to have what 217 million of them currently have: private health insurance. Her 22 weeks of contradictory statements, and her Trumpian meretriciousness about her contradictions, reveal a frivolity about upending health care's complex 18 percent of America's economy. And her bumblings illustrate how many of the Democratic presidential aspirants, snug in their intellectual silos, have lost - if they ever had - an aptitude for talking like, and to, normal Americans.
Seven days after announcing her candidacy in January, Harris, appearing on CNN, endorsed "Medicare for All and was asked: So, people "who like their [private] insurance, they don't get to keep it? She answered: "The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. ... Let's eliminate all of that. More government, less paperwork. Really.
She subsequently, as The New York Times - not an unsympathetic auditor of her campaign - says, "waffled regarding private insurance. But at the second Miami debate she raised her hand ("just as quickly as Mr. Sanders, the Times reported) when a moderator asked: "Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private insurance in favor of a government-run plan? Harris also raised her hand just as quickly as Sen. Elizabeth Warren had done the night before, who exclaimed "I'm with Bernie. Sen. Bernie Sanders is the purest advocate of a government-only health care system.
The next morning on MSNBC, Harris said "No, I do not support ending private health insurance, claiming that she heard the pronoun "their in the debate moderator's question (see the paragraph above) as an ungrammatical reference to each individual candidate. This alibi might be less implausible if she had not recently said, in a detailed response to a Times inquiry about her health insurance policy, that she favored abolishing private insurance.
One cannot unring a bell, and Harris cannot erase the fact that she has repeatedly said she wants to take from 217 million Americans - 80 million more than voted in 2016 - something most of them like. And she is striking at a core function of organized labor, which is to negotiate employer-provided health care as untaxed compensation.
Equally maladroit was her debate decision to wrap herself in an unpopular policy that ended 20 years ago. Nothing did more to fuel the conservative ascendancy in the 1980s than the 1970s enthusiasm of some judges and politicians for the compulsory busing of (other people's) children away from their neighborhood schools, assigning children to schools on the basis of skin color in order to engineer a desired racial balance. In a 1973 Gallup poll, just 4 percent of whites and 9 percent of blacks chose busing from among a variety of means of achieving integration.
Yet Harris chose this issue as a cudgel with which to bludgeon Joe Biden. He, evidently lacking the courage of what once supposedly were his convictions, had neither the gumption nor the mental nimbleness to ask her whether, as president, she would favor reviving the compulsory busing of children away from homes that many parents, black and white, purchased because of their proximity to desirable neighborhood schools. Biden is becoming a conviction contortionist, as with his retreat from 40 years of support for the Hyde Amendment. Suddenly he favors federal funding of abortions - forcing many taxpayers to be complicit in a practice they abhor.
Many Democrats striving to replace Donald Trump are, while execrating him, paying him the sincerest form of flattery: imitation. He prepared to campaign for president by calling America a "hellhole and he began his presidency with an inaugural address that his would-be replacements are mimicking with their versions of his trope about "American carnage.
The day the Supreme Court held that "partisan gerrymandering is not a justiciable issue, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, yet another presidential candidate, tweeted: "Make no mistake: the partisan gerrymandering SCOTUS just allowed is also racial gerrymandering - modern-day Jim Crow. Just look at what happened with Stacey Abrams last cycle in Georgia. Abrams lost a gubernatorial race. How can a statewide race be gerrymandered? How can presidential candidates be so silly?

Concentration camp expert AOC welcomes comparison of herself to Argentine Nazi sympathizer

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's perfect combination of ignorance and unflappable confidence shone forth once again this weekend as she welcomed what had been intended as an unflattering comparison between herself and famous Nazi sympathizer Evita Peron, the late first lady of Argentina.
“She’s got talent. Now, that’s the good news. The bad news: She doesn’t know anything. She’s got a good sense, an ‘it’ factor, which is pretty good, but she knows nothing. But with time, she has real potential,” Trump said of Ocasio-Cortez, according to the forthcoming book American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War.
The president added, “I called her Eva Perón. I said, ’That’s Eva Perón. That’s Evita.'”
Any ordinary person would react negatively to that comparison, knowing full well that the Perón regime knowingly sheltered Nazi war criminals, including Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann and the “Angel of Death” Josef Mengele. But Ocasio-Cortez is no ordinary person. Rather than dispute the characterization, she embraced it, tweeting out glossy, heroic-sounding quotes attributed to the late Argentine first lady.
After all, whatever Trump considers to be bad must be good, right?TweetTweetIt is possible (and most likely) Ocasio-Cortez has no idea about the dark side of the Perón legacy. Then again, it is also possible she knows full well about the regime’s efforts to harbor Nazi war criminals, and that she chose simply to react in an opposite manner to Trump because she believes all “defiance” is good even if self-defeating.
“It’s Pavlovian,” Hot Air’s Allahpundit theorizes. “Trump seems to think Evita was bad? Well, then, Evita must be good. Or at least good enough that it’s worth embracing part of her image purely for the sake of showing defiance. Defiance, always, is the key.”
At any rate, whether intentional or ignorant, the congresswoman’s embrace of the Eva Perón characterization is amusing, given her recent efforts to convince the public that she understands well the seriousness of comparing U.S. immigration detention facilities to Nazi concentration camps.
Now, as to the Perón legacy. First, there is what historians know for certain about the regime’s complicity in harboring the worst of the worst of Nazi Germany's war criminals (via the Washington Post: "'It’s true that the Argentine government, under the command of Nazi sympathizer Juan Domingo Perón, did bring in hundreds, if not thousands, of Nazis. 'In those days, Argentina was a kind of paradise to us,' Nazi Erich Priebke remembered in 1991. And it’s true that some major Nazi operators escaped there, including Adolf Eichmann, a Holocaust mastermind arrested in 1960 in Buenos Aires and later executed in Israel."
Then there is this report from the Chicago Tribune: "Peron's top officials, Argentine documents show, hired Horst Fuldner, an Argentine-born captain of Adolf Hitler's feared SS, to coordinate the entry of at least dozens of Nazi war criminals to Argentina after World War II and help bring in some of the 40,000 other Germans who entered Argentina from 1945 to 1955. Most of the Germans have never been investigated for Nazi ties."
Then there is this from the New York Times:
Two years after President Carlos Saul Menem announced that he would open Argentina's "Nazi files," investigators here say they have found more than a thousand names of suspected Nazi war criminals and collaborators who fled to this country after World War II -- a number that is many times more than previously documented. And the investigators say the hundreds of thousands of pages of documents they have studied in the last eight months show not only the Government's policy of welcoming Nazi war criminals, but also its efforts to impede the search for and prosecution of them by other governments.
Second, there is what historians strongly suspect of Eva Perón herself, which is that she personally coordinated efforts to have Nazi war criminals quietly relocated to Argentina.
As it turns out, there is a lot more to Eva Perón and her authoritarian, Nazi-sympathizing husband than the Madonna movie allows. But I am sure Ocasio-Cortez knew that, expert that she is.Story URLPhoto Caption:Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic U.S. Representative candidate from New York, speaks during an event at the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Friday, Aug. 3, 2018.

Prosecutors should stop the scare tactics. Reforming felony murder rule improves our justice system

Texto completo: In January, California ended a decades-old legal doctrine that put numerous people behind bars for murders they did not commit.
Yet six months after the new state law—Senate Bill 1437—took effect, some prosecutors are trying to overturn it, resorting to scare tactics and false distortions.
We are the legislators who wrote and supported this critical reform, and we need to set the record straight about it.
SB 1437 passed the Legislature last year with bipartisan support and was signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown. It reformed California’s outdated and unfair felony murder rule, which had allowed people who did not kill to nonetheless be charged, convicted, and sentenced as murderers.
The old felony murder doctrine allowed prosecutors to charge all accomplices to a crime with first degree murder. It did not matter if there was no intention to kill, if the death was accidental, or if the accomplice had no knowledge that someone else would kill. Everyone was just as responsible, as if they had planned and committed the murder themselves.
The California Supreme Court, in a 1983 ruling, termed the state’s felony murder rule “barbaric.” And yet it remained on the books, and people were unfairly sentenced to long prison terms under this law.
We studied this issue for over a year before passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 48 in 2017. That measure recognized “the need for statutory changes to more equitably sentence offenders in accordance with their involvement in a crime.”
Then in the following legislative session we introduced SB1437 to correct what we concluded was a grave and needless injustice.
As SB1437 moved through the legislative process, we made significant improvements to ensure it was fair and that our reform did not let people who are responsible for a murder off the hook.
Based on input from district attorneys and other public safety advocates, we amended SB1437 to ensure that a criminal was held accountable for murder if they:
* Are the actual killer.
* Aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, solicited, requested, or assisted the actual killer with the intent to kill.
* Were a major participant in the underlying crime and acted with reckless indifference to life.
And so it’s been disappointing to see some of California’s district attorneys now working to block the law’s implementation. They remain intent on pursuing murder convictions for people not guilty of that crime, despite the fact that it’s not in the interest of public safety nor is it just.
Yet they have challenged SB1437 in court arguing it’s unconstitutional on the grounds that it’s allegedly inconsistent with two ballot initiatives California voters passed decades ago.
Before introducing SB1437, we spent over a year carefully reviewing past statutes, court decisions, and, yes, voter-approved ballot initiatives, to ensure that the provisions in SB1437 did not overstep our role.
SB1437 falls squarely within the Legislature’s broad authority to make policy.
Prosecutors have also challenged SB1437 in the press with mischaracterizations. The president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County, for example, recently told The New York Times that under SB1437, “We’re literally talking about letting murderers go free.”
That’s a false claim designed to stoke fear.
Thankfully, many prosecutors have properly applied the law, and courts around the state have upheld the reform as constitutional. As a result, many deserving people have been able to go home—some after serving decades in prison for murders they did not commit.
It’s not just those newly freed and their families who have recognized the justice served in these cases. In San Luis Obispo County, after a judge found SB1437 constitutional, a reporter went to the parents of the victim.
They said that while they still endure the pain of their son’s death, it did not justify an unfair sentence: “It certainly wouldn’t bring closure to me to see him punished as if he were the murderer,” the parent of one murder victim was quoted as saying
SB1437 is a just and overdue reform. We’re confident that California’s courts will uphold it.

Alertan que ICE tiene acceso a datos de licencias para inmigrantes

Texto completo: Sin el conocimiento los automovilistas, los funcionarios de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) utilizan las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales para aplicar tecnología de reconocimiento facial.
Al menos en Utah , Vermont y Washington –que ofrecen licencias de conducir a inmigrantes indocumentados– los oficiales de ICE han solicitado revisar la información de los automovilistas.
En Utah y Vermont se hicieron las búsquedas requeridas para encontrar a un número no indeterminado de personas, indicó The New York Times.
En el tercer estado, Washington, los agentes autorizaron citaciones administrativas del Departamento de Licencias para realizar un escaneo de reconocimiento facial de todas las fotos, pero se desconoce si logró contretarse la búsqueda.
Los documentos que exponen estos tipos de búsqueda fueron obtenidos a través de solicitudes de registros públicos por el Centro de Privacidad y Tecnología de Georgetown Law y reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post.
Es la primera vez que se confirma que ICE utiliza tecnología de reconocimiento facial para escanear las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatale s, incluidas fotos de residentes legales y ciudadanos.
“Esto es un escándalo”, dijo Harrison Rudolph , un experto en privacidad. “Los estados nunca han aprobado leyes que autoricen a ICE a sumergirse en las bases de datos de licencias de conducir que utilizan el reconocimiento facial para buscar personas” .
Agregó que las entidades no alertan a los indocumentados sobre esa posibilidad.
“Estos estados nunca le han dicho a las personas indocumentadas que cuando solicitan una licencia de conducir también están entregando su rostro a ICE. Eso es un enorme cebo” , consideró.
El Post destaca que la Policía siempre ha tenido acceso a huellas dactilares, ADN y otros “datos biométricos” tomados de sospechosos criminales, pero los registros del DMV contienen las fotos de una gran mayoría de los residentes de cada entidad, la mayoría de los cuales nunca han sido acusados ​​de un delito.
Esto se desarrolla sin autorización de las legislaturas estatales, por lo que un creciente número de legisladores demócratas y republicanos están criticando la tecnología como una herramienta de vigilancia peligrosa, generalizada y propensa a terribles errores.
“El acceso de las agencias de la ley a las bases de datos estatales, especialmente las bases de datos del DMV, a menudo se realiza sin consentimiento” , dijo el presidente del Comité de Supervisión de la Cámara de Representantes, Elh Cummings al Post.
Cuando firmó la reforma que permite otorgar licencias a indocumentados, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, dijo que estos datos no se compartirían con agencias como ICE.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — Utah was one of at least two states that let United States Immigrations and Customs Enforcement use facial recognition technology to mine its database of driver’s licenses, the Washington Post reported.
ICE officials asked to search through driver’s license photos in at least three states that offer licenses to undocumented immigrants, according to documents obtained and released by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology.
Utah and Vermont both complied with the request.
According to The New York Times, this is the first known instance of ICE using facial recognition technology to scan driver’s license databases, but more than two dozen states allow law enforcement officials to request similar searches.
While not many agencies in Utah use facial recognition, the Utah Driver’s License Division uses the tech to catch fraudulent records, division director Chris Caras told KSL.com in May. However, Caras claimed the division does not use its facial recognition technology in conjunction with law enforcement.
“We take privacy very seriously and we don’t want to violate the public trust," Caras told KSL.com in May. "We know that people come to us seeking a service and that we provide a credential that doesn’t just say they have the privilege to operate their motor vehicle but is also the most widely-used identification documentation. So we take that very seriously, but we also know they came to us with that in mind. They weren’t meaning to facilitate a lot of other functionality, and so we try to be respectful of that."
While there are software systems that are able to inject, scan and match photos from “outside” feeds (like a surveillance tape), the division chose to use a system that can only match the pictures in its system with other pictures in its system, Caras said in May.
It’s “kind of nice” when other agencies occasionally ask the division for help identifying someone to simply say the system can’t handle it, Caras explained. If the division ever does decide to upgrade their system to something that can inject outside feed, a discussion about privacy is definitely something that will need to happen, he previously told KSL.com.
However, the documents obtained by Georgetown show that Utah did allow ICE to comb through its database of photos sometime between 2014 to 2017. Caras was appointed division director in August 2015. It is unclear whether Utah still complies with ICE requests, and Caras has yet to respond to requests for comment. This story will be updated with any response.
Harrison Rudolph, a privacy expert and associate at the Georgetown center, told The New York Times that the records “painted a new picture of a practice that should be shut down.”
“This is a scandal,” Rudolph told the news organization. “States have never passed laws authorizing ICE to dive into driver’s license databases using facial recognition to look for folks.”
In June, Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski said she directed city police to “not enforce any federal immigration” policy or ask an individual about their immigration status ahead of possible ICE roundups of undocumented citizens.
ICE spokesman Matt Bourke told The New York Times that the agency would not comment on “investigative techniques, tactics or tools” because of “law-enforcement sensitivities,” but added that, “during the course of an investigation, ICE has the ability to collaborate with external local, federal and international agencies to obtain information that may assist in case completion and subsequent prosecution. This is an established procedure that is consistent with other law enforcement agencies.”
But the continued use of facial recognition technology by government agencies may not last.
San Francisco recently became the first city in the U.S. to ban the use of facial recognition software by police and other city departments. Though generally considered the nation’s most tech-centric area, the city said this ban on technology is part of broader legislation that requires departments to establish use policies and obtain approval before deploying surveillance technology.
The move by San Francisco is also part of a larger conversation and controversy happening around privacy. Last year, civil rights groups called on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to stop selling the company’s facial recognition technology to the government, and others claim this type of surveillance feels a little too close to Big Brother.
A poll conducted on KSL.com of over 700 readers found that 48% supported banning government agencies from using facial recognition technology, 38% did not support a ban and 14% supported a ban, but with some exceptions.
The poll did not control for multiple votes by individuals, however.
This story will be updated if more information becomes available.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and two of his top immigration officials defended the conditions at federal immigrant detention centers on Sunday, amid reports of squalor and overcrowding at several facilities.
Trump, in a tweet posted from his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf resort, called the accounts of unsafe and unsanitary conditions "phony" and "exaggerated" days after an internal government watchdog issued a report describing "dangerous" overcrowding at facilities in Texas.
Speaking to reporters in New Jersey before returning to the White House, Trump said detained migrants "who came from unbelievable poverty" were probably better off in the detention centers.
"If you look, people who came from unbelievable poverty, they had no water, they had no anything where they came from, those are people that are very happy with what's going on, because relatively speaking, they're in much better shape right now," Trump said.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in an interview with ABC's "This Week," said he has been warning lawmakers for months that border security agencies were ill-equipped to handle the growing number of migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.
"My explanation is that it's an extraordinarily challenging situation," McAleenan told "This Week" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. "We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every single day. ... I'm not denying that there are challenging situations at the border. I've been the one talking about it the most."
McAleenan's interview came after an internal Department of Homeland Security report detailed squalid conditions at five facilities in Texas. His comments also followed  a tour by a group of congressional Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-Bronx/Queens), of two Texas facilities where they denounced the treatment of detainees inside, saying they had inadequate access to food, water and medicine.
A DHS Office of Inspector General report released last Tuesday detailed "dangerous" overcrowding at several of the facilities and showed photos of detainees pressed against cell windows in crammed, standing-room only cells that far exceeded their intended capacity. The report also found that children often went days without having access to a shower, remained in soiled clothes and often slept on floors.
"We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained," the report said.
McAleenan said the department has done a "tremendous amount" to alleviate the pressure on detention facilities by having the U.S. Coast Guard medical corps provide additional medical care at border facilities, and by building additional temporary tent housing for children and families.
McAleenan dismissed a joint report published Sunday by The New York Times and El Paso Times that quoted border agents at a Clint, Texas, facility, who said they raised the alarm about the treatment of children at the facility, which has grappled with outbreaks of scabies, chicken pox and shingles.
"What I can tell you right now is that there's adequate food, water, and the reason those children were at Clint station in the first place was so they could have medical care and shower facilities," McAleenan said.
Acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli, appearing on "Fox News Sunday," blamed the influx of migrants fleeing poverty and gang violence in Central America on congressional Democrats, saying they should agree to Trump's calls for stricter entry standards for asylum-seekers.
"You can complain about conditions; conditions are driven by those numbers," Cuccinelli said. "So ultimately they're complaining about the numbers that they're attracting here."
Rep. Rashida Tlalib (D-Mich.), who was part of the congressional delegation that toured the Clint facility last week, told ABC's "This Week" she voted against a $4.6 billion emergency border funding bill that ultimately passed Congress last month because she and other like-minded Democrats, including Ocasio-Cortez, did not want to direct money to a "broken" and "inhumane" system.
"Three agents took me aside, away from my colleagues and said more money is not going to fix this, that they were not trained to separate children," Tlalib said. "That they don't want to separate 2-year-olds away from their mothers. That's not what they were trained for, that's not what they signed up for in their service to our country. They signed up to protect the border, not to separate children, not to put people in cages."
Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," took aim at Trump administration officials who described the reports of unsanitary conditions as unsubstantiated. 
"I'm just like, 'What world are they living in?' " Merkley said."From every direction you see that the children are being treated in a horrific manner. And there's an underlying philosophy that it's OK to treat refugees in this fashion. And that's really the rot at the core of the administratio

Texto completo: Al menos 20 trabajadores inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump a principios de este año están solicitando una reunión en la Casa Blanca.
A través de una carta firmada por 21 de las mucamas, jardineros, personal de cocina y otros exempleados de cinco de los clubes se pide al presidente que “haga lo correcto” y les dé la oportunidad, para explicar las razones por las cuales no deberían ser deportados .
“Somos personas modestas que representan los sueños de los 11 millones de hombres, mujeres y niños indocumentados que viven y trabajan en este país”, dice la carta. “Sabe que somos trabajadores y que no somos delincuentes ni buscamos un viaje gratis a Estados Unidos. Todos pagamos nuestros impuestos, amamos a nuestra fe y a nuestra familia, y simplemente queremos encontrar un lugar para que nosotros podamos mejorar a Estados Unidos”.
Según Associated Press, la misiva ya tuvo respuesta de la Casa Blanca, resumida en que fue recibida la notificación y que se estaba “revisando” la solicitud.
Los exempleados enfatizaron sus años de servicio a la familia Trump, señalando que su labor permitió a los clubes que “sean un éxito y para mantener felices a sus miembros y visitantes”.
La Organización Trump ha despedido a cerca de 20 trabajadores indocumentados de sus clubes de golf en los últimos meses, como resultado de una auditoría realizada, después de que The New York Times informara en diciembre sobre indocumentadas que trabajaban como empleadas domésticas en la propiedad Bedminster, en New Jersey.

Surfliner’s up! David Allen rides Amtrak to San Diego

Texto completo: Usually I go car-free on vacation. This time, I went car-free to vacation.
My wish was to go to San Diego for a long weekend to see my team, the St. Louis Cardinals, play the Padres. And rather than drive to San Diego, I decided to take the train.
The last time I went to San Diego, in 2015, I drove to Encinitas, parked long-term and took the Coaster train to San Diego for the experience, but also to save on hotel parking. Coaster is Metrolink under a different name.
That was a pleasant 50-minute ride. But it made me want to do something more ambitious.
This time I decided to take Amtrak from L.A. Union Station. And to get to Union Station, I took Metrolink.
In other words, I took the train to the train.
This involved a small amount of planning, as I had to find good Amtrak times with a Metrolink train in proximity. Then I booked a modestly priced Gaslamp Quarter hotel — one that wasn’t quite so modest after nearly 20% in taxes — near a trolley stop.
That Friday morning, I drove a few blocks to the Metrolink station in Claremont. But that was the extent of my driving.
As longtime readers know, I’m a fan of public transit and of Metrolink. I enjoy the mild challenge of working out the connections while doing my bit for the environment. Taking transit makes me feel more urban. Plus, riding provides time to read, always a plus.
I got to Union Station more than an hour before my Amtrak train would leave, but that seemed right as I didn’t know about check-in procedures.
With the Pacific Surfliner, it turns out, all you do is board, the same as Metrolink. So I relaxed in a leather chair in the Union Station waiting room until about 20 minutes before departure.
The train was filling up when I did board, and I had lost the chance for a window seat on the second deck. Rookie mistake. Still, the rows are only two seats, so I had a good view regardless.
And the comfort! Compared to airlines, the coach seats are about five inches wider and have about eight inches more legroom.
Which brings up another point: You board without going through a luggage scanner, emptying your pockets, removing your belt and shoes, or submitting to a patdown or nude photo via the body scanner.
You can leave your tray table down the whole trip and use the restroom whenever you like. Now this is a civilized way to travel.
At the first stop, in Fullerton, the passenger at the window seat next to me disembarked. What a break. I scooted over and had a westside window seat the rest of the trip.
After the industrial and business zones came a few patches of agriculture, with pickers working the fields, and the rustic charm of San Juan Capistrano’s Los Rios Street.
South of there, at Capistrano Beach, the surf was perhaps 100 feet away. People could be seen on that shallow stretch of sand walking or sunbathing with books.
After the San Clemente Pier, the train was farther inland, paralleling the 5 Freeway, until the ocean became visible and near again at Solano Beach down a small bluff.
Three hours after leaving Union Station, the Surfliner arrived at the last stop, San Diego’s Santa Fe Depot.
Built in 1915 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the depot has twin domes, lots of arches and a waiting room with wooden benches and a soaring ceiling. It’s not too different from Santa Fe’s 1918 depot in San Bernardino.
From the depot, a $5 daily transit pass got me around, as did hoofing it. I saw the Cardinals-Padres game that first night with a San Diego pal. The Cards lost 3-1.
I’m thankful I skipped the next night, when they lost 12-2. A simple loss can be borne stoically, but a humiliation is too much.
Saturday, my friend picked me up to go bowling. He dropped me off, at my request, at Liberty Public Market, a food hall at Point Loma. I cobbled together lunch from multiple vendors and then wondered how I might find my way back to San Diego proper.
But Google Maps did the trick: A short walk took me to a bus stop, and I made that and two further connections seamlessly, arriving in the Hillcrest neighborhood in 40 minutes.
From there it was one block to my destination, Bluestocking Books, a very good used bookstore. I picked up a collection of Red Smith sports columns, unable to resist the blurb on the back from the New York Times: “Red Smith was to sports what Homer was to war.”
Two blocks away was Record City, an equally good record store, from which I bought a Firesign Theatre boxed set.
Three blocks back and I was soon on a bus that dropped me near my hotel.
Incidentally, I had considered my $71 Amtrak round-trip something of a splurge, especially when Metrolink tickets brought the total to $89. But in San Diego, hotels like mine were charging $45 a night for parking. I was there two nights.
Did I come out a buck ahead?
The next morning, I returned to the Santa Fe Depot and took a seat on one of the worn benches. As I did when I boarded in Los Angeles, I kind of wished I’d dressed in a suit, tie and fedora, and maybe had my shoes polished at a shoeshine stand, all for the vintage effect.
An Amish family was among the waiting passengers. The two men wore beards, hats and slacks, the older man in a vest, and the women were in dresses and bonnets. Now that’s a vintage effect.
Learning from my rookie mistake, I stood in line on the shaded platform to get a window seat. That worked out pretty well.
Except a college-age kid soon took the seat in front of me, and reclined it as far as it would go. By this point, all the other window seats were taken.
Even with his lean, I had plenty of room. I read from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” while enjoying free wi-fi, free electricity for my phone and the same scenes as before, only in reverse.
At Union Station, with an hour and 15 minutes before my Metrolink train home, I rolled my baggage down Alameda Street for lunch at Philippe, founded in 1908. It was an old-time way to end an old-time trip.

Texto completo: It's hard to credit people who say they care about climate change when they don't bother to know anything about the subject. Or when they applaud proposals that would be extraordinarily expensive yet have no effect on the alleged problem and can only teach the public to become cynical about those who come bearing climate-related proposals.
But that's the world we live in. Certainly politicians do not volunteer to deliver more truth than we are willing to hear.
Where fraudulence is the norm, Joe Biden's climate plan needs to be acknowledged for its slightly less fraudulent mien. It doesn't ignore the rest of the world, as the Green New Deal does. Limply, without a hint of conviction, Mr. Biden proposes tariffs to force our agenda on countries whose emissions will actually determine the fate of climate change regardless of anything the U.S. does. It may not be plausible. It may be an undiluted realization of fears that President Trump's penchant for tariffs is becoming the magic solvent for every problem. But at least it's a placeholder in Mr. Biden's plan for a recognition that efforts by the U.S., which accounts for less than 15% of global emissions, are an extravagant empty gesture if other countries don't go along.
Mr. Biden also opens the door to nuclear power, without which honest persons in the climate debate (few and far between) know curbing CO2 is implausible.
Other candidates, let's face it, have adopted the Green New Deal as a contentless virtue signal. Some opine that climate change is about to sink from sight in national politics thanks to various carbon-tax defeats around the world. It won't. It will only grow in potency as a lever for self-interested groups to advance every kind of irrelevant proposal, though these will have zero meaningful impact on climate itself
In the latest development, a New York Times headline accuses the Trump administration of wanting to "put science on trial." Why? Because it is trying to rein in agency shamanizing that uses centurylong, worst-case projections to mislead the public.
Not all administration efforts spring from the mind of Donald Trump. It's hard to see this one as anything but a logical response to the media's own disastrous bungling of last year's U.S. National Climate Assessment. Virtually every story punted on a key metric. None bothered to relate the estimated climate damage risk -- $500 billion a year by 2090 -- to the expected size of the U.S. economy, which would have tended to dampen the panic talk.
Not a single news report mentioned that this outcome was associated with an extreme worst-case temperature increase of more than 11 degrees Fahrenheit. Not one mentioned that the assessment relied on an emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, so extreme that it implies much bigger problems
for future humanity than just a warmer climate.
Instead, just about every U.S. news story satisfied itself with shrill adjectives suggesting the report promised a climate doom that it didn't.
It might interest you to know that, of the two-dozen-plus climate models consulted by scientific bodies, only one model, that of the Institute of Numerical Mathematics in Moscow, accurately simulates past climate changes. It also forecasts the least warming, about 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit, under realistic emissions assumptions.
If the Trump administration is guilty of anything in this instance, it's guilty of paying attention. All too routine has become the habit in official reports of piling up worst-case assumptions and extending them for a century, in hope of producing a headline number the media will misreport as it did in last November's fiasco over the National Climate Assessment.
I mean every word of the following: Ignore climate-science reporting in major U.S. news organs. The press has given up wrestling with the limits of knowledge or accurately relaying the caveats tied to highly abstract computer models. If a worst-case scenario materializes, humanity will have recourse to relatively cheap geoengineering solutions to attempt to mitigate warming. In the meantime, there is no reason to believe the world will forcibly wean itself off fossil fuels. At the same time, the relentless hunt for efficiency and progress of technology will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our industrial civilization. It's even possible to think of cost-effective, pro-growth policies that would accelerate this progress. Unfortunately these lack the faux-heroic scale and price tags that excite the virtuous left nowadays.
The media, for whatever reason, has chosen a role for itself as a cheerleader for climate boondoggles. And the more specialized the media -- the website Inside Climate News is your example here -- the more completely it will devote itself to misleading the public about the true nature of the climate challenge in our democracy.

Texto completo: In diplomacy, small steps can lead to big change.
President Donald Trump's few steps onto North Korean territory last week should be appreciated for what they represent (America's improving relationship with one of the world's most insular states) and what they portend (further reductions in tension on the Korean Peninsula).
Critics have complained that Mr. Trump's various meetings with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un have been little more than showboating. They've produced no progress in dismantling Mr. Kim's nuclear program yet given Mr. Kim a legitimacy his brutally repressive regime does not deserve.
But dialing back the engagement, or going on the offensive, is hardly a viable alternative. Saber-rattling hasn't improved America's relations with Iran. The tariff chess game hasn't helped U.S. ties to China. Decades of trying to isolate Cuba produced ... nothing.
Relationships, such as the one Ronald Reagan had with Mikhail Gorbachev and the one that Jimmy Carter had with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, are the key to change. Mr. Trump has gotten closer to North Korean officials than any other president in history - remarkable considering Mr. Trump's and Mr. Kim's mutual penchant for bellicosity -and he's the first president to step foot on North Korean soil.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim both noted the significance of the moment, which occurred during a meeting at the Demilitarized Zone officially separating North Korea and South Korea. The dictator invited the leader of the free world to step across the border, and the latter obliged. It's the kind of development that pays dividends down the road - maybe not with Mr. Kim renouncing his nuclear ambitions but with wins of other kinds.
Clearly, Mr. Kim, whose family has been shunned by so many for so long, appreciates the attention paid him by Mr. Trump. The British, Germans and French certainly aren't courting him, and China, North Korea's one true ally, treats Mr. Kim like a wayward brother. He'll want to keep the goodwill with Mr. Trump alive.
Critics have suggested that Mr. Trump's friendliness toward Mr. Kim is disrespectful to the family of Otto Warmbier, the Ohio college student arrested during a visit to North Korea in 2016 and returned to the U.S. just days before his death from unexplained head injuries he sustained in captivity.
At the time of Warmbier's detention and death, Mr. Trump had no relationship with Mr. Kim. Now, the president can leverage the pair's rapport in future crises. There already are signs that the relationship is bearing fruit. As The New York Times noted, Mr. Kim has freed some American prisoners, returned the remains of some servicemen missing since the Korean War, put a halt to nuclear tests, paid more attention to his economy and permitted a black market to operate among his impoverished people.
Overnight change in North Korea is extremely unlikely. But engagement has the potential to alter North Korea incrementally, and that is better than nothing.

Texto completo: Poet, writer and musician Joy Harjo has been chosen by Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden to be the United States' first-ever Native American poet laureate.
Harjo will take the reins in the fall, succeeding Tracy K. Smith, who held the position for two years.
"I'm still in a little bit of shock," Harjo told The New York Times, "this kind of award honors the place of Naive people in this country, the place of Native people's poetry."
Harjo, 68, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, has written eight books of poetry, a memoir and two books for young audiences.
She often draws in Native American stories, languages and myths in her work, saying that it "became a way to speak about especially Native women's experience at a time of great social change."
Harjo, who often speaks of diversity of humanity and connecting the global with the personal, said she hopes her time as poet laureate serves as a reminder that "poetry belongs to everyone."

Look to Colorado for a glimpse into Illinois' future

Texto completo: In less than six months, one of Gov. J.B. Pritzker's fondest dreams will come true -- the sale and recreational use of marijuana will be legal in Illinois.
What then?
Nobody knows, although there is considerable speculation. Among the predictions are that it will provide a revenue bonanza for the state, visits to emergency rooms will increase as a consequence of marijuana-related maladies and the use of this previously illegal product will dramatically increase.
Those prognostications barely scratch the surface of what could be in store for the people of Illinois.
There is, however, a barometer to predict the future in the Land of Lincoln. All one has to do is look at the past five years in Colorado, which legalized marijuana in 2014.
The New York Times reported this week that the presence and influence of marijuana has reached into every corner of Colorado, including its capital, where newly empowered lobbyists lay out their legislative wish list for marijuana-supporting Gov. Jarid Polis.
Recent legislative reforms include home delivery of the evil weed and special "marijuana hospitality establishments" where patrons can get stoned without worrying about violating indoor smoking laws.
Legalization, unsurprisingly, has led to increased consumption of marijuana for those 21 and over. Roughly twice as many Coloradans consume marijuana in its various forms as in the rest of the country.
At the same time, surveys involving those underage show mixed results.
Use is roughly the same now as it was before legalization -- an estimated 20 percent of Colorado teens are regular users, meaning the vast majority are not.
At the same time, marijuana-related infractions are the main reason for disciplinary issues in schools and student arrests by police.
Broader statistics for arrests of underage youth fall along the same demographic lines as before legalization -- black youths are still arrested at higher rates than whites and Hispanics.
The evidence shows that while the vast majority of consumers go without incident, for some, marijuana legalization has led to serious medical and mental health issues as well as violent crime.
Records show more people are visiting hospital emergency rooms for treatment of marijuana-related ailments.
"Some are heavy marijuana users with severe vomiting. Others are children who have eaten edibles. ... They come to the ER disoriented, dehyhdrated or hallucinating after consuming too much marijuana," The Times reports.
The mentally ill are particularly vulnerable to marijuana-related problems -- "patients in the ER with marijuana-related cases were five times as likely to have a mental health issue."
Then there are what The Times called "haunting deaths" attributed to marijuana use gone wrong:
-- A "father of three who shot his wife dead after eating edibles."
-- A skier who committed suicide after consuming.
-- Rising numbers of drivers in fatal crashes attributed to marijuana intoxication.
The downside of legalization was no mystery when Colorado as well as other states approved it.
Colorado legislators, just like their counterparts in Illinois, simply decided that the casualties -- whatever their age and for whatever reasons -- are acceptable collateral damage when contrasted to the perceived benefits of legalization, chiefly increased tax revenues.
Along with the intended consequences of legalization have come unintended consequences that may easily apply to Illinois as well as Michigan, the two Midwestern states that have legalized marijuana.
Marijuana dispensaries routinely locate along Colorado's border to serve customers from other states.
At the same time, illegal growers representing major criminal organizations have moved into Colorado to produce marijuana that is exported to other states.
In May, authorities raised 240 homes in the Denver and Northern Colorado area where illegal (non-state-sanctioned) marijuana was being grown.
The U.S. Attorney in Denver calls Colorado "the epicenter of black-market marijuana in the United States."
The Times reports that others have a different view. They see Colorado's marijuana industry as "the next Silicon Valley."

Divulga video violando a adolescente; pero lo exculpan porque es de “buena familia”

Texto completo: Un adolescente de 16 años se filmó mientras agredía sexualmente desde atrás a una joven de su misma edad en el transcurso de una fiesta en Nueva Jersey, Estados Unidos. El abuso con penetración se concretó, además, cuando la víctima se encontraba intoxicada, casi inconsciente en un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la celebración, según las fuentes judiciales.
Luego del aberrante hecho, como si el abuso no fuera suficiente, y según señalaron los investigadores del caso, el joven envió a sus amigos el video junto con la leyenda: “Cuando la primera vez que tuviste relaciones sexuales fue una violación”.
Sin embargo, un juez de la Corte de familia del condado de Monmouth, de Nueva Jersey , llamado James Troiano, solicitó indulgencia para el joven porque “provenía de una buena familia” y que, por las características de su formación, “claramente es un candidato no solo para la universidad, sino para una buena universidad. Sus puntuaciones para ingresar a la universidad fueron muy altas”, aseguró.
La causa y los dichos de Troiano fueron difundidos por el New York Times. El medio estadounidense consigna también que el juez en cuestión, en una audiencia de septiembre de 2017, negó que el acto cometido por el adolescente haya sido una violación, ya que para él solo se considera “violación tradicional” cuando dos o más hombres atacan sexualmente a una mujer a punta de pistola.
Agregó que los fiscales de la causa debieron haber advertido a la víctima de que presentar cargos contra su abusador podría destruir la vida del adolescente. Troiano también cuestionó si el nivel de intoxicación de Mary era tan excesivo como para que no entendiera lo que estaba ocurriendo y no le dio demasiada importancia a los mensajes de texto del acusado porque “los jóvenes dicen muchas estupideces a sus amigos”.
Troinano utilizó todos estos argumentos para negar la moción presentada por los fiscales para que se juzgue al adolescente, como un adulto en un juzgado superior, ya que la ley de Nueva Jersey permite que los menores, a partir de los 15 años, sean juzgados como adultos cuando son acusados de delitos graves.
Pero los argumentos de este juez de 70 años no alcanzaron para evitar que G.M.C. -como fue identificado el imputado- sea tratado como adulto. Troiano fue reprendido severamente por una corte de apelaciones que despejó el camino para que el caso pase de la corte familiar a un tribunal penal de adultos, donde se espera que finalmente se haga justicia.
El caso
El hecho, que llegó esta semana al conocimiento de la opinión púlbica de los Estados Unidos gracias a la decisión de la corte de apelaciones, se remonta a 2017. Siempre según el testimonio de los fiscales del caso, el abuso ocurrió en el contexto de una fiesta en la que había unos 30 adolescentes.
La víctima, identificada como Mary para proteger su identidad, fue llevada, en medio de tropiezos, a un sótano de la casa donde se realizaba la fiesta por un grupo de adolescentes. Allí la sentaron en un sofá, le rociaron la cola con un desodorante de ambientes y la golpearon con tanta fuerza que al otro día tenía marcas en sus nalgas, según rezan los documentos judiciales reproducidos por el New York Times.
Entonces fue cuando se produjo el episodio que grabó G.M.C. donde se lo veía a él penetrando a la menor. Luego de esto, el adolescente salió del sótano y Mary fue encontrada en el piso con vómitos. La llevó hasta su casa la madre de un amigo.
A la mañana siguiente, Mary estaba confundida por su ropa desgarrada y los moretones que tenía en su cuerpo, y le dijo a su mamá que tenía miedo de que “hubieran ocurrido episodios sexuales en la fiesta” sin su consentimiento.

Texto completo: It was a case that captivated the nation, first with its disquieting details, then with the legal implications of its outcome.
Seventeen-year-old Michelle Carter bombarded her suicidal boyfriend with dozens of texts encouraging him to carry out a plan to take his own life — until he did, flooding his truck with carbon monoxide fumes in a Fairhaven, Mass., parking lot.
Throughout the highly publicized trial that followed, prosecutors successfully cast Carter as a cold-blooded manipulator, who goaded Conrad Roy III into suicide so she could bask in peers' sympathies at school.
But did Carter's part in Roy's death constitute criminal action — as first ruled in 2017 with her involuntary manslaughter conviction, and upheld five months ago in Massachusetts' highest court — or immoral behavior by a troubled young woman?
“Michelle Carter is seen as almost this indefensible character," says director Erin Lee Carr, speaking by phone. “I'm doing the exact inverse of that; I'm creating a defense but also allowing you to see the prosecution."
In her two-part HBO documentary “I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth V. Michelle Carter," airing Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Carr sketches a complex picture of Carter and her toxic, mostly text-based relationship with Roy, imploring audiences to make up their own minds on whether she belongs behind bars. The film's first half focuses on the prosecution's case against Carter, while its second shades in her personal struggles more sympathetically.
In opting for a bench trial, Carter left her fate in the hands of a judge; viewers of Carr's film, the director hopes, can serve as the jury she never had. And with Carter's lawyers expected to appeal her case to the US Supreme Court this month, the film arrives at a critical juncture.
“I love that documentary filmmaking is an additional venue to discuss fraught criminal cases," says Carr, 31. “Sometimes, the court system has an inability to see nuance. This is a possible route to recontextualize and reimagine cases."
All Carr's films dig deep into dark, complicated subjects. Her first, “Thought Crimes," covered the infamous case of the cannibal cop, who fantasized about raping and eating women, while “Mommy Dead and Dearest" probed Gypsy Rose Blanchard's murder of her abusive mother Dee Dee. Her latest HBO doc, “At the Heart of Gold," shone a light on the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, letting victims of now-imprisoned ex-sports doctor Larry Nassar share their stories.
Producer Andrew Rossi, Carr's frequent collaborator, says “I Love You, Now Die" looks intently at whether one person can truly be responsible for another's suicide.
“It was always a question of what kind of legal precedent is being set," he explains by phone. “How comfortable are we as a society with this determination, ultimately, that she was guilty?"
Asked whether she feels justice was served in the case, Carr avoids taking a personal stance. “It's even-handed," she says of the documentary. “For me to answer that shows you my hand." That said, the filmmaker has issues with how media outlets covered Carter and prosecutors framed their case.
“I do feel safe in saying that I believe Michelle Carter was demonized," says Carr. “Here's this pretty girl with eyebrows, who knew what she was doing and killed him to become popular is a good story," she adds. “But is it the actual story? No."
Before investigating, like many others, Carr had been morbidly transfixed by those text messages. “It's now or never." “You just need to do it, Conrad." “No more waiting." And most chillingly, after Roy is alleged to have gotten out of the car in which he was dying: “Get back in."
“It was unlike anything I'd ever seen," says Carr, recalling her “vitriolic" reaction to first reading Carter's texts. “I've seen bullying, and people have said mean things to me, but to see this — a strategic, intense pushing of someone toward an act that will irrevocably change their life and their families' lives — a lot of people would look at that and say, 'She's sick.' "
But Carr suspected there was more to the story and felt compelled to take a closer look. The daughter of David Carr, the late New York Times columnist, she grew up around storytelling, grasping early on the importance of treating interview subjects with compassion. Carr learned harder lessons from her father, too. A complicating force in their relationship was his addiction to alcohol and crack cocaine. In the journalist's 2008 memoir “The Night of the Gun," he interviewed people from his past to confront shaky memories of his life on the street, including the time he put Erin and her twin sister into foster care.
“My dad, through his own admission, did terrible things and grew into somebody respectful, empathic and with humility," explains Carr. “As I approach people seen as indefensible, there's a part of me that really wants to prove otherwise."
Researching the case, Carr soon came to understand it as a tragedy of not one but two young people in free fall, both with severe mental issues, both rapidly uncoupling from reality.
Carter and her family members declined all requests to be interviewed (Roy's family is heavily featured). But Carr and Rossi nonetheless felt they could effectively include Carter's voice by drawing upon tens of thousands of her texts.
“It's a trove as a filmmaker," says Carr.
Staring such darkness and despair in the face has taken a personal toll, Carr admits. “It's hard to think about suicide for four years," she says. “It's not great to melt your brain in."
Carr has projects in the works at HBO and Netflix, though she'll take a breather once her next one wraps in August. “I listen to my therapist," says Carr. She plans to get a dog.
Still, she remains drawn to true crime, in all its stomach-churning detail. “I'm in this little pocket of telling stories about people who did terrible things, but [for whom] maybe there's something else there," she says. “It's something I feel I was put on this Earth to do."

NEW COKE FINDS SUCCESS WITH STRANGER THINGS'

Texto completo: New Coke is a smashing success? Has our world turned upside down?
Sort of.
The sweeter version that 34 years ago was positioned to send the original Coca-Cola recipe to retirement is on a temporary comeback trail thanks to the third season of "Stranger Things," which is set to debut Thursday.
Season 3 of the Netflix series is set in 1985, the same year that New Coke debuted to much fanfare, crashed due to consumer reluctance and pushed to the back of the grocery shelf by the original recipe. This all happened within a span of a little over two months.
New Coke reportedly will be featured along with Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Will (Noah Schnapp) and the rest of the gang as they traverse another creepy adventure tied to the Upside Down. "It was one of the first ideas in our Season 3 brainstorm," the Duffer Brothers, the show's creators, told The New York Times in an email interview.
"It was the summer of '85, and when you talk about pop culture moments, New Coke was a really big deal. It would have been more bizarre to not include it."
Coca-Cola has also made available a limited edition of 500,000 "Stranger Things"-themed cans. But you'll have no luck finding it at your local grocerystore. The new New Coke can be purchased in a manner that wasn't available back in 1985 through the company's website. Free samples also will be available at special events around the country, according to the website.
Coca-Cola had to dig through its archives to find the New Coke recipe, according to the Times. The company, as well as Netflix, told the publication that no payment was made for the product placement in the show. Netflix, however, said it had reached agreements with 75 brands to promote one of its most popular series.
New Coke was never officially given that name. Instead it was simply called Coke as its new concoction replaced the old, which by 1985 had been losing market shares to diet colas and other soft drinks.
The negative reaction to the original run of New Coke included boycotts, letter-writing campaigns and thousands of calls to Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta.
The company responded by going back to the original recipe, which was rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic. New Coke remained Coke until it was renamed Coke II in 1992, and then discontinued in 2002.
A number of reviewers who ordered the limited edition cans from the Coke website asked the company to bring back New Coke permanently.

Give Nets' Dinwiddie an assist for team's free agent jackpot

Texto completo: On social media, Spencer Dinwiddie was tormenting the Knicks and their fans. Behind the scenes, he was sabotaging their plans by successfully recruiting Kyrie Irving to Brooklyn.
Dinwiddie was instrumental in convincing Kyrie Irving, in particular, that the Nets were an attractive destination after the two guards forged a relationship as classmates last offseason in a Harvard business course, according to the New York Times.
Once Irving was on board, Kevin Durant was more eager to commit his signature, leading to the stunning events at the start of free agency. Both Irving and Durant took discounts so that the Nets could sign DeAndre Jordan, who according to the Times, also believed Brooklyn would be a better place for the star duo than Madison Square Garden.
Jordan spent three months with the Knicks last season after being traded from Dallas. According to a source, the Knicks believed he could help recruit his good buddy Durant and kept him past the deadline. But maybe the attempt backfired.
"Jordan also was convinced in recent days that Barclays Center would be a more hospitable backdrop for Durant and Irving than Madison Square Garden and joined the chorus promoting the Nets," the Times reported.
Publicly, Dinwiddie, the outspoken 26-year-old from L.A., was also at the forefront of the Brooklyn's push. During the season, he teased the idea of Durant carrying the Nets to the NBA Finals in an interview with the News.
"Why would I actively recruit arguably the best player in the world - Kevin Durant - to come to our team when he would fill the exact spot that we need and potentially take us from just being an eighth-, seventh-seed or so, to an Eastern Conference championship team? Oh please write this down," Dinwiddie said.
Leading up to free agency, Dinwiddie - who is Brooklyn's Sixth Man and offensive sparkplug - had sparred with Knicks fans by tweeting multiple barbs directed at the team.
The day Irving and Durant committed to the Nets over the Knicks, Dinwiddie didn't forget about his favorite targets.
"Oh, and @nyknicks fans I didn't forget about y'all either."
Underneath that message were three laughing emojis and an image portraying fire and brimstone. From a Harvard course to hellfire for the Knicks.

Texto completo: Believe the hype. "Fleishman Is in Trouble" is even better than we were promised. Taffy Brodesser-Akner, a New York Times Magazine writer, brings to her first novel the currency of a hot dating app and the wisdom of a Greek tragedy. The result is a feminist jeremiad nested inside a brilliant comic novel - a book that makes you laugh so hard you don't notice till later that your eyebrows have been singed off.
As the story opens, life sounds like an erotic carnival for Toby Fleishman. A New York doctor newly separated from his wife, Toby has arrived at the age of 41 to discover a city suddenly flush with women who want him. Now. "His phone was aglow from sunup to sundown," the narrator writes, with texts that contained "underboob and sideboob and just straight up boob and all the parts of a woman he never dared dream he would encounter."
Brodesser-Akner demonstrates an anthropologist's thoroughness in her study of contemporary adult dating and its catalog of sexual practices, but her prose, ringing with manic energy, is obscenely funny.
Poor Toby is thrust into a state of constant arousal, punctuated by moments of deep confusion about his impending divorce from a successful talent agent. What should he reveal to his colleagues about the dissolution of his marriage? And most baffling, what should he tell his son and daughter, who find themselves suspended between two homes?
Perhaps every engaged couple should read this book before they tie the knot. With merciless precision, Brodesser-Akner traces the arcing trajectory of doomed affections: the glorious takeoff, the deluded calm, the shrieking descent.
Much of the first section of the novel follows Toby's frantic efforts to sleep with as many women as he can, while locking down a big promotion at the hospital and taking care of his children. You see, Fleishman is in trouble. His estranged wife, Rachel, has stopped returning his calls. She's no longer picking up the kids. Toby doesn't even know where she is. It's just her latest infuriatingly selfish stunt - or at least Toby would have us believe as he recalls one example after another of her lack of affection, her disregard for how much he does to keep their family humming.
So far, so John Updike. But there's something wonderfully contrary going on here.
This entire story is told by Toby's old friend, Libby Epstein. So expansive and intimate is her knowledge of Toby's experience that it's easy to imagine we're hearing the voice of an omniscient narrator. It turns out that, like Brodesser-Akner herself, Libby used to be a writer for a men's magazine, and she's most comfortable expressing herself in expansive profiles of other people. The further we read into this tale of Toby's marital discord, the more we realize that Libby is trying to work out something about her own existential plight.
That becomes more explicit in the novel's final section. Libby's sympathies - and ours - are suddenly unmoored in the conflicting currents of love and resentment. Perhaps Toby is not the long-suffering saint he imagines himself to be. When Libby finally comes out from the margins of this story, she uses Rachel to offer a sustained reflection on the impossible pressures that talented women endure.
I haven't felt this much energy sparking off a novel since Claire Messud's "The Woman Upstairs." Here, in one gut-punching paragraph after another, is the articulate fury of someone who once dared to imagine that her ambition could be expressed and appreciated. Only too late does Rachel realize that "her success made her poison." She's ripped apart by the demands of full-time motherhood and the new requirements of full-time work.
But Brodesser-Akner swings the sword full circle, slicing through the demeaning rules of the patriarchy just as effectively as she slays the fatuous optimism of that "girl-power" propaganda fed to modern girls.
Conveying the full tragedy of that predicament in a story that's often blisteringly funny is the real triumph of this book. Few novels express so clearly that we're all in trouble.

Texto completo: The plan was to celebrate the Fourth of July with a televised extravaganza on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. One unstated goal was to show support for the president at a time of bitter division in the nation.
The president was Richard M. Nixon, and the year was 1970. Nixon was facing rising opposition to the Vietnam War after expanding the conflict into Cambodia. Wealthy friends of the president began organizing an Honor America Day co-hosted by evangelist Billy Graham and comedian Bob Hope. Capping the day would be a star-studded show at the Lincoln Memorial. The goal: to draw a record 500,000 people to the Mall to celebrate America's birthday.
The 1970 event is the only parallel to President Trump's takeover of July 4. Trump's elaborate "Salute to America" will feature a speech by the president himself at the Lincoln Memorial, reserved seating for hundreds of VIPs, two fireworks displays and flyovers by the Blue Angels and Air Force One. Trump has also requested military tanks - Abrams tanks or Bradley Fighting Vehicles - on the Mall for the event.
By contrast, Nixon did not appear at the 1970 celebration; he was at his summer White House in San Clemente, Calif. But he did record a video that was played at the event.
The 1970 celebration was the brainchild of Reader's Digest publisher Hobart Lewis. He recruited J. Willard Marriott, head of the Marriott hotel chain, to raise funds. Marriott insisted the event would "be absolutely free of politics. It's not to promote anybody's pet ideas."
To underscore the nonpartisan theme, Republicans and Democrats were honorary members of the organizing committee. Many Democratic politicians also supported the event.
But some were skeptical of the claim of nonpartisanship. New Left activist Rennie Davis, one of the "Chicago Eight" charged with inciting a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, called the planned event "a Republican Convention" sponsored by "white, middle-class Republican men."
Davis organized the "Emergency Committee To Prevent a July 4th Fistfight" to protest the event.
On the left, the Black United Front called for a black boycott of the event. On the right, the Rev. Carl McIntire, an advocate of total victory in the Vietnam War, said, "Patriots will have nothing to do with a convocation of compromise that desecrates our heritage with the ballyhoo of Hollywood."
Meanwhile, advocates of legalizing marijuana already had planned a national smoke-in at the Washington Monument on July 4. This prompted Honor America co-host Hope to quip, "Before this is over, I may need some of that stuff myself."
Seeking to add appeal for liberals, Hope invited African American comedian Dick Gregory to join the July 4 show. Gregory politely declined, writing Hope in a letter. "If the celebration was strictly entertainment, completely free of social and political implications, I would be the first to join you. A celebration in our nation's capital on the Fourth of July cannot possibly be a politically neutral event."
Planning went on despite the threat of protests. "Tens of thousands of Americans prepared this July 4 to observe Honor America Day, conceived by its sponsors as a huge outpouring of patriotic unity in a divided nation," wrote young Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein four years before his Watergate reporting helped force Nixon to resign.
The hot, muggy July 4 began with a Billy Graham prayer service at the Lincoln Memorial. Despite the promise of unity, Graham declared that "the overwhelming majority" of Americans are fed up with "a relatively small extremist element [who] had knocked our courts, desecrated our flag, disrupted our educational system, laughed at our religious heritage and threatened to burn down our cities." He added: "Today we call upon all Americans to stop this polarization before it is too late."
Meanwhile, young people described by some reporters as "hippies and yippies" shouted obscenities and raised the Viet Cong flag. As the U.S. Army Band played "The Star-Spangled Banner," some protesters marched in the nearby reflecting pool to a set of bongo drums. Later, some went skinny-dipping in the pool. Countering the antiwar protesters were members of the National Socialist White People's Party, some wearing Nazi insignia.
The main event was the televised evening show at the Lincoln Memorial. Police set up barricades between protesters and the audience seated to watch the show. Just as the show was about to get underway, protesters overturned a Good Humor ice cream truck, and anti-riot police moved in. The police or someone in the crowd threw a tear-gas canister, and the tear gas "wafted" over the back rows of the audience. Some protesters threw bottles.
As he prepared to go onstage, master of ceremonies Hope looked out at the scene and remarked, "It looks like Vietnam, doesn't it?"
The televised show went off without a hitch. Kate Smith sang a stirring rendition of "God Bless America." Comedian Red Skelton recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Then came performances by comedian Jack Benny, Dinah Shore and Glenn Campbell.
Nixon's remarks were short and nonpartisan. "Let us all look back on this day," he said, "so we will be reminded of what great sacrifices have been made to make this day possible."
The only jarring note of non-unity came when Jeannie C. Riley sang, "When You're Running Down My Country, You're Walking On The Fighting Side of Me."
The show ended with the traditional display of fireworks. The day drew an estimated 250,000 to 350,000 people, a sizable number but short of the goal. Police arrested 34 people, mostly for disturbing the peace. News reports suggest most protesters were peaceful, and most spectators were there simply to celebrate Independence Day.
Honor America organizer Marriott declared the event a huge success. Marriott deplored "the irreverent interferences and obstructionism of a small group of disaffected, pathetic youths." He said 98 percent of the crowd was "orderly" and "properly reverent."
But New York Times columnist Tom Wicker wrote that the event's goal of unity was doomed to failure from the beginning: "Honor America Day could not attract men and women who believe little honor is due a nation, whatever its history and power, that persists in a brutal and destructive war long after its purpose can be discerned."
Humor columnist Art Buchwald speculated that Democrats worried Republicans next would try to steal Christmas. "It's in the works already," Buchwald joked. "Bing Crosby and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale have been asked to head the Keep Christmas in America committee, which is supposed to bring Americans together on Christmas morning."

Texto completo: Brenda Maddox may have been best known for her biography of Nora Barnacle, who inspired some of Irish literature's most memorable characters, but she crafted what may have been her most resonant line while writing about a DNA researcher history nearly forgot.
“Rosalind Franklin has become a feminist icon, the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology, the woman whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male," Ms. Maddox wrote in “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA," her 2002 book about the British scientist whose key early research was mostly overlooked amid the accolades heaped on James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick.
Bringing her background as a reporter to the longer form of biographies, Ms. Maddox illuminated the lives of literary greats such as George Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, and W.B. Yeats. And with 1988's “Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom," she brought full recognition to Barnacle, who would marry James Joyce and inspire some of his fictional characters, including Gretta in “The Dead" and Molly Bloom in “Ulysses."
Ms. Maddox, who spent her childhood and youth in Bridgewater and Brockton, and who began her writing career in Greater Boston, was 87 when she died June 16 in her London home. Her family told news organizations the cause was complications of dementia.
“I honestly consider myself a journalist," she told the Globe in 1988 during interviews for the publication of “Nora." “I am not a feminist crusader. This book brings out the qualities of a woman who has been hidden."
Reviewing “Nora: The Real Life of Molly Bloom" that year, Globe critic Robert Taylor wrote that Ms. Maddox's “illuminating book scotches, once and for all, the notion of Nora Barnacle as a primitive lass from the west of Ireland whom the author of 'Ulysses' and 'Finnegans Wake' married because she let him get on with his writing."
In the Globe interview, Ms. Maddox recalled that she had begun the biography a few years earlier “liking Nora. I finished in awe of her." Nora, she added, lived through tumultuous decades whose events included “the emancipation of women" and two world wars.
“With her strength, wit and calm, she survived them all, just as she survived 37 years with James Joyce and taught him what life was all about," Ms. Maddox said.
Meanwhile, Ms. Maddox's book about Rosalind Franklin taught scholars, scientists, and science fans alike about someone who had made essential contributions to science.
A year ago, New York Times science columnist Carl Zimmer cited “Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA" as the book he wished more people would read.
“The story of the discovery of the structure of DNA has been told over and over again from James Watson's perspective," Zimmer said in an interview with the Globe. “Rosalind Franklin's story is also important, and Maddox tells it wonderfully well."
Born in 1932, Brenda Murphy was the only child of Dr. Brendan Murphy and Edith Giamperoli. A few weeks after Brenda turned 3, her physician father died. She was raised by her mother, who gave square-dancing lessons, even though she used a wheelchair due to complications from polio.
After graduating from Radcliffe College, Ms. Maddox began her writing career as a reporter for The Patriot Ledger in Quincy. Moving to England, she attended the London School of Economics. “I hated it," she later told the Globe. “I didn't last the year."
Instead, Ms. Maddox recalled, she wrote briefly for the Reuters news service.
While covering a UN conference in Geneva, she met John Maddox, a science writer and editor for the Guardian newspaper and later the editor of Nature magazine. They married in 1960.
Early in their marriage, she wrote for the Economist magazine, where she subsequently was an editor, and occasionally wrote for the Globe about a variety of subjects, including traveling with children. Perhaps inspired by her own experiences, she praised the un-France-like informality at mealtime for tourists in Brittany, where the Bretons allowed children to “wander in and out between courses and wear their pajamas to supper."
She would later write that as a journalist for the Economist, she watched “with fascination the long-running Irish debate on contraception, abortion, divorce, and illegitimacy. Whatever problems women have, Irish women have them worse. I began to see Nora Barnacle as typical of a certain kind of Irish girl — desperate to escape from her circumstances, unequipped with anything but strength of character and charm."
Along with the Nora Barnacle biography, Ms. Maddox wrote books about literary figures that included “D.H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage" (1994), “George's Ghosts: A New Life of W.B. Yeats" (1999); and “George Eliot: Novelist, Lover, Wife" (2009).
In her book “The Half Parent: Living with Other People's Children" (1975), she drew from her experience as a stepmother to John Maddox's children and spoke of their good fortune in marrying.
“My husband and I could not have been better suited, although we had grown up thousands of miles apart," she wrote about Maddox, who died in 2009. “We were good at school, loners, readers, escapers from poor, ambitious families and from claustrophobic small towns that had given us an incurable preference for city life. After time spent in academia, his much longer than mine, we had discovered the guilty delights of journalism. We might have been matched by computer."
According to The Washington Post, Ms. Maddox's survivors include a daughter, Bronwen of London; a son, Bruno of Beacon, N.Y.; two stepchildren, Imma and Piers, both of England; and three granddaughters.
When Ms. Maddox was a college student, a seminar at Harvard University in Anglo-Irish literature, led by the scholar and professor John V. Kelleher, had sparked her interest in Nora Barnacle. Kelleher noted that the Joyces had spoken Italian at home.
“My own grandparents were immigrants to America from Ireland and Italy, and I had heard Italian spoken in my home," Ms. Maddox would later tell the Globe. “I was intrigued by this Irish family who had gone east, not west."
Years later, her interest was rekindled when, as a present, her husband gave her Richard Ellmann's acclaimed biography of James Joyce.
“In reading the biography," she recalled, “I wondered: What about Nora? Joyce was a genius. How did Nora take herself from being a chambermaid in Dublin to becoming a hostess in Paris?"
Ms. Maddox added that several years after James Joyce died, Nora was bringing a journalist to visit his grave and commented during a cab ride: “I often think he must like the cemetery he is in. It is near the zoo and you can hear the lions roar."
That anecdote would prompt Ms. Maddox to write about how essential an inspiration Nora must have provided for her husband, including for a memorable passage in his story “The Dead":
“The woman whose memory of a dead lover in a lonely graveyard led to one of the most beautiful passages in English literature casually conjured up for a total stranger a vision of her husband lying in his grave, enjoying the sound of lions, perhaps chuckling to himself. It suggests that Nora herself may have evoked for Joyce the final scene in 'The Dead,' the snow falling on the grave of Michael Furey."

Texto completo: RGJ business reporter Jason Hidalgo took home a major national award for his body of work covering Northern Nevada's real estate industry.
Hidalgo won a bronze award from the National Association of Real Estate Editors in Austin on Friday, tying with a reporter from The Washington Post. The award was for "best collection of work by an individual covering residential real estate." A reporter from the Houston Chronicle took home first place and reporters from the New York Times and Boston Globe tied for second.
The judges said, "Hidalgo dives into data and neighborhoods to provide well-written and in-depth stories that reveal the motivations and consequences of poorly conceived laws. Detailed, thorough and important watch-dog reporting."
Hidalgo has been recognized by the organization for his reporting on the real estate industry several times.
That includes winning the President's Award in 2010 for mapping the hardest-hit zip codes in the region during the 2010 foreclosure crisis as well as winning top award for an investigation he did into short sales in Northern Nevada in 2014.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — California Sen. Kamala Harris' rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination defended her after criticisms based on her race circulating on social media, which were amplified when Donald Trump Jr. shared one such post with his more 3. 6 million followers on Thursday.
Trump Jr. retweeted a post from Ali Alexander – a conservative commentator whose Twitter profile claims to have "exposed Kamala Harris" – that said "Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican. I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting. "
"Is this true? Wow," President Donald Trump's oldest son wrote, before deleting the post that same night, according to The New York Times.
Tucker Carlson comments on Cory Booker's race: Fox News host calls Booker one of 'whitest candidates' among 2020 Democrats
"Don’s tweet was simply him asking if it was true that Kamala Harris was half-Indian because it’s not something he had ever heard before," Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr. told the Times. "And once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it. "

Harris, 54, was born in Oakland, Calif. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan came to America from India where she met Donald Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica. Both civil rights activists, they met while pursuing graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Harris said in her memoir, "The Truths We Hold: An American Journey. "
Many took note of Trump Jr. 's retweet, including those competing against Harris for the Democratic nomination. Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff thanked "the 2020 candidates and everyone else for calling out this crap for what it is. "
"Donald Trump Jr. is a racist too. Shocker," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , said on Twitter Saturday, along with a link to the Times story about Trump Jr. 's retweet.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro called the attacks on Harris "disgusting" during an interview with CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday and called Trump Jr. a "coward" for his tweet.
"He knows what he's doing," Castro said. "He's giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris. We need to dispel them immediately and condemn them, and then not give them any more life, because they're disgusting. "
"The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, in a tweet. "We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it’s within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks. "
"This is racism. It was wrong before, and it’s wrong now. We won’t allow it again," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N. Y. , said on Twitter.
"There's a long history of black Americans being told they don't belong – and millions are kept down and shut out to this day. @KamalaHarris is an American. Period. And all of us must call out attempts to question her identity for what they are: racist," said former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said the attacks on Harris "represent the worst of us. "
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N. J. , put it more simply, tweeting that Harris "doesn’t have s--- to prove. "
Former Vice President Joe Biden compared the budding social media campaign about Harris' background to the "birtherism" conspiracy theory that questioned former President Barack Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.
Donald Trump, then a reality TV star, was a leading voice of birtherism during the Obama era.
"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America," Biden said in a tweet.
Biden and Harris had a feisty exchange on the issue of race and racism during the first Democratic debate of the 2020 campaign season.
Harris campaign spokeswoman Lily Adams weighed in on Donald Trump Jr. 's retweet.
"This is the same type of racist attacks his father used to attack Barack Obama. It didn’t work then and it won’t work now," Adams said in a statement.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also compared the attacks to birtherism.
"The presidential competitive field is stronger because Kamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It’s long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks," Buttigieg said in a tweet.
Similarly, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called it a "coordinated smear campaign" and said the "Trump family is peddling birtherism again and it’s incumbent on all of us to speak out against it. "
"It is more than 'birtherism again' to question the race of @KamalaHarris. It’s racism," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
Alexander said in a statement that it was Harris' claim to African-American identity during the debate that he was denouncing, and denied that he was trying to make any kind of "birtherism" argument, acknowledging that Harris was born in Oakland, California to parents "who were naturalized citizens. "
“Me pointing out that Kamala Harris has a mother from India and a father from Jamaica went viral last night because many people assume she descends from Black American Slaves,” he said. "She does not. I corrected Kamala Harris last night because she stole debate time under the premise that she is an African-American when she is in fact a biracial Indian-Jamaican who is a first generation American. "
Some on social media said the viral spread of Alexander's post appeared to be aided by artificial accounts, commonly referred to as bots. Such accounts were central to the social media element of Russia's "sweeping and systematic" effort to interfere in the 2016 election, according to the special counsel Robert's Mueller's report.
One post by freelance journalist Caroline Orr was cited by several news publications.
"A lot of suspect accounts are pushing the 'Kamala Harris is not Black' narrative tonight. It’s everywhere and it has all the signs of being a coordinated/artificial operation," Orr posted after the debate.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. , indicated she believed bots played a role in disseminating Alexander's tweets.
"These troll-fueled racist attacks on Senator @KamalaHarris are unacceptable. We are better than this (Russia is not) and stand united against this type of vile behavior," Klobuchar tweeted.
Rep. Seth Mouton, D-Mass. , said "these attacks are being promoted by the same kind of bot activity the Russians and others used to hijack our democracy in 2016. Don't fall for it. "
But a Twitter spokesperson told The Hill, "Reports of malicious automation and 'bots' are false. "
"We've see no coordinated activity around the debates, or this particular content. It is organic users sharing these views, much of which is not in violation of our policies. "
Harris is not the only candidate whose identity as an African-American has been questioned by conservatives. After Wednesday night's debate, Fox News host Tucker Carlson referred to Booker, who is black, as one of "the two whitest candidates on stage" in a screed against Booker and O'Rouke's use of Spanish.

Texto completo: A federal wealth tax is seriously being considered in the current presidential campaign.
The concept has been embraced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Further adding to interest in the wealth tax is support announced last week by California philanthropist Eli Broad, and nineteen other American billionaires upon whom the tax would fall. Broad’s letter was published in the New York Times under the remarkable title, “I’m in the 1%. Please, Raise My Taxes.”
Sen. Warren estimates the tax will raise $2.75 trillion dollars in ten years. Economists have split over whether that is a realistic number, especially given the ability of the ultra-wealthy to devise evasion schemes for virtually any tax government ever proposes. However, at 50% compliance, the tax would still increase the annual revenue available for the federal government by almost 5%.
Whether this concept is wise should be analyzed under economic, constitutional, and liberty considerations.
The economics of this proposal depends on two factors. The first is the uses to which this money is put. Not surprisingly, the Democratic presidential candidates all propose spending the wealth tax on new programs; none proposes to pay back federal borrowing to reduce the debt. The economic benefit of each expenditure provides fair ground for debate. Preschool education for children whose parents cannot otherwise afford it may well generate long-term economic benefits. Giving the money to politically favored constituencies is less likely to do so.
The second factor is the dampening effect on economic activity from such a tax. Here, the wealth tax has an advantage over an income tax. People do less of that which is taxed. So, we can expect wealthy people to consume more and save less, given that every year the amount they have saved will be taxed anew. Sen. Warren estimates that only 75,000 families will be subject to her wealth tax. If they save less and consume more, it might actually stimulate economic growth. By contrast, an increase in income tax would, at the margin, depress the process of creating income—a much more damaging result.
A federal wealth tax might run into Constitutional trouble under Article I, section 9, which forbids the federal government from imposing a “direct” tax, except in proportion to each state’s population. A wealth tax is not proportional to population. In 1895, the Supreme Court held the federal income tax unconstitutional as a direct tax, not proportional to population. Proponents then passed the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913, allowing federal taxes on income. However, in 1921, the court ruled the federal tax on inheritance was not a direct tax. One of these two opinions must be wrong.
My prediction is that the court will define a direct tax as one that is imposed without a person choosing to do anything. A sales tax, for instance, is indirect: it is triggered by the act of buying something; but a wealth tax is direct, it requires no action at all.
The most important concern is from the point of view of liberty. Sen. Warren was asked after the debate how the federal government could assess the value of individuals’ shares in private companies, fine art, or jewels. She lit up almost with delight to say that it would be easy to keep tabs on only 75,000 families. She appeared to relish the concept of government agents who would, year in and year out, make an inventory of all that some Americans possess. She evinced no concern at all for this invasion of privacy, the unfairness of taxing the same income multiple times (once when earned, then every year it was kept), or the evisceration of a notion that once we acquire property, we can depend on keeping it.
There may be little sympathy for the 75,000 wealthiest families in America; but that is how liberty is lost — incrementally.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — A major supplier of body cameras to law-enforcement agencies across the country has decided to forgo selling facial-recognition technology with its products.
Axon, which supplies 48 police departments in major cities with body cameras, made the decision after the company’s ethics board concluded the technology was not accurate enough to be implemented in the field and could potentially cause major trust issues between law-enforcement officials and their communities.
In a 42-page report, the ethics board detailed concerns with the inaccuracy of the software, saying results showed it was less accurate when identifying women, younger people, and “worsens when trying to identify people of color compared to white people, a troubling disparity that would only perpetuate or exacerbate the racial inequities that cut across the criminal justice system. ”
Is Facebook listening to me? Why those ads appear after you talk about things
The board is composed of experts from different professions, including law enforcement, robotics and policy, and advises Axon on the potential effects its technology could have on society.
“Some police departments are sophisticated and would understand the limitations on (facial recognition) and would put their own guardrails in place around the use of that technology by their officers. But there are some police departments that would not take those same precautions and may not appreciate the implications of using a technology that’s not ready yet for prime-time,” said board member Jim Bueermann, who served as a police officer for over 30 years and is now president of the National Police Foundation.
Axon CEO Rick Smith said the company is “moving cautiously” because of these implications.
“There are companies out there actively promoting using facial recognition on body cameras,” Smith said. “From our perspective, we believe taking the time to do the ethical analysis up front in the product design process will have much better outcomes in the long haul. ”
Smith says the company might reconsider incorporating the technology in their products in the future once the inaccuracies are solved, but must balance that with privacy and safety and put in “safeguards” to avoid misuse of facial recognition.
“We don’t believe that the right answer is that the police should deploy face recognition with no controls and go wild with it, but similarly we don’t believe that it makes sense to say police should never use face-recognition technology because there’s many cases where it’s pretty universally known that it will be a good thing,” Smith said.
Facial recognition has been a hot-button topic around the country as concerns about privacy and accuracy have made some cities skeptical of the technology, leading San Francisco to ban it altogether, with cities such as Oakland and Berkeley considering following suit. California may enact a statewide ban if Gov. Gavin Newsom signs the Body Camera Accountability Act this summer. The Somerville City Council in Massachusetts banned facial recognition just this week.
While these cities are turning their backs to this technology, others are welcoming it. The Orlando Police Department is testing Amazon’s 'Rekognition' software, although not in public or for investigative use. According to the New York Times, Detroit signed a $1 million deal to set up facial recognition in the city’s surveillance cameras with broad rules on how law enforcement can use the footage.
Bill Johnson, executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, compares facial-recognition software to when law enforcement started using DNA testing as an investigative tool.
“There was a lot of concern then as well about ‘the government is going to have my DNA, they’re going to know all about me, how is this going to be used?’ and I think today those fears have generally gone by the wayside,” Johnson said.
Privacy and who's tracking you: Apple, Google, Amazon and their tracks
Johnson says facial recognition can be utilized in the same way DNA testing is — to confirm identities, solve crimes and exonerate the innocent.
“I don’t think it’s providing the government any more identification (information) than they already have,” said Johnson. “I think if people are concerned about surveillance, they’ve kind of missed the boat. ”
Facial recognition is being used by more than law enforcement. The New York school district will be the first in the country to deploy the software for added security, including to identify potential school shooters and sex offenders.
“AI is so powerful, it is going to be either the greatest or the worst thing we as a human species has ever developed, and using such a powerful tool, I think the developers of that should have a mechanism of objective, interested people they can rely on to say, ‘Just because we can do this, should we?’” Bueermann said.

Texto completo: Sen. Steve Daines sent a letter Friday to the federal agency that oversees nursing homes, asking about issues raised in a recent New York Times story on some poor-performing homes being backed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The June 24 Times story by Matthew Goldstein and Robert Gebelhoff noted 74 nursing homes listed among 478 identified in a recent report of having "serious deficiencies" have HUD-guaranteed mortgages.
Daines asked Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials if it coordinates with HUD as it oversees the program known as "Special Focus Facility," of SFF, for poor performing homes. He also asked what information was shared.
One of the loans was to Genesis Healthcare, which manages 400 nursing homes nationwide, the Times reported, adding their 60-bed Deer Lodge facility was among their nine homes on the CMS list.
"I am proud of the high-quality nursing homes operating in Montana that provide critical services to seniors and people with disabilities across the state," the Montana Republican wrote in his letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma. "I am however concerned about reported incidences of older adults receiving substandard care in nursing homes in Montana and nationwide and want to make sure that there are appropriate processes in place to prevent abuse and improve care in facilities that are not performing well."
He said he welcomed the news that CMS will begin publicizing the list of poor performing nursing homes eligible for CMS' Special Focus Facility (SFF) program.
"This is a step in the right direction that will help families as they make the decision to seek nursing home services for a loved one," Daines wrote.
There are 88 "participants" on the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program nationwide and 455 "candidates," according to the report, "Families' and Residents right to know: Uncovering poor care in America's nursing homes." The report was released June 3 by U.S. Sens. Bob Casey, a Republican, and Democrat Pat Toomey, both of Pennsylvania.
According to the list, the Crest Nursing Home in Butte is on the SFF program as a participant. "Candidates" are the Big Sky Care Center in Helena, Awe Kualawaache Care Center on Crow Agency, Heritage Place in Kalispell, Deer Lodge in Deer Lodge and the state-run Montana Mental Health Nursing Care Center in Lewistown.
Daines sent a letter to CMS on May 3, asking when a review will be completed of nursing home regulations and guidelines.

Texto completo: When Nashville data engineer Taylor Murphy and his wife welcomed their now 1-year-old son, Owen, last year, Murphy was offered 12 weeks of paid leave from his Silicon Valley employer GitLab. He took less than two.
Among his reasons: He was six months into his job, he had recently received a promotion, he had just hired two new employees, and he wanted to be available as they started.
When he told his new hires about taking a short leave, he advised them to do it differently — if or when they become parents.
"I said, 'Look, I know I am setting a bad example. I would encourage you to take more time,' " Murphy said. "If we have another child, I do plan on taking more time."
Paid parental leave for fathers is increasing nationally, with 29% of employers offering paid paternity leave in 2018, up from 12% in 2014. But many new fathers are reticent to take advantage of their employers' more generous policies, according to 2017 and 2018 SHRM Employee Benefits reports. Just more than one-third of male employees took all of their paid leave, half the rate of female employees; 40% of male employees used less than half of their available paid leave.
"There is pressure for men not to take paternity leave, even if a company has it written down in policy," said Elizabeth Gedmark of A Better Balance advocacy organization in Nashville. "If it's not something that upper management is encouraging, or if a man perceives that he is going to have any kind of career sacrifices, then often he won't take advantage of it."
For some men, they feel there is a stigma attached to taking a leave, evidenced by a stray comment made by a manager, Gedmark said. Or, if they don't see other men or secondary caregivers, especially managers, taking time off, they may be more reticent to take time away. Sometimes, it is a matter of timing — if they are in the middle of a big project, they might feel like taking time off is not feasible.
"Parental leave is taken after a very senior, high-profile male has taken it and it's been perceived they took it without consequence," said Jaime Klein, founder of Inspire Human Resources in New York. "The first male who is senior that either adopts or has a child has to take the leave. Once they do, the junior males will feel it is not as scary."
'We want you to have this time with your child and your spouse' Access to help from fathers after a child's birth boosted mothers' postpartum health, according to a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, reported on by The New York Times. An Institute for Women's Policy Research 2014 report found leave for fathers can lead to greater involvement with raising children beyond the leave period. It can also lead to greater gender equity at work by alleviating any penalties for women taking time off after a child's birth.
"When men start taking the leave, too, the stigma of taking that leave is removed for everyone, including women," said Christy Tosh Crider, who leads Baker Donelson's health care litigation group in the law firm's Nashville office.
Crider pushed to expand the law firm's parental leave policy in 2015 by adding three weeks of paid leave for secondary caregivers and by expanding paid leave to 16 weeks from 12 weeks for primary caregivers. The firm also added flexibility on when parents can choose to take their leave, allowing them to break it up instead of taking it all at once. Baker Donelson attorneys, primary and non-primary caregivers, are taking advantage, she said.
To make the new policy successful, the firm trained parental leave advisers — men and women — in each of the firm's offices to encourage use of and explain the policy to expectant parents. Crider also offered several sessions on the policy to practice group chairs and managing shareholders, educating them on the importance of encouraging the policy and showing them how client services would not be interrupted.
"Our leaders became big proponents of the policy," Crider said. "Some of them would pick up the phone for a non-primary caregiver who they knew had a spouse expecting and say, 'I expect you to take this leave. We offer it because we want you to have this time with your child and your spouse.' "
The policy change was business driven, as Crider explained to partners wondering how it would affect the firm financially and impact clients. Better policies would lead to greater loyalty and retention, which would improve client services. Lower turnover reduces costs. Offering and encouraging paid leave for secondary caregivers would also help achieve Baker Donelson's goal of making the firm a place where everyone who is motivated can succeed.
Crider said the flexibility aspect has been key to participation. If secondary caregivers choose to work some during the first three weeks of their child's life, they can use that time later — to take a child to a doctor's visit or stay home as their spouse transitions back to work.
Long-term benefits Similarly, Eventbrite offers flexibility on when new parents, both primary and secondary caregivers, access its 18-week paid leave policy. Company-wide, secondary caregivers have used between two and 18 weeks of leave. In Nashville, they have been more likely to use most of the time, but they tend to break it up — either into monthlong stretches or they have chosen to take off one day a week, said Erin Tomlinson, general manager of Eventbrite's Nashville office. Those who have adopted have used the time to travel to go get their children.
"People are very open to the benefit," Tomlinson said. "In the end, when you support your employees and they feel like they truly can have a work-life balance, they will be more productive and more happy and you will have less attrition. The immediate cost might seem high, but you have to look out across the long term."
Jerel Robinson, an Eventbrite senior manager of international sales in Nashville, said he was at first skeptical he would need so much time off, but he decided to embrace the opportunity after speaking with company leaders. He took a month off work when his son, Kyler, was born in October. He woke with him in the night, changed diapers, prepped bottles and picked out dad-themed onesies. He took another month off when he and his wife began training their son to sleep through the night and touring day cares, and he expects to take the remaining weeks in the next few months.
"My dad has been very involved with my life every step of the way. I want to be the same type of dad for my son," Robinson said. "If I wasn't there to take the time off and be there with my family and my wife, I would have missed so much."
A critical time for bonding Jacob Brown, a human resources business partner at Mars Petcare in Franklin, described his six weeks of paid leave as critical to bonding with his now 2-year-old son. He had been apprehensive about becoming a father and described his early efforts as "robotic" or "clinical," more following the correct steps of care.
It wasn't until the fourth or fifth week that he felt like he experienced the joys of fatherhood and appreciated the closeness he felt with this new presence in his life.
"There was this weird shift, intrinsically, where I was able to connect with him, find some joy and happiness," he said. "In week six, it was a full 180 from where I was before the birth. Without that time at home to support each other and get to know the child and connect differently, I don't know how long it would have taken me to get there."
Brown said he felt only encouragement from the top down, from women and men, to take the whole leave, and seeing others take full advantage influenced his own decision, he said.
For Mars, the benefits outweigh any business costs associated with six weeks of leave.
"We believe strongly that engaged associates, associates who have the opportunity to have a balance and flexibility within work and life, tend to be associates who are happier," said Dave Bradey, Mars' vice president of people and organizations.
"They give more."

Texto completo: MADRID - France experienced heat never seen in the country's recorded history Friday as a heat wave pushed the temperatures to nearly 115 degrees Fahrenheit in one southern village.
The spell of unusually warm weather stretched across much of Europe last week, bringing urgent government alerts, setting off wildfires in Spain and Germany and leading to the death of at least two people.
While experts have yet to draw a firm connection between this relatively early - and extreme - heat wave and global warming, it fits a clear overall trend. As greenhouse gas emissions lead to a rise in global temperatures, heat waves around the world are occurring more often, and they are hotter and last longer.
Temperatures were well above 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40 degrees Celsius, in many parts of the continent, although the heat eased in Central and Eastern Europe on Friday. Meteorologists said temperatures were expected to drop across the continent in coming days.
Spain's official weather agency placed seven provinces under the highest heat alert level Friday. Such a "red alert" had been issued only once before in June, in 2015.
At least two deaths have been attributed to the weather in the past week, Spanish officials said: a 17-year-old farm laborer in Cordoba and an 80-year-old in Valladolid.
Hundreds of firefighters were struggling Friday to control a wildfire in Catalonia, Spain's northeastern region, after extreme temperatures caused mismanaged manure on a farm to ignite, officials said.
By midday, the fire had burned more than 16,000 acres. Nearby villages were evacuated, the Spanish defense ministry deployed aerial and land reinforcements, and firefighters had been sent from neighboring regions.
Miquel Buch, the Catalonian interior minister, told reporters on Friday morning that while firefighters were making progress, the day would prove particularly challenging as temperatures were expected to stay above 40 degrees Celsius.
"We're facing the worst day of this heat wave," Buch said, noting that the fire could destroy nearly 50,000 acres if not brought under control.

Texto completo: MÉXICO – Al cumplirse un año de su victoria en los comicios, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, usa los micrófonos como si fueran bombonas de oxígeno.
El contacto diario con los medios de comunicación es esencial en su forma de gobernar y, por el camino, el mandatario ha dejado algunas frases memorables:
– “Abrazos, no balazos”
Todo un clásico desde la campaña electoral, casi un mantra de cara al público sobre el que levitan sus intenciones de pacificar el país. En contraste, la presencia de la Guardia Nacional -un nuevo cuerpo de seguridad- ha sido vista como una contradicción a esta frase mítica.
– “Me canso, ganso”
Un popular apunte del líder del Movimiento Regeneración Nacional (Morena) que provocó las risas -tanto cariñosas como hirientes- entre los mexicanos. La usa para dejar clara su perseverancia a la hora de conseguir su objetivo de transformar México.
– “Yo tengo otra información”
La favorita del presidente cuando la prensa espeta datos o información contraria a su Gobierno. Con total confianza se le ha visto poner en duda a calificadoras financieras como Moody’s, Fitch Ratings o incluso al prestigioso diario estadounidense The New York Times.
– “La mafia del poder”
Según describe el filósofo esloveno Slavoj Zizek en su libro “En defensa de la intolerancia” (1998), el ejercicio político es auténtico cuando una “no parte” minoritaria pide ser “parte” rebelándose contra el grupo dominante.
En el caso de López Obrador, ese grupo dominante -al que finalmente derrocó- es “la mafia del poder”, un grupo de políticos y empresarios que durante décadas, asegura, controló México.
– “La prensa fifí”
Un término muy usado desde el arranque de legislatura, identificado inmediatamente como los periódicos que califica de conservadores y adversarios del presidente, del izquierdista Morena.
– “Primero los pobres”
“Por el bien de todos, primero los pobres”, exclamó el presidente durante su discurso de investidura en el hemiciclo del congreso de los diputados el 1 de diciembre de 2018.
Toda una declaración de intenciones sobre las prioridades de su Gobierno: eliminar la pobreza es erradicar el resto de males de México. Y que ha repetido en multitud de ocasiones desde entonces.
– “Limpiar las escaleras de arriba a abajo”
Una de las frases más socorridas del mandatario. Hace referencia a la limpieza de las instituciones, empezando por las altas esferas, para acabar con la corrupción que ha dominado el país durante los últimos años.
– “Me producen ternura, ternuritas”
De las más recientes, lanzada a sus adversarios con una media sonrisa entre pícara y retadora desde su bastión en Palacio Nacional.
“Me producen ternura, ternuritas”, dijo el mandatario, cuando manifestó que sentía cierta pena por la labor que ciertos opositores hacen cada día difundiendo calumnias sobre él.
– “No es mi fuerte la venganza”
Ante todo, la paz. Desde que arrancó su mandato, el líder izquierdista ha defendido que no realizará una caza de brujas contra expresidentes o altos funcionarios por presuntos casos de corrupción, y dijo que prefiere hacer borrón y cuenta nueva.
– “No tengo derecho a fallar”
La consciencia de responsabilidad y el enorme peso que asegura que acarrea sobre sus hombros se desprende de esta frase del presidente mexicano.
López Obrador es el primer líder de izquierdas en décadas que gobierna el país, y su ascenso vino a romper la dicotomía existente entre el otrora hegemónico Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) -que estuvo en el poder casi 70 años- y el Partido Acción Nacional (PAN).
Para López Obrador, no existe la opción de fallar a las más de 30 millones de personas que le entregaron su voto en busca de un cambio

The Court Mitch McConnell Built

Texto completo: Mitch McConnell openly celebrated the Supreme Court's landmark 5-to-4 ruling on Thursday that declared the court had no power to interfere in excessively partisan gerrymandering. He had earned his victory lap. After all, Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and Senate majority leader, created the current court to deliver precisely that sort of outcome.
His audacious decision in February 2016 to prevent President Barack Obama from filling the vacancy caused by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia contributed significantly to the election of Donald Trump as president, allowing Mr. McConnell to oversee the Senate confirmations of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.
They were, predictably, two of the five justices in the conservative majority that refused to rein in wildly partisan redistricting, despite acknowledging that such tactics threaten to subvert democracy. Under the Constitution, policing gerrymandering is the job of the political system, not the judicial one, the five Republican-nominated justices said.
"This is a good example of how a strict constructionist would look at an issue," Mr. McConnell said about the ruling, which will clearly benefit the Republicans who control most of the state legislatures that will draw political maps using the 2020 census. "The founding fathers of this country were not ambiguous about who would do redistricting."
A Supreme Court that included Merrick B. Garland, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit -- Mr. Obama's 2016 nominee -- very likely would have decided the districting case very differently.
You can bet that this will not be the last end-of-term 5-to-4 vote in a politically charged Supreme Court decision. The justices like to say they don't wear party identification on their robes. But the party label of the president who made the nomination is becoming a dependable indicator of how a Supreme Court justice will rule. And that is particularly clear in the major cases arising out of the political and cultural divisions of the moment.
"Today's partisan split is anything but a flash in the pan," the legal scholars Neal Devins and Lawrence Baum wrote in their book, "The Company They Keep," arguing that the justices are heavily influenced not only by who appoints them, but also their own elite social networks. "It now defines the court and will likely play a key role in court decision making for the foreseeable future."
At the moment, there appears to be one wild card preventing the court from tipping over into all-out partisanship: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who abhors talk of the court as a political body.
"People need to know that we are not doing politics," he said in a speech earlier this year at Belmont University College of Law in Nashville. "They need to know that we're doing something different, that we're applying the law."
In previously navigating a way to uphold the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice Roberts had given every indication that he was worried about the court's image.
He acted similarly last week in joining the four justices nominated by Democrats in writing an opinion that sent back to a lower court a politically inflammatory case about whether to add a question about citizenship to the coming census. The question is viewed as a backdoor effort by the Trump administration to undercount minorities and dilute their political influence.
Chief Justice Roberts seemed to recognize that allowing the court to deliver two major political victories for Republicans would have fueled increasing Democratic mistrust of the Supreme Court. But in trying to maintain the court's reputation -- however tarnished -- of judicial nonpartisanship, he underscored just how political the court has become.
The chief justice's efforts to steer the court through partisan shoals is likely to get even more difficult as the justices are called upon to referee hot-button issues left unaddressed by partisan dysfunction in Congress and the White House.
Complicating his task is the fact that the other four conservatives -- Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. -- seem to be forming a power center not easily influenced by the chief justice. If President Trump were able to replace one of the remaining liberals on the court, it would fortify a conservative majority that would not need the chief justice's vote. And Democrats, with the changes in nomination rules imposed by both parties over the past six years, would have no power to stop it.
All of this makes this moment seem particularly perilous for the court. Though it has long been held in higher esteem than the other two branches, a growing number of Americans see it as infected by partisanship -- and are questioning its legitimacy. In the eyes of many, Democrats in particular, the stonewalling of Judge Garland that led to Justice Gorsuch's nomination and the accusations of sexual misconduct against Justice Kavanaugh have tainted both men's confirmations.
As has long been noted, the Supreme Court has no army to enforce its rulings. Its legal -- and moral -- authority stems almost entirely from the willingness of Congress, the president and the American public to accept its decisions. What might happen if that authority dissipates?
If, for instance, the court overturns a major precedent -- say, the Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion -- or is seen as relentlessly working to consolidate Republican political power, Democrats in Congress will feel increasing pressure to act. Some Democratic presidential candidates have already proposed plans for restructuring the court.
One widely discussed idea would be to abolish lifetime tenure and establish term limits for justices, to dilute the influence of any individual president. Pete Buttigieg, one of those Democratic candidates, has proposed creating a 15-member court with five members chosen by Republicans, five by the Democrats and five chosen by the other 10. Some Democrats have called for expanding the number of seats on the court to offset the conservative bloc. And yet another idea, seemingly embraced by Senator Bernie Sanders during the Democratic presidential debate, would establish a rotating corps of justices.
"I do not believe in packing the court," Mr. Sanders said. "But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. And that brings in new blood into the Supreme Court."
But none of these ideas, of course, stand a chance unless the Democrats capture the White House and both houses of Congress, since Republicans are happy with the court as it is.
Mr. McConnell did offer one concession. If a Democrat wins the White House in 2020 and Republicans still control the Senate, he will consider bringing a Supreme Court nominee before the Senate if a vacancy occurs early in the new president's term.
"I can't imagine any scenario under which in the early part of any president's term you would not have a vote," Mr. McConnell said. Then he offered an important caveat. A vote, he said, "doesn't mean the person will necessarily be confirmed."
Mr. McConnell will not easily relinquish control over the court he was so instrumental in shaping.

Nikola Mirotic reportedly to leave NBA to play in Spain

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — For well over a year now, Nikola Mirotic is a name that has often come up as a player who could end up on the Utah Jazz.
Multiple reports surfaced before the 2018 trade deadline (early February) that a deal was possible, and then chatter returned before the deadline this year. As Mirotic's contract is now up, he has been talked about recently as a player the Jazz would target in free agency over the coming days.
But it will not be happening, as The Athletic's Shams Charania first reported Saturday that Mirotic will be leaving the NBA altogether to play for Spain power Barcelona.


Born in Montenegro, Mirotic is a naturalized citizen of Spain after he played there from 2008-2014 before going to the NBA.
New York Times NBA reporter Marc Stein tweeted Saturday that Utah was in fact interested in signing the 28-year-old to a contract worth about $15 million per season. Such a deal would have meant that the Jazz would have to decline the team option on veteran Derrick Favors.


The 6-foot-10 Mirotic has averaged 12.3 points on 36% shooting from behind the 3-point line during his NBA career. That shooting ability at the power forward position is something Utah is thought to be interested in adding.
Elsewhere, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported Saturday that the Denver Nuggets will pick up the $30 million team option on former Jazzman Paul Millsap.
The team announced it about an hour later.
There was some question whether or not the Nuggets would pick up the option or try to sign the Louisiana Tech product to a longer deal for less money annually. They would have risked losing him in free agency, however, and again, Utah was a team that some thought could try to add the veteran.
Wojnarowski reported that Denver will also extend a qualifying offer to 2016 Jazz draftee Trey Lyles, who was sent to the Nuggets in the trade for Donovan Mitchell. Doing that makes Lyles a restricted free agent, meaning Denver can match any offer Lyles might get from another team.
Free agency officially opens at 4 p.m. MT on Sunday.

SELF-INFLICTED MEDICAL MISERY RED AMERICA'S HOMEMADE RURAL HEALTH CRISIS

Texto completo: Last weekend, The Washington Post published a heart-rending description of a pop-up medical clinic in Cleveland, Tenn. - a temporary installation providing free care for two days on a first-come-first-served basis. Hundreds of people showed up many hours before the clinic opened, because rural America is suffering from a severe crisis of health care availability, with hospitals closing and doctors leaving.
Because the focus of the report was on personal experience, not policy, it's understandable that the article mentioned only in passing the fact that Tennessee is one of the 14 states that still refuse to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. So I'm not sure how many readers grasped the reality that America's rural health care crisis is largely - not entirely, but largely - a direct result of political decisions.
The simple fact is that the Republicans who run Tennessee and other "non-expansion" states have chosen to inflict misery on many of their constituents, rural residents in particular. And it's not even about money: The federal government would have paid for Medicaid expansion.
So if rural America is suffering, a large part of the explanation is gratuitous political cruelty. This cruelty has denied health insurance to millions who could have had it with a stroke of the pen. And rural hospitals are closing, rural doctors leaving, in large part because people can't afford to pay for care.
To see what I mean, just compare Tennessee with its neighbor Kentucky. As recently as 2013, just before the Affordable Care Act went into full effect, the two states looked similar in terms of health care: In both states, about 20% of nonelderly adults lacked insurance. But unlike Tennessee, Kentucky did expand Medicaid, and it also did its best to make Obamacare work.
The result was a two-thirds drop in the uninsurance rate. At the same time, progress in Tennessee was far more limited. At this point, adults in Tennessee are twice as likely as their neighbors to lack health insurance.
And the divergence in destinies was even greater for rural residents. According to a Georgetown University study that covered a seven-year period spanning the introduction of the ACA, the percentage of low-income rural adults without health insurance fell 27 points in Kentucky, only 6 points in Tennessee.
Of course, if the U.S. were like every other wealthy nation, and provided some kind of universal health care, there would be no uninsured at all. Those heart-rending scenes in Cleveland would be inconceivable anywhere else in the advanced world. But the ACA isn't a future aspiration, it's an already-existing program - and a lot of rural America's medical misery could be avoided if states like Tennessee were willing to take advantage of that program.
And we're not just talking about having insurance; we're talking about whether there are doctors and hospitals available to provide care. True, rural hospitals have been closing in many states as the nonmetropolitan population declines. But a project that tracks rural hospital closings since 2010 finds that a great majority have taken place in states that didn't expand Medicaid. Four rural hospitals have closed in California, but 17 have closed in Texas. Tennessee has had three times as many closings as Kentucky.
The point is that much of the collapse of rural health care could have been avoided, and could be easily reversed, if so many state governments hadn't chosen to impose misery on their own rural constituents.
While rural Americans often tell reporters that they feel neglected and ignored by big-city coastal elites, the people preventing them from getting health care aren't in New York or D.C., they're in their own state capitals. And these state politicians hold power in large part thanks to the strong Republican leaning of rural voters.
But why are Republican state-level politicians so determined to punish their own base? As I said, it's not about the money: Rejecting the Medicaid expansion actually costs a state jobs and hence revenue.
Some of it may reflect the general meanspiritedness, the embrace of cruelty, that was already infecting the GOP even before Donald Trump, and has now become one of the party's defining traits. Yes, that's harsh, but you know that it's true.
There's also, I suspect, an element of cynical calculation. As I said, rural voters often complain that national elites don't care about their needs. Well, one way to make people feel hostile toward those elites is to block their access to federal benefits, and hope they don't realize who's actually causing their misery.
Is it conceivable that conservative politicians have that much contempt for their base? Yes.
In any case, the point is that while rural decline in general is a hard problem, with no easy answers, rescuing rural health care isn't hard at all. We know how to ensure that rural Americans get the health care they need. This isn't a problem of policy, it's a problem of politics - and most of the blame lies with Republican state governments.

Texto completo: New York City is geographically contained but still had a population of 8.623 million in 2017. It is expensive to get around.
The revenue in the area from tolls on roads and bridges is about $1.5 billion per year. New York and New Jersey collect about 30 percent of all the tolls nationwide. The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art is about 2,000,000 square feet with an amazing variety of exhibits.
We met my niece and her son, who live in Manhattan, at the Met where she, a member, treated us to a delightful late lunch in the fourth floor dining room. My wife and I toured the museum or parts of it for several hours. It would take days to see it all. We were exhausted.
A painting of Georgia O'Keefe's was displayed. It was a grey scene of the East River and industry viewed from her residence at the Sheldon Hotel when she lived there in the early 30's. The commentary suggested the concern displayed for the industrial pollution was a factor in her leaving later for New Mexico, where she lived in Abiquiu and painted flowers and landscapes.
Some of the commentary at the Met seemed very insightful and helpful and other seemed to be pretentious nonsense. We enjoyed the Jackson Pollock paintings for what they are. I'm not sure I get the profundity of splashing and dripping paint on a canvas on the floor.
Georgia O'Keefe and her artistic sisters issued in the age of modernism for creative women. A picture by another woman artist of the time depicted towers encased in scaffolding, signaling entrapment, according to the Met.
I agreed with that and noted that that painting was her last large work before committing suicide in 1963.
From research on Georgia O'Keefe, I noted she suffered from depression, likely brought on by the continuing infidelity of her husband. Many talented and successful artists seem to have been troubled, some seriously, during their lives. I'm not sure what to make of that.
My niece's son goes to top-rated Stuyvesant High School, where admission is controlled strictly by test. The student body is about 70 percent Asian and 30 percent white. Consideration is underway to combine other factors with test scores to increase diversity.
The visitors to the Met when we were there were largely Asian and white. There seemed to be few black artists displayed, although we could well have missed them and there was an African and Pacific Islands section. I would suppose that school kids tour the Met and that expands the cultural access and exposure.
According to a September 28, 2016 New York Times article, the Met is facing financial challenges and considering reducing some of its 2000 staff members and the number of annual exhibits from 50 odd to 40.
A new fundraising campaign was being planned. I am not into the finances of the Met other than to observe that massive spending is required to produce exhibits on such a grand scale. Some 7 million visitors a year are attracted.
The Deming-Luna-Mimbres Museum economically promotes and records the local history and traditions.
And that may be more relevant to locals than a visit to the Met. Maybe smaller, more focused, easier to access and tour museums would reach more people in a relevant way, although the grandeur of Met is impressive.

Texto completo: TOKYO - Kim Kardashian West's latest product is not yet available to buy, but the backlash is already here.
A day after a new line of slimming undergarments called Kimono Solutionwear was announced, some Japanese people expressed their displeasure with the reality star's use of the word kimono to sell her latest product. They accused her of appropriating an item - and an idea - central to Japanese culture in an attempt at cute wordplay and consumerism.
Kardashian West announced the project Tuesday on Twitter, saying it was coming soon. The product, which does not resemble a kimono, is shapewear for women in nine different shades and an array of sizes that is intended to help women feel more confident.
"Finally I can share with you guys this project that I have been developing for the last year. I've been passionate about this for 15 years. Kimono is my take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work, she wrote.
In Japan, the word kimono, which means "thing to wear on the shoulders is a central part of national culture. It is a gown that is tied with a sash and has been worn by men and women alike for generations.
On social media, angry users accused the reality star of disrespecting Japanese culture and stealing the name of their traditional dress.
"This is blasphemy against Japanese culture. Can't someone from kimono-related organizations protest? This is terrible, tweeted Masahito Sato, an editor and writer.
Many used the hashtag #KimOhNo to express their disgust and disappointment.
"Kim, I'm sure your shapewear's nice, but please don't take the name of a beautiful, traditional Japanese wardrobe and use it for your undies, one user wrote.
Kardashian West calls her new brand "a solution focused approach to shape enhancing underwear. According to the BBC, she trademarked the Kimono brand last year in the United States and has also filed trademarks for "Kimono Body, "Kimono Intimates and "Kimono World.
Yoshifumi Nakazaki, the deputy director general of the Japan Kimono League, said the kimono was a "common asset for all Japanese people.
"It's not just kimono as clothes but kimono as a name that is the common asset, not just for those of us who live in the modern era but for the history of Japanese people that has been accumulated over the years, he said in an interview. "Generally speaking, it is unthinkable for a Japanese person to register kimono for a trademark. That would be impossible.
Sarah Owie, another writer, said she was sad to see Japanese culture "threatened and that Kardashian West had gone "OVER LIMIT.
This is not the first time the Kardashian sister has been accused of cultural insensitivity. In 2017 she was accused of wearing blackface during the launch of her KKW Beauty range. A photo posted to social media at the time showed an extremely tanned-looking Kardashian West promoting her new Contour and Highlight Kit.
"I would obviously never want to offend anyone, she later told the New York Times. "I used an amazing photographer and a team of people. I was really tan when we shot the images, and it might be that the contrast was off.

Flap highlights Cracker Barrel's push for diversity

Texto completo: It was so bad at Cracker Barrel in the early aughts that the U.S. Justice Department forced the company into a plan to end discrimination that violated the Civil Rights Act, including turning away black customers.
Even as recently as the 2016 election season, political pundits used the company as shorthand, referring to Cracker Barrel vs. Whole Foods counties. The implication meant rural at best and backward or alienated at worst.
So it was a surprise to many last week when Cracker Barrel came out with a crystal-clear denunciation of LGBTQ discrimination, issuing a strongly worded statement about why it had banned Knoxville pastor Grayson Fritts and his church members from using a Tennessee Cracker Barrel as a meeting place.
"At Cracker Barrel, we work hard to foster a culture that is welcoming and inclusive — we have a zero-tolerance policy for discriminatory treatment or harassment of any sort," the release said. "We take pride in serving as a home away from home for all guests and in showing our communities and our country that the hospitality we practice is open to everyone."
Fritts seized the national spotlight last week after the Knoxville News Sentinel reported about a sermon the Knox County sheriff's detective delivered while off-duty that called for the government to arrest and execute members of the LGBTQ community.
The spotlight turned from Fritts to Cracker Barrel after the company's swift response last week to his plans for a meeting at a Cleveland, Tenn., location, and it illuminated a company that has made a surprising cultural turnaround that rejects discrimination of the sort it practiced in the 1990s and 2000s.
"We believe it's crucially important to foster this environment for our employees for many reasons," Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Janella Escobar told the News Sentinel on Thursday. "The guest experience should never exceed the employee experience, because our success begins with the employee experience.
"Happy employees create happy guests," she added. "We want our employee community to reflect the diversity of the communities we serve."
Dollars flow as diversity grows Those aren't just PR-friendly words. Since CEO Sandra Cochran took over in 2011, Cracker Barrel's stock has skyrocketed from about $40 a share to around $170, an increase of about 325%. Cracker Barrel has opened 31 new stores in the past five years, including seven this year.
Some social media critics have pilloried the company for selling out to political correctness, but many more restaurant customers, political figures and even a soda company praised the restaurant for taking a stand.
In a letter to Cracker Barrel, state Democratic Party Chairwoman Mary Mancini praised the Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain's progress under Cochran.
"Since you have taken over as CEO of Cracker Barrel, there has been a noticeable improvement in the culture," Mancini wrote. "The restaurants have become a more hospitable place for all Tennesseans, regardless of who we are, what we look like, etc."
Not long ago, Cracker Barrel would never have been held up as a model for inclusivity.
In 1991, the chain made headlines for ordering the dismissal of LGBTQ employees, according to a New York Times article. The company did not adopt language including the LGBTQ community into its anti-discrimination policy until 2002.
Former employees and customers sued Cracker Barrel several times for racial discrimination and racial and sexual harassment.
A 2004 Justice Department investigation found 50 of the restaurant chain's stores were segregating customer seating by race, serving white customers ahead of black customers or altogether refusing service to black customers.
That led to the company's five-year agreement with the Justice Department to implement nondiscrimination practices.
Huge gains in diversity scores Now, each Cracker Barrel restaurant prominently displays nondiscrimination signs, and Escobar said the company "actively focuses" recruitment efforts on "ensuring a multicultural and diverse employee base at all levels of the company."
The restaurant chain's scores on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index have more than doubled, increasing from a score of 35 when Cochran joined the company to a score of 75 this year. In 2008, the company's score was 15.
Cochran is the second woman in Tennessee to hold the office of CEO in a publicly traded company, and was named the National Organization for Workforce Diversity's 2016 CEO of the Year.
Three of Cracker Barrel's 10 board directors are women, and one is a person of color. Three women are also on the corporation's executive team.
The company boasts several employee resource groups focusing on gender, cultural and generational diversity, veterans and LGBTQ awareness and inclusivity. The LGBTQ resource group was named Out & Equal's 2018 LGBTQ Employee Resource Group of the Year.
Diversity effort includes suppliers, too Cracker Barrel also advertises a supplier diversity program. Escobar said the company does not release specific data on its suppliers, but said it has increased its spending with female-owned businesses by 130% since 2013 through partnerships with women and multicultural-focused nonprofit supplier diversity groups.
The company sponsors conferences and summits for the NAACP and has been a partner for the Middle Tennessee Diversity forum.
Additionally, Escobar said, the company works with the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Conexión Américas, the National Urban League and the Nashville LGBT Chamber of Commerce.
The corporation participates annually in Nashville's Pride Festival and supports the Out & Equal Workplace Summit, Escobar said.

No, the DOJ isn’t supporting Christian conservatives at the expense of other religious groups

Texto completo: For the second time in two months, a writer at a major newspaper has painted religious liberty advocates as merely abusing their cause as a guise for bigotry. A USA Today op-ed published this week claimed that “The Trump Justice Department has turned 'religious liberty' into a license to discriminate.” This seems to mirror a similar article which recently ran in the New York Times entitled “We are Taking Religious Freedom Too Far.”
The author of the USA Today article, Michael J. Stern, a 25-year veteran of the Department of Justice, claims that not only is the DOJ siding with religious liberty advocates in an apparently problematic majority of cases (Imagine the DOJ siding with the First Amendment — how archaic), but also that DOJ only sides with conservative Christian religious liberty claims, not those involving other faiths.
“While the Trump Justice Department has bent over backwards to protect the ‘religious liberty’ of countless Christian organizations, its efforts have been less charitable to non-Christians. When a Native American tribe raised religious objections to a South Dakota pipeline that would infringe on sacred lands, DOJ offered no support.”
This is misleading. In March, for instance, the DOJ filed in support of a lawsuit from the Ramapugh Mountain Indians alleging the Township of Mahwah violated the tribe’s religious rights. Clearly, Trump’s DOJ isn’t just supportive of religious freedom for Christians.
Stern also argued that the Trump administration doesn’t care about religious freedom for Muslims, yet this too is not so.
In April, the DOJ and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas reached an agreement with the City of Farmersville, Texas, to resolve a dispute alleging that the city violated the religious freedom of the Islamic Association of Collin County by denying their application to build a cemetery. That fact was apparently too inconvenient for the progressive narrative to be included in this USA Today op-ed.
Stern concluded by saying “If the first year of DOJ’s religious liberty task force has taught us anything, it is that there is little more than pretext at the core of its policies on religious freedom.” He then threw out a few outlandish hypothetical examples to try and hammer this point home.
Stern asked: “What will DOJ do when the owner of the most trendy restaurant in Washington, D.C., asserts a life of biblical adherence as justification for his refusal to serve well-known adulterers in Congress or the White House?”
Well, if the past is any indication of the future, the DOJ will attempt to be as fair and respectful of the First Amendment as they can possibly be.
Matt Sharp, legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, told me via e-mail:
“The ability to freely live, speak, and work according to deeply held religious beliefs is the bedrock of liberty and our country. This essential freedom applies to every American of any faith – Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, any other faith or no faith at all. The Department of Justice has a duty to safeguard this freedom, and the Department under the Trump Administration has consistently done so. To report or convey that these actions are anything but fortifying constitutional freedoms for all Americans is sad, misguided rhetoric.”
The real problem isn’t the DOJ, it’s people like Stern who cherry pick so-called discriminatory cases guised as religious freedom causes, and leave out the work that the DOJ is doing that would tear his thesis apart. In fact, it kind of sounds like Stern wants to leave religious conservatives out in the cold. Who’s the bigot now?

Two women E. Jean Carroll told about alleged sexual assault by Trump step forward

Texto completo: The two women whom E. Jean Carroll confided in about her alleged sexual assault by President Trump at the time it happened came forward to tell their side of the story.
Carol Martin and Lisa Birnbach both went public in an interview with the New York Times that included Carroll, describing Carroll telling them about the assault.
Carroll, 75, accused Trump in an early release of an excerpt of her book of sexually assaulting her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in 1995 or 1996.
"‘He pulled down my tights. He pulled down my tights,’” Birnbach recalled Carroll saying in the interview, which was released Thursday. Birnbach said initially both the women were laughing until she realized that what Carroll was describing was rape.
“Honestly, you did say, ‘He put his penis in me,’” Birnbach said. "And I said, 'What, he raped you?'"
Birnbach said she told Carroll to go to the police but she refused. Carroll described how she viewed the incident in the interview at the time: "It was a fight. It was not a crime," saying she does not choose to remember it as a rape.
Martin said her response to the incident was different from Birnbach. She told Carroll not to tell anyone because Trump was a powerful man.
The women said that after these two separate conversations, the two of them never talked about the incident again.
Photo Caption:E. Jean Carroll is photographed, Sunday, June 23, 2019, in New York. Carroll, a New York-based advice columnist, claims Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. Trump denies knowing Carroll.

Texto completo: Earlier this month, my column covered bond basics – how they work and their proper purpose in a blended growth portfolio. But many see a 100% (or very heavy) bond portfolio as a set-it-and-forget-it safe income generator.
Considering various risks shows why bonds alone rarely are best for retirement cash flow.
1. Interest rate risk.
Bond prices and interest rates move oppositely. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Rates will probably increase little in 2019, but when they do, selling before maturity (to meet an expense, perhaps) locks in losses.
2. Credit risk
Otherwise called default risk – the potential that a bond issuer reneges on the contract. When the issuer can’t make interest or principal payments, they default. Depending where you sit in a bankruptcy pecking order, you may not get your money back. When Greece defaulted in 2012, bondholders suffered huge losses. Higher credit risk bonds carry high-interest rates – alluring – but that simply balances the higher likelihood of loss.

3. Liquidity risk
With individual bonds rather than a bond fund, you can hit trouble when it’s selling time. Many bonds – particularly corporate and municipal issues – don’t trade much. That can make them tricky to price and find buyers for. Most bonds aren’t like stocks, which trade daily on public exchanges. Selling can be more slippery than a politician’s pretty promises. You can’t sell in a flash near prices found online. Selling a “thinly” traded bond with few buyers can leave you forced to sell at steep discounts – particularly if there are no buyers and you need the proceeds fast for unexpected reasons.
4. Reinvestment risk
Owning high-interest bonds from low-risk issuers – and planning to hold them until they mature – may seem fool-proof. Yet even here, risks lurk. Many corporate bonds are “callable” – meaning the issuer can redeem them at will. Companies often do this when interest rates fall. Why keep paying the higher rate when they can call the bond at below market prices and float a cheaper new one? Good for them. Bad for you.
Even if your bond isn’t called, trouble can loom when it matures and you must replace that income stream. What if you can’t find something with a high enough yield? A 30-year U. S. Treasury bond from 30 years ago paid over 8% a year. Good luck finding that with low default risk now! America’s current 30-year yield is below 3%. You can’t even get near to 8% in Greece! Its 25-year debt pays just 4. 3%. You’d need a 30-year Mexican or Brazilian bond, skyrocketing credit risk.
5. Inflation risk
Few bonds have inflation-linked interest rates. Normally, interest is the same each year. When the bond matures, you get the exact face value back. Over time, even low inflation erodes the interest income’s purchasing power. Ditto for your principal. With a 10-year bond maturing now, the $1,000 you receive buys far less today than it did when issued in 2009. To maintain purchase power, your money must grow.
Don’t get me wrong. I like bonds. Unlike many investments, they are transparent, with definable risks, and respond exactly proportionally to those risks – unlike many non-transparent and complexly defined investments, say, many annuities (per my April 14 column).
So, they are a good tool but like any tool must be used correctly with eyes wide open on their risks.
Usually, that is done best as part of a bigger blended portfolio aimed at growth where the bonds’ role is, above all, to provide relative stability by dampening volatility.

3 reasons real estate is a lousy retirement investment: Location, location, location

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger “forever” homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I’ve ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don’t bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can’t buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn’t a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Paul Davidson’s story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Moving up: How to take the stress out of selling your house and buying another home
Farm crisis? Low prices, floods and trade wars plague American farmers, putting their survival at risk
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location. The housing market isn’t uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco’s property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That’s your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it’s cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren’t guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well. But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You’re betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You’re betting some hot new suburb won’t steal your hamlet’s thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don’t shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn’t stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn’t.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — The first Democratic debate took place last night with 10 presidential candidates sharing the stage for two hours. Here are some reactions from the debate.
CNN's Chris Cillizza noted how the debate didn't really feel like a full-blown debate due to the number of candidates.

- "With 10 candidates onstage, their answers limited to 60 seconds and most of the candidates unwilling to engage one another, the debate was less a debate than a series of one-minute speeches."

NPR's Domenico Montanaro said it was remarkable how the candidates barely talked about President Trump and instead focused on someone else.

- "It is remarkable that the candidates had relatively little to say about President Trump. It was almost as if he didn't exist — and the candidates cared more about Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell."

President Trump shared his thoughts over his prefered method of communication part way through the debate.

- https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1144056731653169152

Mitch McConnell , the "Grim Reaper" of progressive policies, reacted to the criticisms saying he was proud.

- "Being criticized for stopping the liberal agenda and confirming conservatives judges, I love it."

Beto O’Rourke spoke in Spanish during the debate, garnering interesting reactions on and off the stage.

Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted that after the debate, more Trump doesn't sound that bad.

Julian Castro's closing statement gained a lot of attention online that it was trending will into the next day.

New York Times columnist Gail Collins said Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar managed to stand out on the crowded stage.

- "Warren was very strong on the issues — her passionate attacks on big oil, big pharma and big private prison operators have really gotten sort of operatic. And Klobuchar had some of the best lines, including her critique on Donald Trump’s Iran agenda: 'I don’t think we should conduct foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5 in the morning.'"

With the next 10 presidential candidates debating tonight, U.S. citizens have a lot to think about for the next 495 days.

Texto completo: John Hodgman, Attica Locke, Kwame Alexander, Hafsah Faizal and more authors are coming to the Texas Book Festival this year, organizers announced Wednesday.
The festival revealed 15 authors in the first round of names from its 2019 lineup. The annual literary event — scheduled for Oct. 26-27 inside and around the Texas Capitol — brings author panels, discussions, book signings and more to Austin every fall.
Hodgman is a well-known humorist, coming to Austin for his new book, “Medallion Status: True Stories from Secret Rooms.” Book tickets for his session are now available at the Texas Book Festival website; they include a signed copy of the book and priority seating for the session. Seating for non-ticket holders will be limited and available the day of the event on a first-come, first-served basis.
Children’s fiction writer Alexander is a Newbery Medal winner, poet and New York Times bestselling author of 21 books, including the new picture book “The Undefeated,” intended to teach young readers about African American culture.
Faizal is a best-selling author of fiction for young adults, coming with the fantasy work “We Hunt the Flame.”
Locke, an author and producer of TV shows like “When They See Us” and “Empire,” will come to the festival with “Heaven, My Home,” the follow-up to her award-winning thriller, “Bluebird, Bluebird.”
Also on the lineup: Former University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven will appear to promote his new book, “Sea Stories: My Life in Special Operations.” Oscar Cásares will be in Austin with the novel “Where We Come From” (the American-Statesman’s pick for the Statesman Selects book series from May). Saeed Jones, formerly of BuzzFeed, will present his new memoir, “How We Fight for Our Lives,” a coming-of-age story blended with poetry and prose. Kristen Arnett, an award-winning essayist, is also set for the festival with her debut novel, “Mostly Dead Things.”
The other names revealed on the lineup are Aarti Namdev Shahani, author of “Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares”; Alexander McCall Smith, author of “To The Land of Long Lost Friends”; Ben Mezrich; author of “Bitcoin Billionaires”; Jericho Brown, author of “The Tradition”; Marie Arana, author of “Silver, Sword, and Stone: Three Crucibles in the Latin American Story”; Cassy Joy Garcia, author of “Cook Once, Eat All Week”; and Susan Choi, author of “Trust Exercise.” The full 2019 festival lineup will feature more than 250 writers and will be announced in the coming months.
Organizers on Wednesday also pulled back the curtain on this year’s poster, titled “Burgeoning.” Austin-based artist Dave McClinton designed the poster, a collage made from wrinkled paper, photographed and rendered as a mountain landscape.

Texto completo: In his statement on Russian interference during the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller said he "would not go beyond our report." Now, he will testify before Congress on July 17.
Although the report states the investigation didn't find collusion from the Trump campaign, Russian interference was seemingly rampant. As reported by The New York Times, 140 contacts existed between Trump's team, Russians and WikiLeaks. Among the possible obstructions of justice, one stands out: Donald Trump's attempt to fire Mueller. In 2017, Trump allegedly called then-White House counsel Don McGahn and "directed him to have the special counsel removed," according to Mueller's report. Trump denied the account, suggesting McGahn lied under oath.
Mueller's testimony may not be the silver bullet Democrats want, but it will shoot holes in the false narrative of "no collusion, no obstruction."

Turmoil at NRA deepens as top lobbyist resigns

Texto completo: Group also cuts ties with its advertising agency, and TV arm shuts down
The National Rifle Association plunged further into chaos Wednesday as its top lobbyist resigned, its television arm shut down and the organization severed all business ties with its longtime advertising agency.
Christopher W. Cox, who was on administrative leave, officially stepped down days after being accused in a lawsuit of participating in an alleged extortion scheme to oust the organization's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. Cox has denied the allegations.
LaPierre informed the NRA staff of Cox's resignation in an email. In it, he cited the allegations in the lawsuit as the reason Cox was placed on leave. He also thanked Cox for his years at the organization and his advocacy of Second Amendment rights.
Cox could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
Cox received about $1.1 million in compensation in 2017, the NRA's most recent tax filing shows. As second-in-command, he led the NRA's powerful political arm, which spent $30 million to help elect President Trump.
The resignation has sparked worry among some staffers and board members, who note that Virginia lawmakers are convening for a special session on gun control and that the Democratic presidential candidates are aggressively promoting anti-gun platforms.
Cox's departure comes as another potent NRA force has been closed. An NRA spokesman said NRATV - which sometimes streamed dire, dystopian programming that had nothing do to with guns - no longer exists. It had long been controversial, with one segment digitally adding Ku Klux Klan hoods to trains in the children's show "Thomas the Tank Engine," a criticism of the show's producers' trying to make its characters more diverse.
Numerous members of the NRA's board were concerned that NRATV strayed too far into politics and away from Second Amendment advocacy. Its shutdown was first reported by the New York Times.
NRATV was a collaboration between the organization and its longtime advertising agency, Ackerman McQueen, with which it is embroiled in several lawsuits.
"The NRA regrets that a longstanding, formerly productive relationship comes to an end in this fashion," NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote in a letter Tuesday to Ackerman chief executive Revan McQueen.
In a statement Wednesday, Ackerman accused the NRA of refusing to make good on millions of dollars in "delinquent payments" owed to the firm but said it was ready to break with the group.
"For Ackerman McQueen, it is time to move on to a new chapter without the chaos that has enveloped the NRA," the company said.
The changes come at a difficult time for the NRA. In April, LaPierre told the organization's board of directors that its then-president, Oliver North, would release a letter detailing a "devastating" account of the organization's finances if LaPierre did not step down. Cox is alleged to have participated in what the NRA calls that extortion attempt, according to the lawsuit filed last week against North.
North resigned, saying that the organization's finances were in "clear crisis."
The NRA is also facing a probe of its nonprofit status by the New York attorney general, and a congressional investigation.

Texto completo: I tapped on the door of his trailer somewhere around 4 a.m. I heard a "come on in" and as soon as I did, he handed me the phone. "Listen to this," he said with more than a hint of disgust in his voice.
The voice on the other end of the line was trying to explain his absence. "My transport vehicle broke down and I am two hours away," the driver said. "Were you not supposed to be here, now? Mr. Smith's appointment is at 8:15 a.m. in Tampa at the Moffitt Cancer Center," I replied.
Smith is being treated for one of those difficult to treat sarcoma cancers. The doctors have used radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. After a very rough year, it seemed he just might have prevailed in his fight.
At one point in time, it seemed the damage done by the treatments was too much for him to overcome, leaving him with a terrible choice of letting the cancer take him or letting the treatments due the deed. That is when the immunotherapy began working its magic, knocking the cancer back. The radiation and chemotherapy were suspended. He began to build his strength back. "The numbers are improving fast," he likes to say.
Losing a champion On Saturday, June 15, 2019, the day we were flying to the San Juan Islands, Jen Miller reported in her running column in the New York Times: "[T]he running world lost a good one. Gabriele Grunewald, a track champion, died of complications from cancer. She was 32." (https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/RU_14332.html).
I had read a couple of articles on this indomitable champion over the years and every one of them made me want to cry.
Her ferocious battle with a rare form of metastatic cancer, adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), and a thyroid cancer. The two stories are inseparable at least, since 2009, her senior year in college. While it is a story without a happy ending, Grunewald's courage and character are inspiring people everywhere making her foundation hashtags, @bravelikegabe and #bravelikegabe, immediately recognizable by thousands of runners.
ACC was first found in Grunewald's salivary gland in 2009 when she was a senior competing for the University of Minnesota. A lump was also found under her left ear. She was away at a track meet at Arizona State University when her doctor called to tell her she had an incurable disease that about 1,200 people are diagnosed with each year in the United States.
Cancers that are only diagnosed 1,200 times a year are not likely to attract many research dollars. It is an unfortunate truth that would make her struggle as much about her unwillingness to give in as about the search for a cure.
And yet, the day after receiving the phone call from her doctor, Grunewald ran a personal best time in the 1,500 meters. She followed that up with radiation treatments, surgery and more surgery before breaking the school (University of Minnesota where she walked on to the team) record in the 1500-meter race and finishing second at the NCAA championship.
Not long after that, a "curable" thyroid cancer knocked on the door and delivered another challenge. After extensive treatments, she responded in 2012 by running 4:07.38 to finish fourth in the 1,500-meter race, one spot from qualifying for the London Olympics.
After setting a new personal best in the 1500-meters in July 2013, Gabe won her first national title in 2014 in 3,000-meters at the US Indoor National Championships.
Courage of #bravelikegabe Grunewald's most remarkable effort may have been at the 2016 Rio Olympics trials. She first tried to make the team in the 5,000, but missed. She gave it another try in the 1,500 meters where her best was 4:01.48, a time reserved for elites. Her time in that competition of 4:18.73, leaving her completely out of contention, was a clear signal that something was going wrong again.
It also demonstrated her amazing strength — a four-pound tumor was removed from her liver. The cancer not only weakened her physically, but pressed against her diaphragm. And yet, she still refused to give in.
The fourth time a cancer appeared would be the last. Make time if you can to go to https://bravelikegabe.org/about-gabe and read more of the details of Gabe Grunewald's amazing story.
She explains:
"Throughout each new diagnosis and treatment, I have made the choice to run and train when my body allows. It hasn't always been easy, but it has always been the right decision for me.
From the very first day I was told I had cancer in 2009, I knew running would be a big part of my journey back to health. It has truly been my refuge; when everything else seems to be going wrong and the outcomes are far beyond my control, I can find perspective and hope on the run."
Hope for another fighter Without meeting Jim Smith, it is hard to get a full meaningful picture of him. He is no taller than four feet and his legs have pretty much stopped working. He has been blind since before his 15th birthday. Yet, he seems to have the ability to see far more than most people.
When our driver dumped us last time, it meant stuffing a wheelchair into the trunk of my car. For Jim, it also meant sitting in a much less comfortable position and being moved by my untrained hands and back. And yet, the smile never seems to leave his face. He still has hope for a good recovery, but on this trip we learned the cancer was growing again, maybe in as many as three places.
He is not, and as far as I know never has been a runner. But he is a fighter with a great attitude. Like Gabe Grunwald, he will not let the cancer take charge as long as he can fight.
As we hit the road to Tampa the skies began filling with rain clouds and soon it was pouring rain. On the way back, traffic on I-75 came to a halt for several hours after a crash that involved fatalities. I ran so low on gas, the car was effectively out of gas which created a whole new challenge.
Through it all Jim Smith could only say how much he appreciated the help.
Two lessons, I hope I can carry with me from two very strong people.
David Yon is addicted to running. In his spare time, he is an attorney with the Radey Law Firm.

Mark Meadows: DOJ exploring 'unbelievably unusual activity' in final months of Obama administration

Texto completo: Rep. Mark Meadows said the Justice Department is examining irregularities in the intelligence community as part of its review of the origins of the Russia investigation.
Reacting to newly released documents on changes in U.S. procedures for sharing raw intelligence, the Meadows said there was "unbelievably unusual activity" in the final months of the Obama administration.
"I can tell you that [U.S. Attorney] John Durham and Attorney General [William] Barr are going to get to the bottom of it," the North Carolina Republican said Monday evening on Fox News. "They are including in part of their surveillance — really looking at the intelligence community to make sure that justice is brought."

On Sean Hannity's show, before Meadows was brought on to speak along with colleague Rep. Jim Jordan, attorney Jay Sekulow discussed the latest findings by his conservative watchdog group, the American Center for Law and Justice.
The records obtained by the ACLJ showed the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Clapper pushing to increase access to raw signal intelligence before President Trump took office. The New York Times first reported the expanded access to intercepted communications in January 2017. Although Hannity and Sekulow played up the newly released records, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, as suspiciously timed and "rushed," the Times noted the discussions for such changes to remove bureaucratic barriers stretched back years dating back to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Still, Jordan said he suspects there was evidence of nefarious intent, tying the changes to an interview Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer did in January 2017 in which the New York Democrat warned then-incoming President Trump that intelligence officials "have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you."
"So this is one of those six ways," Jordan said, adding that the other "ways" include British ex-spy Christopher Steele's anti-Trump dossier the CIA's use of informants to make contact with members of the Trump campaign.
Barr tasked Durham, a U.S. attorney from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry focused on the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which the FBI began in the summer of 2016. The DOJ review of the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action.
Jordan noted how first Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is expected to wrap up his investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse and that could influence Durham's efforts. "The attorney general of the United States and U.S. Attorney John Durham are doing an investigation. And they have told us this is broader than just the FBI — they're going to look at all of this," Jordan said.
"First, Horowitz is going to come out. His report a year ago was very good," the Ohio Republican said. "Then we will see where Mr. Durham and Mr. Barr where their investigation and what they come back with."
The Justice Department's examination of the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign has been cheered by Republicans and criticized by Democrats. After Trump granted Barr sweeping powers to declassify secret information and instructed a handful of agencies to cooperate with his investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff panned the effort as a "disturbing" scheme to politicize intelligence.
A DOJ letter written to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler outlining the scope of its investigation said the review is "broad in scope and multifaceted" and includes a look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners.

YOUR DAILY DOSE OF OPTIMISM! THERE IS AN AMERICA THAT LIES BEYOND OUR CURRENT DESPAIR

Texto completo: Someone recently gave me a book of photos taken on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the 1890s. The conditions were horrible: homeless, malnourished children sleeping in a clump, barefoot in a doorway. There was a block, on Bayard Street, with 39 tenement houses, and 2,781 people squeezed into them. There were only 264 toilets on that entire block and no showers or baths. There were 441 rooms on that block with no ventilation, where people lived in the shadows, catching tuberculosis and diphtheria. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="5216">
My grandfather, Bernard Levy, grew up there, off Bayard Street, a few years later. He went to a public high school and a public college and rose to become a lawyer. He spent his evenings writing letters to the editor that he hoped would be printed in The New York Times. He didn't live to see me get a job here, but I am living out his dream. Our family life, from the Lower East Side upward, is a social mobility miracle.
When you grow up with this background, you have a deep sense of the goodness and purpose of America. America is the land of milk and honey. Lincoln could go from a log cabin to the White House. A Jewish boy from the Bronx named Ralph Lifshitz could grow up to become Ralph Lauren and redefine American preppy. You could be born on the fringes and assimilate into this new thing called an American.
I used to think we could revive that story for the 21st century, but we probably can't. Too many people feel left out of it. Plus, there is no longer a single American mainstream to serve as the structural spine of the nation. Mainline Protestantism is no longer the dominant religion and cultural force. The WASP establishment no longer rules the roost. There is no white majority in our kindergartens, and soon there will be no white majority in our society.
The big three TV networks no longer dominate the culture the way they did. There is no one dominant musical genre. The national ruling class has lost legitimacy. Social trust is strongest at the local levels, which grow more polarized from one another. Politically, we're in an age of extremes.
The reality and challenge is that America has become radically pluralistic. We used to be unipolar - one dominant majority culture and a lot of minority groups that defined themselves against it. Now we're multipolar. We're all minorities now.
That could blow us to smithereens. But who knows? We could learn to be minorities together, to be what Rabbi Jonathan Sacks calls creative minorities. In a brilliant 2013 lecture, Sacks noted that when Solomon's temple was destroyed and the Jews were cast into exile, the prophet Jeremiah had a surprising message: Go to new lands. Build houses. Plant gardens. Seek the peace and prosperity of the cities in which you settle.
Jeremiah was saying you don't need to assimilate into the new place. Nor do you need to withdraw into a culturally pure enclave. Instead, don't be afraid to be a distinct, orthodox version of yourself within a larger society. Build a rich moral community. Just don't try to universalize your faith or even become a dominant minority. Interact with the world around you, confident in your own particularity, but realize that every time you seek to dominate others, you will wind up dominated.
This stance - aggressive interaction without an attempt to be hegemonic - made the Jews creative in three ways, Rabbi Sacks argues.
First, the encounter with other cultures led to great flowerings of Jewish thought. Jews wrestled with the best ideas they encountered from outside. Second, Jews were often bridges between different civilizations. Through trade, they linked China and the West during the Middle Ages. Third, Jews emerged from their secure base and made great contributions to the wider world: Spinoza, Freud, Einstein, etc.
In a world of radical pluralism, we are all Jews. We have no choice but to build a mass multicultural democracy, a society that has no dominant center but is a collection of creative minorities.
Nearly 200 years ago, Tocqueville wrote that democracy was creating a new sort of man. Pluralism today is creating a new sort of person, especially among the young. They don't just relish diversity; they embody it. Many have mixed roots - say, half-French/half-Dominican. Many are border stalkers; they live between cultures, switch back and forth, and work hard to build a multiplicity of influences into a single coherent life. They're Whitmanesque, containing multitudes, holding opposite ideas in their minds at the same time.
Radical pluralism also necessitates retelling the nation's history. We've always been a universal nation, a crossroads nation, a nation whose very identity is defined by the fact that it is a hub for a dense network of minorities and subgroups, and the distinct way of life they fashion to interact and flourish together.
I used to think that America had to find a new unifying national narrative. Now I wonder if not having a single national narrative will become our national narrative.

Texto completo: A team of veteran reporters from the USA TODAY NETWORK's Northeast Metro Group teamed up to investigate who is getting the billions of dollars set aside to clean up the nation's closed and decommissioned nuclear plants and how that process is being handled. Our reporters who tackled the project:
Tom Zambito has been an investigative reporter with The Journal News/lohud and the USA TODAY NETWORK since August 2015.

In 2014, she was one of two Gannett reporters who were finalists in the Deadline Club's "Public Service Award" for their work on the Asbury Park Press' "Heroin at the Shore" series.
Christopher Maag is a columnist for The Record. His columns focus on the overlooked characters of New Jersey and the Northeast, bringing readers into the lives of a chopper-riding chihuahua, a convicted drug cartel strategist and the farmer whose field overlooks the Lincoln Tunnel. Formerly a regular contributor to The New York Times and TIME, he has written for daily newspapers, monthly magazines and alternative news weeklies, winning awards for writing and investigative reporting. A graduate of Columbia University School of Journalism, he lives in Queens.
Samantha Ruland is the Pennsylvania issues reporter for the York Daily Record and USA TODAY NETWORK.

Texto completo: It is an awful thing to call someone a liar. It breaks the social fabric. We expect that most people we know tell the truth. Saying they don't - that in essence we don't trust them - is an insult. Parents punish their children if they lie and warn them not to call anyone a liar.
The other day at Donald Trump's Florida rally in which he again announced he is running for re-election (he began his re-election campaign during the inauguration), one woman in particular was outraged that so many people believe he routinely lies. That's just a media fabrication, she stormed.
The Washington Post has a scorecard that has Trump caught lying 10,726 times that can be proved. The Toronto Star also keeps score. The New York Times keeps a record of his false claims and the facts. So does Buzz Feed. So do reporters and fact checkers and governments around the world.
Tony Schwartz, the biographer who wrote Trump's screed, "The Art of the Deal," says Trump lies about 80 percent to 90 percent of the time.
On many issues, Trump simply misstates the truth, embellishes it or exaggerates. That is not what we're talking about or what is so upsetting to people who take unraveling the threads of democracy seriously.
Lying is deliberately and knowingly saying something that is not true.
Trump tells lies about things that matter and things that can be proven. Here are just a few.
Trump repeatedly claims the Mueller report said there was no collusion with the Trump campaign and Russia. But the Mueller report did not say that. It said collusion is not a crime and was not investigated. Mueller did say that he was unable to say that Trump did not break the law and obstruct justice. He said there was a lot of evidence for obstruction of justice that Congress should investigate and then decide how to handle it. Proof? Read the report.
Trump rode to current fame not just on reality TV, telling celebrities they were "fired," but also by claiming Barack Obama was not born in the United States. That is not true and Trump had absolutely no proof that it was anything but a lie. Proof? Obama's Hawaiian birth certificate has been meticulously verified.
Trump said that the National Security Agency, the CIA and the FBI told Congress that Russia did not influence the 2016 election. That is not true. U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously agreed that Russia did interfere and is trying to meddle in the 2020 election as well. Proof: Read the Mueller report and the agencies' own statements to Congress.
Trump repeatedly says he got the most Electoral College votes of any president since Ronald Reagan. Trump got 304. George H.W. Bush got 426 in 1988. Bill Clinton got 370 votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996. Obama received 365 in 2008.
Trump claimed that thousands of people voted illegally in 2016 for Hillary Clinton because she had almost 3 million more votes than he did. He formed a commission to prove widespread fraud. The commission quietly disbanded without proving anything.
Trump has claimed that the rate of violent crime in the U.S. is the highest it's been in 45 or 47 years. In fact, according to the FBI, violent crime dropped 49% between 1993 and 2017.
Late last year Trump said that because of his administration "big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country" and "auto companies are pouring into the U.S." According to industry figures, neither statement is true.
Also Trump has claimed that tariffs are making America billions of dollars. That is not true. Trump's tariffs are hurting farmers and costing consumers.
Trump said the tax cut he pushed through Congress with only Republican support was "the biggest in American history." The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that is false.
Trump said he achieved an "economic turnaround of historic proportions." Economists agree that is not true; the economy turned around under Obama.
According to Trump, separating children from their parents at the border is established U.S. policy, most recently authorized on a wide scale by Obama. That is not true. The Obama administration separated some children from parents to prevent human trafficking, not as a wide-scale tool to try to prevent illegal immigration as Trump tried and failed. Reunification generally was quick, not, like Trump's policy, lasting for months or irrevocable.
You may still be an enthusiastic Trump supporter, but the truth is that telling the truth is not one of the man's virtues. Where do we go to get back national respect for honesty?

Texto completo: When Bill Cunningham died, in 2016, at 87, an era in New York fashion died with him. By day he would prowl the streets of the city on his bicycle photographing anonymous strangers whose style caught his eye. These he would print in his popular New York Times column On the Street. By night he would attend fancy fetes and snap photos of high-society nabobs in their finery for his feature Evening Hours. 
Richard Press's documentary “Bill Cunningham New York" (2010) turns the camera on Cunningham, following him for two years as he pursued his high-profile vocation and would return home from chi-chi parties to a monk-like tiny studio atop Carnegie Hall. He delves into Cunningham's life from his origins in a strict Boston Irish-Catholic family to his role as a revered mediator between the hoi polloi and the upper crust, between haute couture and the fashion that springs from the genius of ordinary people. 
“Bill Cunningham New York" can be seen on Filmatique as part of its The Creation of Meaning series.

Father away
How broken is the US immigration system? Local filmmaker David Sutherland (“Kind-Hearted Woman," 2013) details the plight of a family victimized by it in his wrenching and inspiring documentary “Marcos Doesn't Live Here Anymore."
Elizabeth Perez is a former US Marine decorated for her service in Afghanistan. She fell in love with an undocumented immigrant, Marcos Perez, and married him. They had four children, worked hard to support them, and were well liked and respected in their Cleveland community. Then in 2010 the police picked up Marcos in a traffic stop while he was driving to work. He was deported to Mexico, where he remains to this day.
But his wife is a fighter. For years she filed lawsuits and chased down politicians to have her husband restored to his family (her confrontation with US Representative Jim Jordan is especially galling). Finally she decided to move with her children to Mexico so they could live with their father — despite the challenges of learning a new language, adapting to a different culture, finding employment, and losing their health insurance. Not to mention leaving the country she loved and served with distinction.
For years, Sutherland had access to members of the Marcos family on both sides of the border as they struggled against bureaucracy and a systemic xenophobia and racism. The resulting film is a non-polemical portrait of a family responding to injustice with courage, persistence, and an abiding faith in the values that make our country great. 
“Marcos Doesn't Live Here Anymore" is available on DVD ($24.99) from PBS Distribution on June 25 and on digital download.

Ceci n'est pas un film
In 2010 an Iranian court found the world-renowned filmmaker Jafar Panahi (“The White Balloon," 1995; “Crimson Gold," 2003) guilty of political outspokenness, or, as the charges described it, “assembly and colluding with the intention to commit crimes against the country's national security and making propaganda against the Islamic Republic." He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment (later reduced to house arrest) and a 20-year ban on making movies. Since then he has covertly made and released to the outside world four features, one fewer than his total output prior to his conviction. 
The first of these, the coyly titled documentary “This Is Not a Film" (2011), he smuggled out of the country to the Cannes Film Festival on a USB drive hidden in a birthday cake. It is a film about a filmmaker who is not allowed to make a film made by a filmmaker not allowed to make a film. Set in Panahi's apartment, it features him talking on the phone, talking to his pet iguana, and talking with himself. He describes and acts out a script he has written about a girl who is locked up by her parents (it sounds a little like his 2018 film, “3 Faces"). He films the janitor with his phone as he picks up trash and tells him the story of his life. It comes as a relief when he steps onto his balcony and the fireworks celebrating the Iranian New Year burst in the sky. 
Evocative of both Beckett and Kafka, “This Is Not a Film" is a bleak celebration of the persistence and power of cinema.
“This Is Not a Film" can be seen on Filmatique starting on June 27 as part of its The Creation of Meaning series.

Diamonds are forever
As a catcher playing in the 1920s and '30s for the Washington Senators and other teams (including the Red Sox), Moe Berg put his Princeton education to good use by translating into Sanskrit the signs he flashed from behind the plate. It was one of 10 languages he had mastered. Though not a strong hitter (his 15-year career batting average was .243) he shone defensively and had a knack for calling pitches. These skills earned him a spot alongside such future Hall of Famers as Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, and Lou Gehrig on the All Americans Baseball Team that made a goodwill visit to Japan in 1934.
As Aviva Kempner (“The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg," 1998) shows in “The Spy Behind Home Plate," her fascinating documentary about this largely unheralded Jewish hero, that's when Berg's second career began.
Aware of the rising tensions between Japan and the United States that would culminate in the attack on Pearl Harbor, Berg secretly filmed a panorama of Tokyo. He shared this with the government back home, and in 1942 it would later prove useful for the Doolittle bombing raid. Proving himself to be a valuable asset, he would work intermittently throughout the war with the Office of Strategic Services, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Sometimes his espionage work verged on the exploits of James Bond. Berg met and befriended Bond's creator, Ian Fleming, himself a British secret agent. A particularly dicey assignment occurred in 1944, when Berg was instructed to attend a lecture given by Werner Heisenberg in Zurich, and determine how close the German physicist was to developing an atomic bomb for the Nazis. If necessary, Berg was to assassinate him. Luckily for Heisenberg, Berg concluded that he had abandoned the project.
Rich with anecdotes, entertaining interviews, rare archival footage, and even a recording of Berg acing the questions on the radio quiz show “Information Please," Kempner's film probes the secret life of a beguiling, enigmatic figure who probably had more secrets that we'll never know.
“The Spy Behind Home Plate" opens on June 28 at the Kendall Square Cinema.

Texto completo: In June of 1969, Charles W. Leslie and his partner, Fritz Lohman, were basking in the success of their first homoerotic art show, which they had put together the month before in their SoHo loft, when they got a phone call from a friend.
He asked if they could immediately join a protest at the Stonewall Inn. It was 2 a.m.
"He said he couldn't talk but needed as many bodies as possible, so we got dressed," Mr. Leslie recalled. "When we got there it looked like the end of the world. It was a horrible scene with people screaming and fighting. But that was only the beginning. That one night was not the end. There were other demonstrations."
It was quite the season for gay rights. Mr. Leslie and Mr. Lohman, who had 500 people attend their first exhibition (they had predicted 100, max), decided to curate more shows. Each one became more popular than the next. "We realized it didn't have to be all erotic," Mr. Leslie said. "People came with wonderful political art, romantic art and sociological art."
In 2016, the gallery and foundation, which had moved on from the couple's loft years before, officially became the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art. The museum, at 26 Wooster Street, has amassed over 30,000 objects, and is the host to six major exhibitions a year. Its current show, "Art After Stonewall 1969-1989," runs through July 21.
Mr. Lohman died in 2009, but Mr. Leslie has stayed committed to the museum. Last month, Mr. Leslie spoke about his work as a curator, and what has changed culturally over the past 50 years.
The following interview is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.
Q. How has gay life in New York changed since Stonewall?
A. Before Stonewall if you went to a gay bar they had dancing in the basement. A red light would flash on and off if someone suspicious came in. You had to stop dancing and pretend you were there with a buddy having a beer. Places were being raided, people were being taken off to jail for socializing with each other. After Stonewall, when the city finally realized they had to do something, the changes were absolute. It didn't happen all at once, it took some time. Sophisticated straight New Yorkers began to come together saying this law needed to be changed, it was undemocratic. There was a movement of sex positivity and sexual freedom, and an acceptance of premarital sex.
Did the pride parade play a part?
The parade was monumental in that it began something; it was like a juggernaut. The moment people were willing to come out in public became crucial. That was in 1970. Once it started, it couldn't stop.
When you started showing art in your home, was it hard to find artists?
Not at all. Many gay artists who worked in homosexual contexts had been denied venues all their lives. It didn't matter how brilliant the work was, if they showed it to a museum director or gallerist, it was shunned. Artists flooded in; not all of it was good, but it was all wonderful.
Which pieces have earned you the most notoriety?
Marion Pinto did a dual nude portrait of Fritz (my partner) and myself, and included us in her successful show, "Man as a Sex Object." We exhibited Keith Haring, David Hockney and Robert Mapplethorpe.
In 50 years of being a gallerist committed to gay and lesbian art, what are you most surprised by?
That it took 50 years to become a museum. There was so much stacked against us in the beginning. We couldn't get any attention for decades. We had wonderful artists and wonderful shows, but we couldn't get anyone to look at them. Finally The New York Times writer Holland Cotter came to a show in 2007. At the end of his piece he said: "This new space is a pearl beyond price." That put us on the map.
What did each decade represent to you?
The '60s was the barest beginning. You had gay art and straight kids taking off the shackles of the Eisenhower years. The '70s was like a flower opening up. There was hedonism. Everything got surprisingly gay: art, music, dance, theater. The '80s was a terrible shrinkage because the plague got everyone. The '90s was about recovery. We discovered artists didn't go into hiding; there were still a few private venues that showed work. We reestablished ourselves. During the new century things were sort of back to normal. This new decade has brought a new audience of people who weren't even born when the AIDS crisis was here.
Your first gallery on Wooster Street closed in 1982. Why?
AIDS stopped everything. Everything closed in New York: the baths, bars, social clubs. People were afraid to go into public venues. They stopped coming to the shows. Your friends were dying; we were at memorials, at bedsides, two men died in our home. It was a horrible decade.
What happened to the art scene then?
It shrunk. Gay art became more AIDS-focused. They documented it because mainstream art didn't. People are disturbed by images if it doesn't suit their psychology. A still image is very powerful, sometimes in a negative way.
Throughout the AIDS crisis, you salvaged queer art from destruction.
Art is worth rescuing. When people died from AIDS, their families threw out these amazing things, so we started tracking collections. We'd call people and inform them if they found art they didn't want because of a homoerotic element we'd make them an offer, or take a tax deduction, and that resulted in some gifts. Over 10 years we saved 50 to 80 items. We would go anywhere in the east; Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, to save whatever we could.
What's one of the most memorable items you salvaged?
Gustav Von Will did these enormous paintings on the walls of the old piers at night. When they tore down the pier we hired a company to cut them out. It was illegal, but we did it anyway.
What are you most proud of for this current show?
That we've resurrected some of the early work by artists who first attracted people, like Marion Pinto, Delmas Howe, Sandra DeSando, John Burton Harter, Michela Griffo and Arthur Tress, because we were not allowed to show anything that was out of the mainstream.
What was your vision regarding the importance of gay work?
I had no vision at all. I'm a compulsive doer. It had to do with some vague concept of gay liberation. When people are confronted with imagery, it finally helps them overcome biases and prejudices.

Jagger appears healthy as Rolling Stones rock
CHICAGO | An energetic Mick Jagger skipped, spun, sprinted and pranced Friday night as the Rolling Stones launched their North American tour at Chicago’s Soldier Field.
The 75-year-old showed no sign of ill health three months after the tour was postponed because a doctor said he required medical treatment.
The band stuck almost entirely to playing old classics, the set including “Let’s Spend the Night Together,” ‘’Gimme Shelter,” ‘’Brown Sugar,” ‘’Sympathy for the Devil” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.”
All the Stones are now in their 70s. The coast-to-coast tour will include stops in Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, Washington, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. Tom Petty estate, Soundgarden suing record label NEW YORK | Soundgarden and estates representing Tupac Shakur and Tom Petty are among those suing Universal Music Group for materials lost in a 2008 fire.
In a suit filed this week in federal district court in Los Angeles, the artists allege that Universal failed to protect music ruined in the fire and to inform them of the full extent of the fire’s impact, recently revealed by The New York Times.
Besides music by Petty and Shakur, the fire is believed to have destroyed master tapes and other recordings by Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Berry, among others.
Elton John gets top French award,
PARIS | Elton John, a newly awarded Legion of honor pinned to his suit, joined a call Friday by French President Emmanuel Macron to fund AIDS research and treatment.
The world-acclaimed singer spoke alongside Macron before thousands of people packed into the presidential Elysee Palace courtyard for an event of the annual Fete de la Musique.
John was clearly moved at receiving France’s highest award, pinned on him by Macron in a private ceremony, attended by the singer’s husband David Furnish and their two children.
Cardi B hit with new felony charges in strip club brawl NEW YORK | Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B was charged Friday with new felony charges in a fight last year at a New York City strip club.
An indictment filed in state court charges Cardi B with two counts of felony attempted assault and various lesser charges, including harassment and reckless endangerment. Prosecutors said she’s to appear Tuesday at an arraignment in Queens.
The 26-year-old Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, and her entourage argued with a bartender at Angels Strip Club, police have said. They say a fight broke out in which chairs, bottles and hookah pipes were thrown, causing minor injuries to the woman and another employee.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he would delay nationwide raids aiming to round up undocumented immigrants and deport them, saying that he would give Congress two weeks to sort out a deal on immigration.
"At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border," he wrote on Twitter. "If not, Deportations start!"
The raids were reported to begin in 10 major U. S. cities on Sunday, according to multiple news outlets, including the Washington Post and the New York Times.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement hours before Trump's announcement, asking that he delay the raids.
"Tomorrow is Sunday, and as many people of faith attend religious services, the President has ordered heartless raids," said Pelosi, D-Calif. "It is my hope that before Sunday, leaders of the faith-based community and other organizations that respect the dignity and worth of people will call upon the President to stop this brutal action which will tear families apart and inject terror into our communities. "
The raids were reportedly planned in cities including, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York and San Francisco, according to CNN.

Earlier this week, Trump announced that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would begin a massive deportation effort that he said would remove "millions" of undocumented immigrants from the U. S. The threat was made less than 24 hours before he officially kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign in Florida.
“Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States,” Trump posted on Twitter on Monday. “They will be removed as fast as they come in. ”
The president provided few details of the plan and White House officials declined to provide specifics earlier this week. Instead, the administration referred USA TODAY to Trump's tweet and to a June 4 briefing by Mark Morgan, acting director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. Morgan signaled then that the agency would increase deportations of families who had received deportation orders.
“We will be going after individuals who have gone through due process, who have received final orders of deportation," he said. "That will include families. Right now we’re talking about that and what it should look like. ”
The president has previously vowed to remove undocumented immigrants who had been ordered removed from the country by an immigration judge. It happened just days into his presidency. On Jan. 25, 2017, Trump signed an executive order instructing ICE agents to prioritize the nearly 1 million undocumented immigrants who have such orders of removal.
But removing "millions" of undocumented immigrants, like the president asserted, would involve clearing budget and logistical hurdles, experts said.
ICE agents have been following orders, arresting undocumented immigrants who were showing up for their regular, annual check-ins at ICE offices. But the administration has struggled to deport all of those undocumented immigrants because of historic backlogs in immigration court and the administration’s decision to deploy ICE agents to the southern border to respond to the growing number of Central American asylum-seekers.
ICE also faces budget constraints from Congress that limits how many people it can deport to about 400,000 a year. Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute, said the threat to deport “millions” of undocumented immigrants was "wildly unrealistic" and logisitcally, not possible.

Texto completo: This weekend I've been asked to speak at the annual gathering of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists.
I'll be speaking about leadership along with some of my heroes and leaders in journalism, including Dave Lieber of the Dallas Morning News and David Cay Johnston of Rochester.
While I was not trained as a journalist, I think about how I've been changed by the columnists I've loved — from Anna Quindlen in the New York Times and Tom Shales and Tony Kornheiser in The Washington Post to my personal inspiration, Erma Bombeck. These writers have provided vital insight and perspective while making a difference not only with their words on the page but their presence in the world.
"A good, credible writer can write convincingly from both sides of any issue and delights when reading others who can do the same," says Chris Carosa, who leads the National Society of Newspaper Columnists and happens to live in Rochester. He sees great columnists as empowering thought and perspective.
As I think about the takeaways I'll share about how to take leadership off the page and into the world, I can't help but think back to a year ago, on June 28, when I heard the news that a gunman had walked into the newsroom of the Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, and started shooting.
Wendi Winters, whose job was to write about the community she loved, saw what was happening and — instead of running away — picked up a trash can and ran toward the gunman. With an act of heroic courage, she saved many people.
Wendi was the best friend of my dear friend Paul. I'd heard about Wendi for years but had never met her. As the shooting was being reported in real time, Paul posted on Facebook that he hadn't heard from his friend.
I instantly felt a sense of dread, which was later confirmed when Paul's anguish splashed across my feed.
As the news unfolded, I learned the names of all the victims. Gerald Fishman, Rob Hiassen, John McNamara, Rebecca Smit — and Wendi Winters.
Wendi was a single mother of four children. She moved to Annapolis and started writing as a freelance writer, including a column called "Teen of the Week." She later joined the newsroom full time. She wrote about the nonprofit community, fashion, home decorating — what we'd call "light" news. But "light" has more than one meaning, and the term fit her, because I've been told her whole personality exuded light.
She also gave back to her community. Those kids she wrote about? She stayed in touch with many of them years after they had graduated and moved away. Each year she organized a "PR Bazaar" to help nonprofits in the community connect to the media.
Her children are ensuring that her writing legacy continues. They recently organized the PR Bazaar this year and a blood drive in her honor — all things she would have continued doing if she was still here with us. And her colleagues continue to honor her and her fallen colleagues, as the Capital Gazette received a special Pulitzer Prize this year for their reporting of the tragedy.
Columnists may not think of themselves as leaders, and I'm certain that Wendi wouldn't have used that word about herself. Yet in the end, a columnist's words and presence in the community — whether local, national or global — are about making a difference and inspiring others to do the same.
That's what columnists strive to do. And some people, like Wendi, did it in more ways than one.

REVIEW --- Weekend Confidential: Reihan Salam --- A young conservative's big new role

Texto completo: Reihan Salam has made a name for himself as an iconoclastic conservative thinker. More than a decade ago, he and Ross Douthat (now a columnist for the New York Times) made a splash with a coauthored book titled "Grand New Party," which argued that the GOP needed an activist policy agenda to win back working-class voters. Last year, in a book on the immigration problem, Mr. Salam called for amnesty, assimilation and a shift toward admitting higher-skill newcomers.
He is a 39-year-old Muslim whose parents emigrated from Bangladesh. He shaves his head and lives in the progressive enclave of Park Slope in Brooklyn. And he is, to the surprise of those expecting a more conventional choice, the new president of the Manhattan Institute, the influential conservative think tank whose ambitions long ago spilled beyond the confines of New York City.
Mr. Salam takes on his new role in the conservative intellectual establishment at a time of unusual ferment. The advent of Donald Trump has upended much that once seemed immutable in American conservatism. Old ideological alliances are fraying.
So will he steer the Manhattan Institute in a sharply different direction? What is his vision for the future of American conservatism? Is his idol the communitarian Edmund Burke or the individualist John Locke? Is he a nationalist or a cosmopolitan? Trump or never-Trump? Mr. Salam isn't taking the bait.
"I'm a coalition builder," he says earnestly over a long, animated lunch in midtown Manhattan. He argues that the institute, like conservatism itself, should be a big, open tent. "Conservatism is always refreshed by refugees from other political traditions," he says.
"When you're a columnist, your job is picking fights," he says of his previous work. "When you're the leader of an institution, you have to build consensus and solve practical problems."
Think tanks have long played an outsize role in developing America's right-leaning intellectual infrastructure, and since its founding in 1977, the Manhattan Institute has carved out an unusual niche: It examines urban problems and policies through the kind of market-oriented perspectives that can be scarce in big-city American politics.
"Most of our major urban centers have become political monocultures," Mr. Salam says, "where a small number of voters -- in many cases, a small number of primary voters -- are driving rigidly ideological agendas that threaten to undermine public safety and private-sector job growth."
Though the Manhattan Institute has worked on urban problems with a range of public officials over the years, it had a particularly close working relationship with Rudy Giuliani, New York City's mayor from 1994 through 2001. Mr. Giuliani was particularly receptive to the think tank's arguments for school choice, lower taxes, less regulation and a diminished role for public-employee unions.
Will those remain causes for the institute? "The policies you mention will continue to be high priorities, but we won't succeed unless we win over people" who don't already share our values and beliefs, Mr. Salam adds later by email. "In some cases, our scholars will make clear, principled arguments that have little shot of being embraced in the moment but that can set the stage for future policy victories; in others, they will try to identify compromises and pragmatic accommodations."
Additional priorities, he says, include a strong economy and a healthy culture. "I am deeply concerned about what I call punitive multiculturalism -- a cultural politics that revolves around the demonization of putatively privileged groups. We want to foster a policy conversation focused on developing the potential of all Americans, regardless of color or class."
In a sense, Mr. Salam grew up in his think tank's New York. The Manhattan Institute played an important role, for example, in advocating the influential "broken windows" theory of policing, which emphasizes public order and was put into effect in the city during Mr. Salam's teenage years. He was raised in Brooklyn's Borough Park, a neighborhood long home to many Orthodox Jews, and he remembers his parents sometimes working two jobs each, even as they studied -- his father for the CPA exam and his mother for a master's degree that helped her to become a renal dietitian.
Mr. Salam followed his sisters into the city's elite public Stuyvesant High School (lately the subject of controversy because few black and Latino students do well enough on the standardized entrance exam to get in) and went on to Harvard for his undergraduate degree. His upbringing took place largely among working-class Brooklynites. There were few nearby Bangladeshi immigrants, and his friends came from across New York's complex ethnic mix. He fondly recalls an Italian-American grandmother in his building who lavished love and lasagna on him when he was boy.
Mr. Salam's memories of the period around 1990 also include the city's crack epidemic and the climate of hostility surrounding an African-American boycott of two Korean-American stores over discrimination charges. In Mr. Salam's liberal family, he says, Mr. Giuliani's election as mayor in 1993 was seen as "some sort of calamity," yet he believes there is no denying that the city subsequently improved. These experiences, Mr. Salam says, helped to make him a conservative who embraces diversity while eschewing identity politics.
In keeping with this ideological ecumenism, he has written for a range of publications over the years, including Slate, the Atlantic and National Review, where he worked as executive editor. He says that he has always loved finding and cultivating talented people, something that he is now in a position to do at the Manhattan Institute.
Mr. Salam describes himself as a not particularly observant Muslim. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife (a magazine editor) and their 6-month-old daughter.
His hope, he says, is that his growth-oriented vision of urban conservatism will "draw in a new generation of people who feel frustrated by the debate we have now." As his own family's trajectory shows, newcomers to the U.S. have always arrived and forged their identities in places like New York. "A conservatism that does not speak to the cities," he says, "is going to be marginalized."

REVIEW --- Stonewall Wasn't the Start Of the Gay Rights Struggle --- In the mid-1960s, activist Frank Kameny led a campaign for equality that was rooted in American ideals.

Texto completo: Next weekend marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, when thousands of people poured into the streets of Greenwich Village in New York City to protest a police raid on a gay bar. State harassment of gay people had been commonplace for decades, but that night, the patrons at the Stonewall Inn had had enough -- and finally decided to fight back.
Stonewall has long been credited as the event that sparked the modern gay rights movement. But while the riots that ensued over three days and nights in late June 1969 were undoubtedly transformative, they weren't the first time that gay people had resisted persecution. Stonewall was preceded by well over a decade of gay civil rights activism, much of it led by a man named Frank Kameny. The rhetoric and strategies that he employed were less confrontational than those adopted by the people at Stonewall, but they set the intellectual template for the gay movement's eventual success.
Four years before Stonewall, on April 17, 1965, a group of 10 people formed a picket line outside the White House. It was the first of several protests meant to draw attention to the federal government's discrimination against gay people, thousands of whom had lost their jobs on the grounds that they represented security risks. Responding to a New York Times report the previous day that Cuba was herding gay people into forced labor camps, the picketers drew an explicit link between anti-gay oppression in the communist country and in the U.S. "Cuba's Government Persecutes Homosexuals. U.S. Government Beat Them To It," read one placard.
The pickets were organized by the Mattachine Society of Washington, D.C., one of the earliest gay rights organizations in the U.S., whose name playfully invoked the masked jesters in a Renaissance court. To align themselves with the prevailing anticommunism of the day was shrewd, since the association of homosexuality with subversion had been a leading justification for purging gay people from sensitive government positions.
The "Lavender Scare" of the 1950s and '60s attracted less notice than the concurrent Red one, in large part due to the fact that none of its targets had been willing to fight back. There was no gay equivalent of the Hollywood Ten, no high-stakes gay version of the Army-McCarthy congressional hearings to enrapture the nation. People who were fired due to their sexual orientation were nameless and faceless, appearing only as statistics in occasional newspaper items detailing the latest cull of "sexual deviants" from government ranks.
That is, until Frank Kameny came along. He was an eloquent World War II veteran, a Harvard Ph.D. astronomer and a former employee of the Army Map Service who had been fired in 1957 because of his sexual orientation. Now, when Americans were told about the supposed homosexual menace, they would have to reconcile those hair-raising accounts with the reality of this impressive patriot.
As co-founder of Mattachine's Washington, D.C. chapter, Kameny was unafraid to put himself forward as an advocate for a nascent gay community. "Most of our members hide behind phoney names and stay so deep in the closet they are a pitiful joke to those who know them," one of Kameny's Mattachine colleagues once wrote. Simply by acknowledging himself publicly as gay, "A man like Frank is the most valuable single item the homophile movement possesses."
Kameny could claim many firsts. He was the first federal employee to challenge his dismissal on the grounds of sexual orientation, the first openly gay person to testify in front of (and run for) Congress and the first individual to petition the Supreme Court on the grounds of anti-gay discrimination.
Kameny was unabashedly patriotic, and he rooted the case for gay equality in the country's founding documents, constantly citing them in lectures, interviews and a steady stream of letters to bureaucrats, congressmen and presidents. In a 1961 statement of purpose, Mattachine committed itself "to secure for homosexuals the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as proclaimed for all men by the Declaration of Independence . . . and the basic rights and liberties established by the word and spirit of the Constitution of the United States."
Knowing what would erupt just four years later in New York, it is quaint to read Kameny describing his solemn pickets in the nation's capital as a "militant" escalation from Mattachine's earlier letter-writing and public education campaigns. Protests outside government buildings, he wrote, were "an avenue of last resort, to be adopted only when it is clear that all doors are closed to us and are likely to remain so."
After police unleashed horrific violence against peaceful African-American civil rights demonstrators in Selma, Ala., Kameny wrote with foreboding about what might erupt should government oppression of the country's gay minority persist. "The prediction can be ventured that continued official intransigence" toward the reasonable concerns of gay people "will result ultimately in popular demonstrations by the homosexual community at large, which will be far less responsible, controlled and orderly," he wrote for Eastern Mattachine magazine in 1965. "This way lies the Washington equivalent of Birmingham!"
Kameny was prescient, although the violence he dreaded would explode not in the nation's capital but in New York. In the years after Stonewall, "militant" would take on fresh meaning, as a rising generation of gay activists abjured the reformist techniques pioneered by Kameny in favor of confrontation with authority.
Still, whether consciously or not, the participants in the Stonewall uprising drew from the example set by Kameny. There is a clear line connecting the unprecedented refusal of a young Army astronomer to accept being fired by the government because of his sexual orientation to the angry declaration by patrons of a mob-controlled gay bar, more than a decade later, that they would no longer tolerate police harassment. What the two episodes share is the principle that has been at the core of the gay cause: an insistence on one's own fundamental dignity.
In the half century since Stonewall, it has been the personal, family and social experience of gay people "coming out" -- and not some brilliant political strategy, abstruse legal wizardry or the economic power of the "pink dollar" -- that has proven to be the gay movement's most effective asset. The more familiar Americans become with gay people, the less likely they are to support discrimination against them.
"You know, the guys there were so beautiful," an emotional Allen Ginsberg, touring the shambolic scene around Sheridan Square, told a Village Voice reporter the final night of the Stonewall riots. "They've lost that wounded look." They had emulated the personal courage of Frank Kameny.

Texto completo: Looking for great book events to get your brain going?
We've got you covered with some great upcoming events, including a tribute to the late Kevin Killian; two chances to catch the "Prince of Preschool Books" Herve Tullet; a book signing with Bobby Hundreds; the inaugural L.A. Times Book Club event featuring the author Susan Orlean; and, last but not least, a Gen X-themed reading. Here are the best things to do over the next few days in literary L.A.:
--

Paying tribute to an S.F. great
Poet, novelist, editor, playwright and true cult icon Kevin Killian died June 15; to mourn his loss, the Poetic Research Bureau will host an informal reading Sunday in his honor. Books by the celebrated figure of San Francisco's New Narrative Movement include "Shy," "Bedrooms Have Windows" and "Impossible Princess," for which he won the Lambda Literary Foundation award for best gay men's erotica. Obituaries in Lambda, Art Forum and Frieze have underscored his significance in both the queer cannon and the hearts of the literary community at large, and hundreds of tweets and Facebook posts grieved his death and celebrated his joie de vivre. The Poetic Research Bureau will have copies of his work from which to read and encourages mourners to share their memories of the writer.
3 p.m. Sunday at the Poetic Research Bureau, 951 Chung King Road, L.A.. Free.
--
Double up on family time
Angelenos have two chances to catch the wildly popular children's book author and illustrator Herve Tullet this week, courtesy of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (ICA LA). (Just how popular is Tullet? His picture book "Press Here" spent over 200 non-consecutive weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List.) Join Tullet for a reading and book signing on Friday with Artbook @ Hauser & Wirth Bookstore, or jump into his interactive educators workshop on Tuesday at the ICA LA. The workshop "will demonstrate how to facilitate art-making at home, at school, or anywhere through [his] ingenious new project 'Ideal Exhibition,' " which will be showcased as part of "Summer School," the museum's new, hands-on education initiative. Events are family-friendly and free. They're also likely to be popular, so RSVP.
3 p.m. Saturday at Artbook at Hauser & Wirth, 917 E. 3rd St., L.A. Free.
3 p.m. Tuesday at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, 1717 E. 7th St., Los Angeles. Free.

Bobby Hundreds talks 'T-Shirt'
Bobby Kim, a.k.a. Bobby Hundreds, is a multifaceted guy. Co-founder of the L.A.-based streetwear company and media platform the Hundreds, he's also the mastermind behind Death Sentences Reading Club and recently published his own nonfiction debut, "This Is Not a T-Shirt: A Brand, a Culture, a Community -- a Life in Streetwear," which The Times' Adam Tschorn calls "an L.A.-centric roller-coaster ride." Hundreds will discuss "This Is Not a T-Shirt" with rapper Wale at the Barnes & Noble at the Grove on Tuesday. Expect crisp sneakers, graphic hoodies and a packed house.
7 p.m. Tuesday at Barnes & Noble in the Grove at Farmers Market, 189 the Grove Drive Suite K 30, Los Angeles. Barnes & Noble will issue wristbands for entry on a first-come, first-served basis to customers who buy the book.
--
Orlean ushers in a Times debut
The Los Angeles Times Book Club makes its debut on Tuesday evening with bestselling author Susan Orlean at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Barnsdall Art Park. Orlean will discuss "The Library Book," a gripping whodunit about the mysterious 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Central library (and a moving meditation on the necessity of books) with The Times' Deputy Managing Editor Julia Turner. If you love the L.A. Times Festival of Books, then you'll love this event, even if you're worried that you're "not a joiner." Book club editor Donna Wares said it best: Book clubs aren't just about books, they're "meaningful experiences and in-person discussions where stories and ideas can be shared with humanity and nuance the internet doesn't always allow." It's a great opportunity to connect with Orlean -- and other readers -- in real life.
6:30 p.m. Tuesday at Barnsdall Gallery Theatre, 4814 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles. $10-$75.

'90s nostalgia hits Venice
The Los Angeles Press promises a night of nostalgia with "Gen X Summer" on Thursday at Venice standby Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center. Poets and memoirists including Linda Ravenswood, Liz Stephens and Peggy Dobreer will share new work on an old theme, namely a particular fantasy of Los Angeles in the 1990s. The event description sounds like my seventh-grade mood board: "The Century City Mall, walking in Westwood ... Tower Records, Heaven, penny loafers, Fiorucci and Hamburger Hamlet," all serve as artistic inspiration for this event. An open mike will follow, so if you've got a sonnet stashed away about the Johnny Rockets on Melrose (what, just me?), here's your chance to shine.
8 p.m. Thursday at Beyond Baroque, 681 N. Venice Blvd., Venice. $10 regular admission, $6 students and seniors; free for members.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
LOVE ISLAND Stream on Hulu. This British reality show, which first aired in 2015, has grown into a cultural phenomenon. The premise is simple: A group of 20-something singles enters a villa in Majorca, where they couple up. Every few weeks, new singles enter the home and the couples can reshuffle, while the audience at home weighs in on who stays and who should go. With its rabid fan following, the show has inspired heated debates on the internet, in the media and even in the British House of Lords on mental health, broadcasting rules and emotional abuse. The first four seasons are available on Hulu, with episodes of Season 5 rolling out on Saturday.
POINT BREAK (1991) Stream on Hulu; Rent on YouTube, Vudu, Amazon, Google Play and iTunes. This '90s testosterone-fueled thriller, directed by Katheryn Bigelow, has it all: surfing bank robbers, skydiving, Gary Busey and the internet's latest crush, Keanu Reeves. Reeves plays Johnny Utah, an F.B.I. agent who embeds with a gang of surfers that may be involved in a string of robberies. Utah soon finds himself in a cat-and-mouse game with the group's leader, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, "Just as she did in 'Blue Steel,' the director Kathryn Bigelow observes the peculiar complicity that develops between a law officer and a seductive criminal."
THE OLD MAN & THE GUN (2018) Stream on HBO platforms; Rent on Amazon, YouTube and Google Play. Not all films about bank robbers are high-octane thrill rides. In "The Old Man & Gun," based on true events, Robert Redford plays Forrest Tucker, a career criminal who spent most of his life, into his late 70s, getting locked up for robbing banks and breaking out of prison. The film, directed by David Lowery, examines Tucker's mysterious motives as he moves into the final phase of his life. Along the way, Tucker connects with old compatriots, played by Danny Glover and Tom Waits, meets a love interest, played by Sissy Spacek, and evades the cops, led by the dogged detective John Hunt (Casey Affleck). Praising Mr. Redford's performance in his review, A.O. Scott wrote in The Times, "At a time when bluster, bragging and histrionic displays of self-pity are apparently the defining characteristics of American manhood, it's nice to be reminded of the virtues of discretion and quiet."
What's on TV
BIG3 BASKETBALL 8 p.m. on CBS and CBS Sports Network. The N.B.A. season may be over, but basketball fans can still catch games from the fledgling three-on-three league, Big3. Founded by the rapper Ice Cube and Jeff Kwatinetz, the league reunites former N.B.A. players like Greg Oden, Lamar Odom, Amar'e Stoudemire and Metta World Peace across its 12 traveling teams. Big3's third season kicks off in Detroit at Little Caesars Arena, with Trilogy taking on the 3-Headed Monsters, Power facing off against 3's Company and the Enemies playing Bivouac.

Texto completo: The New York Times made a wonderful piece of content asking 21 of the 2020 Democratic candidates 18 questions. Each one did a pretty good job on these questions, but I regret to say that no one got them exactly right, and that is probably a bad sign for the debates! Here are the right answers:
1. In an ideal world, would anyone own handguns?
You have set out to trick me! But I am too clever for your games! Yes, in an ideal world, there would be handguns aplenty, one for every hand. But naturally ownership would be a thing of the past! They would all be owned in common, through socialism!
2. Would your focus be improving the Affordable Care Act or replacing it with single payer?
My focus would be on INFRASTRUCTURE!
3. Do you think it's possible for the next president to stop climate change?
Yes, but only if the next president absorbs a lot of carbon. I think I am a greater carbon sink than my opponents, and you would have to put me in the middle of the ocean, but I am confident it can be done.
4. Do you think Israel meets international standards of human rights?
*glances around nervously* Uh, to whom am I speaking? Is this in an ideal world? Sorry, could you clarify? I mean, if we're in an ideal world, ah, well, you know I love international standards of human rights, as who would not? *starts to sweat* Also solutions and states, numbers of states. But then, Bibi Netanyahu is, well, once you realize the complications and take everything into account, and, uh, gripped him warmly by the hand, stared into his eyes and called him "brother," as in that ideal world we all surely would. I think that answers your question.
5. Who is your hero, and why?
My opponents will say that their heroes are their wives. All of them are wrong except for Jay Inslee. My hero is Jay Inslee's wife.
6. Would there be American troops in Afghanistan at the end of your first term?
I swear on my sacred honor, on the grave of my mother, on my hero wife, on the Congress, on my most treasured picture of John Jay, that there would not be. Unless something happens!
7. How many hours of sleep do you get a night?
The spirit of the American voter rises from the lamp to claim me, and I go I know not where. What I am trying to say is that I sleep the right amount, a normal amount.
8. Do you think illegal immigration is a major problem in the United States?
I spit upon you for using the term! You have said the word to entrap me into saying the word!
9. Where would you go on your first international trip as president?
SAUDI ARABIA, BABY! NO BAD REASON, DON'T FRET!
10. Describe the last time you were embarrassed. Why?
Recently I was riding out of a burning building with an elderly man held in my arms, and when I did a manual on my skateboard right as the building exploded behind us, I wobbled a little bit and my Hero Wife saw but she said ultimately that it was relatable.
11. Do you think President Trump has committed crimes in office?
I don't see how you could read all 912 pages of the Mueller report cover to cover (I printed it out in a big font to make it longer) and not come away with the inescapable conclusion that he did crimes.
12. Do you support or oppose the death penalty?
I, for myself, have always opposed it.
13. Should tech giants like Facebook, Amazon and Google be broken up? (Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, also owns The Post.)
I think that Google and Facebook should be dismantled, but Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, also owns The Post.
14. Are you open to expanding the size of the Supreme Court?
YOU HAD BETTER BELIEVE IT! I WANT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO BE FILLED WITH HELIUM UNTIL THEY BEGIN TO STRAIN AT THEIR ROBES AND FLOAT UNMOORED UPWARDS!
15. When did your family first arrive in the United States, and how?
On my father's side, we arrived yesterday in a manner of enormous difficulty that I enjoy recounting at every campaign stop. My father worked his way up from nothing, pulling himself up by bootstraps he knitted himself from rat fur in steerage. On my mother's side, we have been here since the Mayflower, and let me tell you, we were the oldest money on the Mayflower, and we have a cherished family story of a time King John apologized to us for no reason.
16. What is your favorite comfort food on the campaign trail?
The American voter, and Abraham Lincoln!
17. What do you do to relax?
A baked potato.
18. Does anyone deserve to have a billion dollars?
I think we have the right to a billion dollars, but in my ideal world nobody would have one in the home, where a child might find it and hurt himself.

NYT reporter just misses another moment of self-awareness regarding bad Biden press

Texto completo: Once again, the New York Times came close, but not quite there, to recognizing the real reason why former Vice President Joe Biden is fending off a sudden torrent of attacks from Democrats and their allies in the press.
In an article published Friday, the Times rightly notes that the 2020 Democratic primary front-runner is suffering a sudden onslaught of criticism aimed at his long record as a professional politician. The chief complaint against Biden right now is that he regaled an audience this week with an anecdote fondly recalling his working relationships with late segregationist Dixiecrats Sens. James Eastland and Herman Talmadge.
The Times report also notes correctly that the criticisms directed at Biden over these anecdotes seem odd, considering the former vice president has been using them for years to boast of his ability to find a civil middle ground with even unrepentant racists.
So what changed? This is where the Times misses its moment. The report, titled, “Biden Has Not Changed. The Politics, Culture and Mood of His Party Have,” somehow manages to blame it all on Trump:
[If] Mr. Biden remains the same character he was two and a half years ago, the political and cultural environment around him is utterly different. Democratic politics is now defined by a mood of emergency, and a give-no-quarter ethos on issues like racial justice and abortion rights where liberals view their fundamental values as under assault. [...] Stories that voters once heard as folksy tales of the last century’s Senate no longer sound so benign to an electorate convulsed by President Trump’s blunt appeals to racial animus. A majority of Americans believe race relations have worsened under Mr. Trump, and liberal constituencies appear far less receptive to the idea that even the worst racists can be negotiated with.
Uh, not quite.
The issues that Biden's 2020 competitors are highlighting now are not new. As noted in the Times article itself, he has been telling stories about working with famed segregationists for years. What has changed is that Democrats and their allies in the press have decided his transgressions are no longer worth ignoring or defending. Between 2015 and now, reporters are willing to aid and take opposition research from certain 2020 Democratic candidates in their quest to take down the front-runner. What changed is that there are younger and more exciting Democratic candidates running for the party’s nomination, and Biden is long past his expiration date — as Trump once put it, pulled by Obama off Washington's garbage heap.
The excuse that Biden’s dusty anecdotes are now problematic because of Trump is laughable on its face. First, it suggests that Trump is responsible for the intersectional sensibilities that seem now to be dogging Biden. If anything, things worked the other way around. Trump was elected in response to the intersectionality politics championed by liberals and Democratic lawmakers for at least five years now. That predated Trump by a long way and had already reached a boiling point in 2015 when Bernie Sanders was cowed on stage at his own rally by Black Lives Matter activists.
Second, it is absurd even to believe that intersectional silliness turned Biden's career from lovable to liability. The reason Biden's transgressions were never newsworthy, controversial, or even particularly interesting before was that Biden was the vice president of St. Obama. Recall that Republicans who too eagerly or uncautiously eulogized Sen. Strom Thurmond actually paid a price for it.
The reality is that this stuff about Biden, which has long been known and is no secret to anyone with access to a phone or a computer, was always newsworthy and controversial. But Democrats didn't want it discussed previously, and a biased press was happy enough to heed their wishes. They weren't going to pursue it when Obama was in the White House because, well, you draw your own conclusions.

Texto completo: Two Area Teens among 26 Bronfman Fellows
THE BRONFMAN FELLOWSHIP'S 33rd group of intellectually curious North American llth-graders includes two Philadelphia-area teens.
The 26 fellows chosen from more than 230 applicants will participate in a five-week program of study and travel in Israel, followed by a year of programming centered around pluralism, social responsibility and Jewish texts. They also will interact with Israeli peers chosen through a parallel selection process.
One of the local teens is Ross Armón, a member of Congregation Adath Jeshurun and a junior at Abington Senior High School. He is the sports editor of his school's newspaper, a setter on the varsity volleyball team, the founder of Abington High School's Jewish Student Union and a member of the Future Business Leaders of America club.
The other is Samantha Deutsch of Wyndmoor, who is a junior at Germantown Friends School and a member of Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel. At school, she leads the Jewish Affinity Club, is a student council grade representative and a member of the Model United Nations club. She is also a Penn Young Scholar and takes courses at the University of Pennsylvania.
RBG Exhibit Planned at NMAJH
The National Museum of American Jewish History announced that it will be the first East Coast venue for the "Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg" exhibit.
The exhibit is based on The New York Times book and created in partnership with its authors, Irin Carmon and Shana Knizhnik. It will take a look at the life of the Supreme Court justice and her roles as a student, life partner, mother, lawyer, judge, women's rights pioneer and pop culture icon.
The exhibition is narrated via Ginsburg's writings, opinions and interviews. There also will be an exploration of Notorious RBG memes, fan art and parody - from a cartoon action figure named Wrath Hover Ginsbot to renderings of Ginsburg's likeness on T-shirts, nail decals and tattoos.
"Justice Ginsburg's life and career are an essential reminder that the freedoms promised here in Philadelphia are the right of every person in the country," said Josh Perelman, the museum's chief curator and director of exhibitions and interpretation.
The exhibit will be on display from Oct. 4 through Jan. 12, 2020.

Local Rabbi Publishes Nonfiction Book
Rabbi Maurice Harris, the associate director for thriving communities and an Israel affairs specialist at Reconstructing Judaism in Wyncote, recently published the nonfiction book The Forgotten Sage: Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah and the Birth of Judaism as We Know It.
The book details the life and impact of Joshua ben Hananiah, a "poor and ugly nail-maker" who lived in the era after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.
"Through his humanity, humility and occasional audacity, Joshua helped set Judaism on its course towards becoming the decentralized, multi-opinionated, exile-surviving, other-religion-respecting, pragmatic-yet-altruistic, wounded-yet-hopeful religion that it is at its best," according to the press materials. *

Texto completo: Joy Harjo, a graduate of the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, on Wednesday became the first Native American designated as poet laureate of the United States.
The Poetry and Literature Center of the Library of Congress announced that the writer and musician has been named the 23rd person to hold the position, which was established in 1937.
As poet laureate, she will deliver a lecture and reading of her poetry at the Library of Congress and introduce poets in the library's annual poetry series, as well as promote the appreciation of the form.
The poet laureate receives a $35,000 stipend plus travel expenses, paid for by a private gift from Archer M. Huntington. The position also comes with an office in the ornate Jefferson Building in Washington, D.C., but few official duties.
She told the Washington Post that one of her first projects will involve using her new pulpit to humanize Native Americans for a country that still harbors many misconceptions about them.
In addition to being the first Native American to become the nation's poet laureate, Harjo, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, also is the first poet from Oklahoma to serve in the position.
"It's quite an honor, and I'm just at the very beginning," she told poets.org prior to the announcement. "I'm assessing how I can be most useful in this position and, of course, it's going to have a lot to do with Native Nations poets. ... It's also about of course American poetry and American voices, which is really how we sing the American story, which involves all of the voices."
Harjo, 68, steps into the role held for the past two years by Tracy K. Smith. Past poet laureates include W.S. Merwin, Robert Pinsky and Juan Felipe Herrera.
The poet laureate is chosen by the librarian of Congress in consultation with the current laureate, former appointees, poetry critics and staff in the Poetry and Literature Center.
Her term runs from October to May.
Poet Santee Frazier, the newly appointed director of the low-residency master of fine arts program in creative writing at the Institute of American Indian Arts, said Wednesday, "It's great to have Native issues in the spotlight and for her voice to bring attention to these things."
Frazier, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, said, "Through her poetry and advocacy, I can see people becoming more aware of and more interested in understanding Native contributions to American culture and to the issues of identity and sovereignty that we're struggling with constantly."
Harjo was born in 1951 in Tulsa, Okla., where she grew up on Native land, the eldest of four children.
While she did not grow up around many books, according to the New York Times, she did hear many stories, primarily about her ancestors, including tribal chiefs who were among her father's people.
She has said she came to poetry first through music. She told an interviewer that her mother wrote songs and sang, and she grew up "with a lot of country swing musicians in our house playing music."
She started writing as a college student in New Mexico in the early 1970s, during what she has described as "the beginning of a multicultural literary movement."
In addition to graduating from IAIA, where she also taught, Harjo studied painting at the University of New Mexico. She later earned a graduate degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, where she struggled with peers and professors who did not always understand or appreciate her aesthetic.
In 1979, she burst into the public consciousness with her first full-length volume of poetry, What Moon Drove Me to This? The author of eight books of poetry and a memoir, as well as essays and theatrical works, Harjo, a saxophonist, also has recorded four albums as a solo artist and with her band, the Arrow Dynamics.
Harjo is a professor of English and American Indian Studies at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.
She has received many awards for her work, including the 2019 Jackson Poetry Prize from Poets & Writers, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize from the Poetry Foundation, a Guggenheim Fellowship and a United States Artists Fellowship.
Harjo's latest book of poetry, An American Sunrise, will be released by W.W. Norton in August.
The poet laureate is not a political position. However, the Associated Press reported that she makes clear her disdain for many office seekers in her poem "For Those Who Would Govern."
She also has expressed her views on President Donald Trump, the wire service noted. In 2016, she linked to a Newsweek article about then-candidate Trump's overseas business connections and tweeted, "Donald Trump's foreign ties may conflict with U.S. national security interests." Last summer, she linked to a New York magazine article about Trump and Russia, and tweeted, "What if Trump Has Been a Russian asset Since 1987?"
This report includes material from the Associated Press, Washington Post and the New York Times.

Carl Hulse's latest examines how the highest court hit its lowest point

Texto completo: With the death of Antonin Scalia came the death of civility in the Senate.
Civility, to be sure, had been on life support for some time. It took a body blow when Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was caned in 1856 by Senator Preston Brooks of South Carolina. It barely survived the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Robert Bork (who was defeated) and Clarence Thomas (who today sits on the high court). 
But when Scalia died in the winter of 2016, the Republicans who controlled the Senate, and who deplored everything about Barack Obama, moved with lightning speed to assure that the 44th president would not have a chance to replace the revered conservative jurist.
The swiftness of that decision has been known for more than three years. But the maneuvering behind that decision provides some of the most riveting details of New York Times correspondent Carl Hulse's “Confirmation Bias,"' a gripping tale of insider Washington with implications far beyond the capital and far beyond our own time.
Here, in brief, is how the Republican offensive unfolded. Sen. Ted Cruz, reviled even by his Republican colleagues, was set to move to close down any Obama nomination. But GOP leaders agreed they could not let that happen. Any initiative begun by the snarling Texan would be tainted and eventually discredited. So Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell swept in, arguing that “this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President," dooming Merrick Garland's chances for confirmation before he was even nominated. 
The effect was to widen the partisan divide, to weaponize the confirmation process, to enrage Democrats and to alter the rhythms of conventional Washington practice. 
''It was an act of outrageous audacity," Hulse writes. “Virtually on his own, without consulting a single elected colleague, Mitch McConnell had decided to deny the Democratic president his right to fill an open Supreme Court seat." 
Even then, the name on the lips of those in the Donald Trump campaign inner circle was Brett Kavanaugh; they itched to retain that opening for him. The lawyer at the center of that circle was Donald McGahn, later to win notoriety for his refusal to appear before a House committee. 
Kavanaugh would end up being Trump's second nominee, but the drama had been set in motion. It didn't help the Democrats' cause that Joe Biden, unbidden and unrestrained, was on the record saying that if a Supreme Court vacancy occurred in the last year of George H.W. Bush's term, the president should not name a nominee “until after the November election is completed." 
At the heart of this dispute, and the many that followed, was a vital question of constitutional law and congressional convention: Should lawmakers weigh ideology when considering confirming judges, or is their role merely to assess a nominee's qualifications? Here views change with elections; those out of power lean toward ideology, those with a party colleague in the White House lean toward qualifications. And so judicial nominations have become bitter battlegrounds.
Much of what Hulse sets out is familiar to those following the news — the banning of filibusters for judicial nominees, once considered by Republicans but eventually embraced by Democrats, for example. When that gambit was later applied by Republicans to Supreme Court nominees, Democrats were enraged."
Hulse tells us that McGahn welcomed applying this change in Senate procedure, known as the “nuclear option," to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch because in that episode the ideological balance of the high court was not at issue; Gorsuch represented a conservative replacing a conservative on the court. Cynically but shrewdly, McGahn understood it was better to have the nuclear option in place for the next confirmation fight, when the court could be moved sharply to the right.
And it was. Enter Kavanaugh, a magnet for Democratic criticism even before the emergence of charges of youthful sexual harassment. The result was the most explosive Senate hearings since Anita Hill's accusations against Thomas.
Hulse gives us little new insight on Kavanaugh's private life and the accusations against him; that will have to await a book now in preparation by his New York Times colleagues Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, whose “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" is scheduled for publication in early October , the day after the court opens its fall session. But Hulse does provide us with an assessment of the impact of the Kavanaugh hearings, and it is a searing judgment.
“In the end, both sides believed that the warfare over the courts and Kavanaugh played to their immediate benefit — probably the worst possible outcome for the Senate, the Supreme Court, and the badly broken confirmation process," he writes. “The nation's governing institutions were left facing severe challenges to both their credibility and their ability to assure the public they were acting on behalf of all Americans."
Sadly, that assessment rings true. The ultimate victims of the wars over the courts may be the Americans of the future. They will look back on this book, and the episodes it chronicles, with wonder, and with disappointment and disdain.

Biden recalls segregationists' civility

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Joe Biden, defending himself Tuesday night against suggestions that he is too “old fashioned" for today's Democratic Party, invoked two Southern segregationist senators by name as he fondly recalled the “civility" of the Senate in the 1970s and 1980s.
Speaking at a fund-raiser at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City, Biden, 76, stressed the need to “be able to reach consensus under our system," and cast his decades in the Senate as a time of relative comity. His remarks come as some in his party say that Biden is too focused on overtures to the right as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination.
At the event, Biden noted that he served with the late Senators James O. Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia, both Democrats who were staunch opponents of desegregation. Eastland was the powerful chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Biden entered the chamber in 1973.
“I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland," Biden said, slipping briefly into a Southern accent, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser. “He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son.' "
He called Talmadge “one of the meanest guys I ever knew, you go down the list of all these guys."
“Well guess what?" Biden continued. “At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn't agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore."
On Wednesday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, one of two black candidates running for president, said Biden was “wrong" to use segregationists as examples for bringing the country together.
“You don't joke about calling black men 'boys,' " Booker said in a statement. “I'm disappointed that he hasn't issued an immediate apology for the pain his words are dredging up for many Americans. He should."
Another presidential candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, posted a photo of his multiracial family on Twitter and cited a racial epithet that Eastland used.
“It's 2019 & @JoeBiden is longing for the good old days of 'civility' typified by James Eastland," de Blasio wrote. “It's past time for apologies or evolution from @JoeBiden. He repeatedly demonstrates that he is out of step with the values of the modern Democratic Party."
Eastland, a plantation owner, was known as a vociferous opponent of integration efforts and a staunch critic of the civil rights movement, which he sometimes dismissed as the work of “communists." Throughout his career he referred to African-Americans as members of an “inferior race" and used the racist term “mongrelization."
Talmadge was also a critic of the civil rights movement and opposed the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, that declared racially segregated public schools unconstitutional.
Biden has long discussed his personal commitment to civil rights, and he has many strong relationships in the black community. On Wednesday evening, he pushed back aggressively against anyone calling on him to disavow his comments, according to the Washington Post.
"They know better," he said as he went to a fund-raiser. "Apologize for what? Cory should apologize. He knows better. There's not a racist bone in my body; I've been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period. Period. Period."
New York Times
Cash rolls in after Trump reelection launch
President Trump raised $24.8 million in less than 24 hours as he officially launched his reelection, GOP officials said Wednesday, underscoring the huge fund-raising lead the president has over a divided and crowded Democratic primary field.
The Wednesday announcement by Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, confirmed by campaign officials, indicates that the Trump campaign is on track to report its best fund-raising quarter since he became president.
The one-day haul as Trump held a kickoff rally in Orlando included $14 million for Trump's reelection committee and $10 million that went to Trump Victory, a joint fund-raising committee between his campaign and the RNC that can accept large donations.
The president is scheduled to headline a high-dollar fund-raising luncheon at the Trump National Doral hotel in Florida Wednesday that is set to bring in $5 million, officials said.
The president's fund-raising bonanza this week far eclipsed the $6.3 million that former vice president Joe Biden's campaign said it pulled in on the day of his late April campaign announcement — the largest 24-hour amount raised by any of the Democratic campaigns this year.
Washington Post
Plans readied for Fourth of July celebration in D.C.
President Trump's participation in the nation's annual Fourth of July celebration will include a Trump speech honoring America's armed forces, along with music, military demonstrations, and flyovers, the administration announced Wednesday, about two weeks before the patriotic holiday.
Federal lawmakers, local officials, and others have voiced concerns that Trump could alter the tone of what traditionally is a nonpartisan celebration of America's founding by delivering an overtly political speech after he added himself to an event that typically has not included the president.
After losing out on his wish for a military parade in Washington, Trump tweeted in February for people to "HOLD THE DATE!" for the "Salute to America" event, which he said would be held at the Lincoln Memorial and feature a major fireworks display, entertainment, "and an address by your favorite President, me!"

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The rising tensions between the United States and Iran continued on Thursday morning, when a U. S. surveillance drone was shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in what a U. S. official called an "unprovoked attack. "
U. S. and Iranian officials gave differing accounts of the attack, which comes as the war of words between the U. S. and Iran threatens to spill into open conflict.
Here's what we know so far about the drone attack and the tensions between the U. S. and Iran:
What the U. S. is saying
The key difference between the two sides is that U. S. officials said the drone was shot down in "international airspace" over the Strait of Hormuz.
In a briefing at the Pentagon on Thursday, Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U. S. Air Forces Central Command, called into the Pentagon from a base in Qatar:
"A U. S. Navy RQ-4 was flying over the Gulf of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz on a surveillance mission in international airspace in the vicinity of recent IRGC maritime attacks when it was shot down by an IRGC surface to air missile fired from a location in the vicinity of Goruk, Iran," Guastella said.
"This was an unprovoked attack on a U. S. surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission," he continued. "This attack is an attempt to disrupt our ability to monitor the area following recent threats to international shipping and free flow of commerce. "
Guastella reiterated that Iranian claims that the drone was shot down over Iranian airspace "categorically false. "
Trump discussed the issue during an Oval Office meeting later on Thursday, saying, "Iran made a big mistake. This drone was in international waters, clearly. We have it all documented scientifically not just words. And they made a very bad mistake. "
When asked about how the U. S. would respond, he said, "you'll find out. "
Trump added that he thought it was someone "loose and stupid who did it. "
What Iran is saying
Iran has alleged that the drone had violated Iranian airspace, saying the drone fell in the Kouh-e Mobarak region in the central district of Jask.
Iran and the U. S. : Escalating Iran crisis looks a lot like the path US took to Iraq war
Major General Hossein Salami, a spokesperson for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, said the incident serves as a warning to the U. S.
"The downing of the U. S. drone had an explicit, decisive and clear message that defenders of the Islamic Iran’s borders will show decisive and knockout reactions to aggression against this territory,” Salami said at a news conference in Kurdistan Province. “Borders are our redline, and any enemy violating these borders will not go back. "
Despite previous comments by top Trump administration advisors on the threat posed by Iran, President Donald Trump has contradicted his top advisors. In an interview with TIME posted this week, Trump said that the attacks were "very minor. "
Troop deployments
The U. S. has also deployed more troops to the Middle East in what Pentagon officials say is a direct response to Iran's provocations.
On Monday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced that 1,000 troops would be sent to the Middle East "to address air, naval, and ground-based threats in the Middle East. " Shanahan cited "hostile behavior by Iranian forces and their proxy groups that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region. "

Nuclear tensions
Iran announced this week that it would soon be breaking its nuclear stockpile and enrichment limits set under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the "Iran Deal. " The U. S. withdrew from that pact in 2015, but the U. S. has urged Iran to abide by its provisions.
In a television interview last Sunday on Fox News, Pompeo restated America's goals regarding Iran's nuclear program.
"President Trump has been unambiguous: Iran will not get a nuclear weapon," he said. "That's the goal, that’s the objective of our entire campaign with respect to Iran and to create stability throughout the Middle East as part of that effort. "
Does this look like the buildup to the Iraq War?
The saber-rattling between the U. S. and Iran appears to have parallels to the build-up to the 2003 Iraq War.
On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was trying to make the case to Congress that Iran had ties to Al Qaeda, which under a 2001 congressional authorization, would potentially give the Trump administration the legal authority to take military action against Iran.
Pompeo ducked a question about military authorization during a Fox News interview last Sunday, saying that “the president has the authorization to act to defend American interests," but did not elaborate on what authorization that was.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released in late May shows that half of all Americans believe the U. S. will go to war with Iran "within the next few years. "

Texto completo: First it was the "the failing New York Times." Then "fake news." Then "enemy of the people." President Trump's escalating attacks on the New York Times have paralleled his broader barrage on American media. He's gone from misrepresenting our business, to assaulting our integrity, to demonizing our journalists with a phrase that's been used by generations of demagogues.
Now the president has escalated his attacks even further, accusing the Times of a crime so grave it is punishable by death.
On Saturday, Mr. Trump said the Times had committed "a virtual act of treason." The charge, levied on Twitter, was in response to an article about American cyber incursions into the Russian electrical grid that his own aides had assured our reporters raised no national-security concerns.
Few paid much attention. Many news organizations, including the Times, determined the accusation wasn't even worth reporting, a sign of how inured we've grown to such rhetorical recklessness. But this new attack crosses a dangerous line in the president's campaign against a free and independent press.
Treason is the only crime explicitly defined in the U.S. Constitution. The Founding Fathers knew the word's history as a weapon wielded by tyrants to justify the persecution and execution of enemies. They made its definition immutable -- Article III reads: "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort" -- to ensure that it couldn't be abused by politicians for self-serving attacks on rivals or critics. The crime is almost never prosecuted, but Mr. Trump has used the word dozens of times.
There is no more serious charge a commander in chief can make against an independent news organization. Which presents a troubling question: What would it look like for Mr. Trump to escalate his attacks on the press further? Having already reached for the most incendiary language available, what is left but putting his threats into action?
There's evidence that's already happening. The administration has waged an aggressive legal campaign against journalists. Leak investigations, which were already on the rise under President Obama, have surged. Government regulatory powers have been misused to retaliate against news organizations, such as the attempt to block AT&T from acquiring CNN's parent company, Time Warner. Most recently, the precedent-shattering use of the Espionage Act against Julian Assange for publishing classified information has raised fears that the Justice Department seeks not merely to punish illegal hacking but effectively to criminalize standard reporting practices.
Meanwhile, the president's rhetorical attacks continue to foster a climate in which trust in journalists is eroding and violence against them is growing. More than a quarter of Americans -- and a plurality of Republicans -- now agree that "the news media is the enemy of the American people" and "the president should have the authority to close news outlets engaged in bad behavior." A world-wide surge of attacks has made this the most dangerous year for journalists on record. This is particularly true in parts of the world where pursuing the truth already carries great risks, as news reporters and editors experience rising levels of censorship, harassment, imprisonment and murder.
I met with the president in the Oval Office earlier this year and told him directly that authoritarian leaders around the world, with growing impunity, are employing his words to undermine free expression. The president expressed concern and insisted he wanted to be viewed as a defender of the free press. But in the same conversation, he took credit for the term "fake news," a phrase that has now been wielded by dozens of leaders across five continents to justify everything from the passage of anti-free-speech laws in Egypt to the takeover of independent news organizations in Hungary to a crackdown on investigations into genocide in Myanmar.
America's Founders believed that a free press was essential to democracy, and the American experience has proved them right. Journalism guards freedoms, binds together communities, ferrets out corruption and injustice, and ensures the flow of information that powers everything from elections to the economy. Freedom of the press has been fiercely defended by nearly all American presidents regardless of politics or party affiliation, and regardless of their own complaints about coverage.
There are moments when the press and the government are legitimately at odds, never more so than when the press's conviction about the public's right to know collides with the government's assessment of the importance of maintaining secrecy. Journalists take seriously the concern that their reporting may jeopardize national security, and at the Times we have withheld details or delayed publication when government officials convinced us there was a danger of loss of life or damage to intelligence operations.
The story that prompted the president's attack was no exception. As the Times prepared the story for publication, our reporter contacted officials at the White House National Security Council, the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command and gave them the opportunity to raise any national-security concerns about the story. They told us they did not have any. Shortly after publication, the president accused the Times of treason.
Over 167 years, through 33 presidential administrations, the Times has sought to serve America and its citizens by seeking the truth and helping people understand the world. There is nothing we take more seriously than doing this work fairly and accurately, even when we are under attack. Mr. Trump's campaign against journalists should concern every patriotic American. A free, fair and independent press is essential to our country's strength and vitality and to every freedom that makes it great.

Texto completo: MOSCOW - The Dutch-led investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014 named its first suspects on Wednesday - among them three Russian nationals close to Moscow's intelligence services.
Investigators have long suspected a missile from Ukraine's battle zones was responsible for bringing down the jetliner, killing all 298 passengers and crew on the flight from Amsterdam to Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur.
But the charges against the four brings a tighter focus on the alleged decision-making and suspected Russian involvement in the July 2014 disaster. Moscow denies any role.
"We now have the information, the proof, that the Russian Federation is involved in this tragedy, in this crime, one way or the other," said Dutch chief prosecutor Fred Westerbeke.
The suspects are believed to be in Russia or separatist-held Ukraine, meaning they are out of the reach of Western law enforcement and unlikely to show up at trial scheduled for March.
But the announcement of the charges underscored the tensions between Western Europe and Russia over the war in eastern Ukraine, which is now in its sixth year and has claimed some 13,000 lives.
"Their acts on and around July 2014 have led to the shooting of Flight MH17. Even though they have not pushed the button themselves, there is suspicion that they have closely cooperated" in obtaining and positioning the missile launcher that shot down the jet, Mr. Westerbeke told reporters at The Hague.
The suspects included Igor Girkin, also known as Igor Strelkov, a former colonel in Russia's domestic intelligence service, FSB, who was a leader of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine at the time the Boeing 777 was downed.
Two other suspects have links to Russia's military intelligence unit, known as the GRU, which has taken a higher profile in suspected Russian operations in recent years. Western officials have tied the GRU to the nerve agent poisoning in Britain last year and the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails.
One suspect, Sergey Dubinskiy, was an employee of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency. Another, Oleg Pulatov, was a former GRU Special Forces soldier, international prosecutors said.
The fourth suspect, Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, was described as having no military background but having led a separatist combat unit in eastern Ukraine. The four suspects are charged with causing the crash of the passenger plane and murdering the 298 passengers and crew aboard. The victims included 196 Dutch citizens.
The downing of the jet - some analysts have speculated that separatists were aiming for a Ukrainian military aircraft - proved to be a turning point in the conflict in Ukraine, rallying Western public opinion against Russia.
"The possibility exists the suspects wanted to shoot a military airplane instead of a passenger flight," Mr. Westerbeke said. "Even if that was the original plan, we still hold them responsible for the downing MH17."
A statement from Russia's Foreign Ministry dismissed the charges against the Russian nationals as "absolutely unfounded" and an attempt to "discredit the Russian Federation." It pledged, however, that Russia would continue to work with investigators to "help determine the truth."
Before the Dutch announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia's position on the investigation was "very well known," but he declined to specify whether Russia would hand over any suspects for prosecution.
Still, it did not appear likely that Russia would cooperate. The Kremlin has denied any Russian involvement in the downing of the jet, and it has often criticized the Dutch-led investigation. "I'm not giving any comments," one of the suspects, Mr. Girkin, told Russia's Interfax news agency.
Battles began in 2014 between Ukraine's forces and pro-Moscow separatists in the east of the country. Ukrainian officials and Western allies say fighters and supplies crossed the border from Russia to aid the pro-Moscow militias. Among the supplies that crossed the border, investigators have said, was the Buk missile that shot down the Malaysia Airlines jet.
The prosecutor said that the Dutch authorities would formally ask Russia to issue a summons to those suspects, including Mr. Girkin. Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, and Ukraine, are also part of the investigation, known as the Joint Investigative Team.

Texto completo: From the very start of this presidential campaign season, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has faced a credibility challenge. Lately she has given voters even more reason to question her message and her potential management of the executive branch of the federal government.
The baggage Ms. Warren brought to the campaign included her repeated smearing of her paternal grandparents. The senator has continued to claim implausibly that her late relatives were so racist that they opposed a wedding based on her mother's remote theoretical possibility of Native American ancestry. Ms. Warren, who in fact has no recognized tribal affiliation, has also asked people to believe that she claimed to be "American Indian"—except when applying to the Ivy League.
This month brings a new credibility challenge. Oddly, she and the political activists who know her best seem to agree that she cannot be trusted to responsibly exercise executive authority.
On June 4th Tucker Higgins and Kevin Breuninger of CNBC reported :
A majority of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign staff wants union representation.
Nonmanagement campaign employees authorized International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2320 to represent them in negotiations with campaign leadership, according to Steven Soule, the local's business manager.
"We look to move to the table to come to a bargaining agreement that provides pay and benefits and working conditions that are the best in the nation," Soule said.
The Warren campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If a couple hundred Warren campaign workers believe they need to pay a third party to ensure that Ms. Warren will be a reasonable boss, what does that say to the other 329 million Americans she intends to govern?
Two days after news broke of the unionization of the Warren campaign, Sen. Warren tweeted :
My campaign has submitted their support to join @IBEW 2320. Every worker who wants to join a union, bargain collectively, & make their voice heard should have a chance to do so. The labor movement has long fought for the dignity of working people, & we're proud to be part of it.
Bizarre as it may seem, she's now on record agreeing with her workers that her management alone is not enough to ensure that people can maintain their dignity and be heard in her office.
Of course it's possible that this is merely a political gimmick—lately a few other campaigns have also been unionized. Perhaps the Warren workers are now surrendering dues not because they believe they need a union but in order for the candidate to signal virtue to the labor movement. This scenario would also raise a question of credibility.
But for now let's take Ms. Warren at her word and assume she really believes that, just like corporate managers, she requires significant restraints on her ability to maximize the success of the enterprise. Simple fairness requires her to go well beyond accepting a unionized workforce. Last year in these pages, Sen. Warren announced her "Accountable Capitalism Act," which among other things would require "corporate directors to consider the interests of all major corporate stakeholders—not only shareholders—in company decisions."
Based on her stakeholder model, in which companies have to yield influence to people with no stake in the success of the organization, she should share campaign decision-making power with those who favor expanding economic liberty, not just advisers who endorse her effort to increase federal power.
This brings us to the other credibility question. As far as this column can tell Sen. Warren has stopped calling herself an "American Indian," but now she's calling herself a "capitalist."
Is this label more accurate than her earlier claims of Native American status? It seems that even left-leaning publications are struggling to tell the difference between this self-identified "capitalist" and America's most famous anti-capitalist.
"Are Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders the same?," reads the headline on a story by Tara Golshan in Vox, who notes that the two candidates have "similar policies" but "couldn't be more stylistically different." Ms. Golshan clarifies:
Sanders and Warren are clearly two separate human beings. But within the liberal-to-left political intelligentsia there's a debate: Are they actually the same?...
"Elizabeth and I end up agreeing on a lot of issues," Sanders said at a CNN town hall in April. It's true. Side by side, their agendas don't look too different.
The two candidates share a desire for government job guarantees, socialized medicine and socialized college funding, among other initiatives. Last week in the New York Times Thomas Kaplan and Jim Tankersley wrote:
As the 23 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination struggle to distinguish themselves, Senator Elizabeth Warren has set herself apart with a series of sweeping proposals that would significantly remake the American economy...
Her proposals would... allow the federal government to more aggressively steer the development of industries. She has called for splintering technology companies, like Amazon, that millions of consumers rely on in their daily lives. She would reduce the rewards for entrepreneurs to build billionaire fortunes and for companies to create global supply chains, scrambling the incentives for work, investment and economic growth.
Their colleague Emily Bazelon notes in the New York Times magazine:
As a presidential candidate, Warren has rolled out proposal after proposal... On the trail, she says "I have a plan for that" so often that it has turned into a T-shirt slogan.
And the plans always seem to involve more government power.

Meanwhile at the kick-off event for President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign, a Trump supporter interviewed by the Journal's Michael Bender and Catherine Lucey made the concise case for re-election:
"I wish that people would ignore his personality and look at what he's done," said Chelle Daines, a 67-year-old rally participant from Deland, Fla. She added that Mr. Trump will win next year because "the socialists are making it easy to go to Trump."

Trump's mental gymnastics are baffling

Texto completo: Only a man who is, like, really smart could perform mental gymnastics at the level President Trump has attained over the past few days.
On Saturday, Trump declared that The New York Times committed a "virtual act of Treason" by reporting on a U.S. cyber campaign against Russia.
Mere seconds later, he proclaimed that the supposedly treasonous report was "ALSO, NOT TRUE!"
Thus, in Trump's telling, did the journalists commit the capital offense of ... divulging false state secrets?
During his interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, meanwhile, Trump denied that internal Trump campaign polling showed him trailing: "Those polls don't exist." Trump then fired his campaign pollsters for leaking ... the supposedly nonexistent polls.
During the ABC interview, Trump also said that if he received dirt on his opponent from a foreign country, he would accept it without calling the FBI — and that his FBI director was "wrong" to say the FBI should know of such offers. Soon thereafter, Trump told "Fox & Friends" a contrary view: "Of course" he would tell the FBI.
F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that "the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function." Trump's ability to function is a matter of much dispute, but if the ability to hold opposing thoughts in mind is a measure of intelligence, Trump is a very stable genius indeed. Nobody contradicts himself as forcefully, fluently and frequently. Last December, Trump declared that "we have defeated ISIS." The very next day he said that Russia, Iran and others "will have to fight ISIS" without us.
In recent weeks, Trump has said Robert Mueller conducted his probe in an honorable way and his findings offered full vindication and exoneration. During roughly the same period, Trump has also promoted the contrary idea that Mueller's report is "total bullshit," not to mention "fabricated" and "pure, political garbage."
Last month, Trump pronounced China's Huawei "very dangerous" as a military and security threat; in the next sentence, he said this dangerous threat should be included in a trade deal. Trump earlier this year declared an emergency on the border because of a migration "crisis"; the same day, he said, "I didn't need to do this" — and, two months earlier, he had boasted that the "border is tight."
In January, Trump proclaimed, in all caps, "MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL." Exactly 11 minutes later, he complained that the border wall was in jeopardy because Democrats provided "NOTHING" to pay for it.
Trump has one of the "greatest memories of all time"; accordingly, he could not recall the answer to Mueller's questions at least 37 times.
In January 2018, he told a bipartisan group of lawmakers he would sign any immigration deal they sent him. The next day, he said he would not sign such a bill without funding for his wall.
In February 2018, Trump proposed comprehensive legislation with gun-safety measures, saying "it would be nice if we could add everything onto it." Twenty minutes later, he said he supported a piecemeal approach.
In June 2018, he tweeted an all-caps call: "HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL." Three days later, he tweeted: "I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill."
How does he do it? My second-rate intelligence can't figure it out.

Yes, Elizabeth Warren can win

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren can do it.
Yes, she can.
I'll concede that betting on winners and losers in the Democratic presidential free-for-all is like betting on Chicago weather in June. Only fools and hardcore gamblers would dare.
But if I had to gamble, I'd bet my collectible Obama-Biden button that Warren will be among the top two contenders in the Democratic race.
What the heck, I'll gamble big: I'll stake that button on her being the nominee.
I've been sensing Warren's rise for several weeks, even before her poll numbers went up and the media air around her brightened. In different cities, with various people of liberal but not identical tastes, I've been asking a question that turns into conversations that go like this:
Who do you like among the Democrats running for president?
Anyone who can beat Trump.
OK, fine. But who?
I have to say I'm liking Elizabeth Warren.
Of the 23 Democrats who have announced they're running, hers is the name that comes up most, and not just with resignation but with enthusiasm.
I've heard some interest in Kamala Harris, the smart and tough U.S. senator from California, and in Pete Buttigieg, the smart and charming mayor of South Bend, Ind. Bernie and Biden -- both so well-known they don't need full names -- bubble into the conversation, but typically with a sigh, not a cheer.
The rest? They don't exist.
Conversations, obviously, aren't science, and we should all be wary of polls and media spin. November 2016 wasn't the first time the pundits and the polls were wrong.
But at least for now Elizabeth Warren, U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is on the rise, and even if she doesn't win, she's defining the debate.
In the past few days, she has been profiled by The New York Times ("Elizabeth Warren is Completely Serious"), and The New Yorker ("Can Elizabeth Warren Win?") Other stories have noted her nipping at the heels of Biden and Bernie.
Naturally, given that success always breeds critics, there are contrarians, like the Fox News analyst Howard Kurtz, who raised a skeptical eyebrow under the headline: "Elizabeth Warren Surges on Flattering Profiles, Pundit Praise."
And yet even Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host who often reacts to liberal ideas as if they were raw sewage, devoted a laudatory segment recently to Warren's cannily named "economic patriotism" plan.
So what is Warren fighting for?
Her policy proposals are wonky so they're not easy to condense into a column, but if you want the details, they're not hard to find. Part of what makes her attractive is that she knows stuff. Serious stuff. Her fight is grounded not just in passion but in knowledge.
It's a fight against economic injustice, but not one based on pitting average Americans against each other. It's a fight against an economic system that privileges corporations, big banks and the uber-wealthy. It's founded on an understanding that while discrimination of many kinds runs deep and poisonous in our society, those sicknesses won't be fixed without a restructuring of the economy.
Under her plan, the rich would stay rich -- but they'd pay more in taxes. Those taxes would help do things like wipe out $640 billion in student debt. She has detailed plans for many other issues, too, from fair housing to opioid addiction.
Some of Warren's critics call her a socialist. A former Republican, she calls herself a capitalist.
"I believe in markets," she has said, "... But only fair markets, markets with rules."
As Emily Bazelon's recent New York Times profile notes:
"'There's a concerted effort to equate Warren with Bernie, to make her seem more radical," says Luigi Zingales, a University of Chicago economist and co-host of the podcast Capitalisn't. But Wall Street and its allies "are more afraid of her than Bernie," Zingales continued, "because when she says she'll change the rules, she's the one who knows how to do it.'"
Warren has plenty of critics. She's too far left. She's not left enough. She's too wonky. She lectures. At 69, she's too old. And -- insert eye roll here -- a woman can't beat Trump.
Who can beat Trump? We don't know yet. The country continues to evolve. The candidates continue to emerge. Few of us can know today which candidate we'll vote for.
But a smart woman with a good plan has as good a shot as anyone. Warren deserves to be heard. Don't rely on me. Go read a responsible profile of her. Read her policy proposals.
And if I lose that Obama-Biden collectible on this bet? I'll always have my 2000 campaign button for Al Gore to keep me warm.

Iran irony: Trump brought all this on himself

Texto completo: The “breaking news” alert from the New York Times Monday afternoon read:
“President Trump ordered another 1,000 troops to the Middle East and vowed again that Iran would not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon”
I could’ve sworn that President Trump inherited a deal, signed by Iran and the U.S. and a gaggle of the most important U.S. allies and all five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council (including Russia and China), which the vast majority of the smart, sane world agreed would prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. But Trump knew better.
The deal had invasive, unscheduled inspections by international inspectors to ensure that Iran was living up to its provisions. And our country’s most important allies agreed that Iran was living up to it, and urged him not to withdraw from it for fear that, if the U.S. pulled out, the deal might fall apart and Iran might be tempted to resume its work toward developing nukes.
(Here, if you care to read it, is the Washington Post Fact-Checker’s assessment of the various misstatements by Trump when he gave his “reasons” for pulling out of the deal. Spoiler alert: The facticity of his reasons did not hold up well.)
I’m not saying this is a fact (as if certain presidents even care about those things anyway), but it’s pretty likely that if Iran does go back to pursuing development of a usable nuke any time soon, it will be because Trump dissed Iran and all those key U.S. allies by pulling out of the deal under which Iran agreed not to seek such a weapon.
And this definitely isn’t fact — it’s a fear — but I fear that the current POTUS is getting so worried about his chances of winning a second term in 2020 that he thinks maybe a nice war against a nation of subhuman Muslims might improve his chances.
It’s been known to work.

The tricky politics of a US-Mexico deal on migration

Texto completo: President Trump has reached an agreement with Mexico regarding that country’s response to the flow of Central American migrant on their way to the United States. The New York Times editorial board, and other critics on the left, immediately accused President Trump of having obtained nothing new but using previously agreed upon concessions from Mexico as the premise to back down from his ill-considered threat of tariffs against Mexico. That criticism, in turn, caused Trump to assert he had a secret additional agreement he reached with Mexico.
Trump claimed: “We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico … It will be revealed in the not too distant future.” Mexican Foreign Minister Ebrard responded that Mexico might consider a “third country” agreement if progress on immigration was not satisfactory after a month and a half. I suspect both men are describing the same thing, with some license for diplomatic ambiguity between a “fully signed” agreement and an agreement to “consider” further measures.
Here is what a “third country” agreement means: Under American asylum law, “an alien who is physically present in the United States . . . may apply for asylum” if the person has “a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion” in the person’s country of residence. However, if there is a “bilateral or multilateral agreement” with another country without such fear of persecution, where the asylum applicant can be sent, the applicant loses the right to asylum in the U.S. That is the “third country” agreement likely under consideration. The consequences of Mexico reaching such an agreement is that hundreds of thousands of Guatemalans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Haitians and others now accumulating at the border would instead stay in Mexico.
Mexico has an unemployment rate of 3.5%. Though the migrants are largely unskilled, Mexico has need of labor. The proportion of unskilled labor in the American economy, by contrast, is much lower. While indigenous languages are widely spoken by the migrants, Spanish unites the majority of them and would help them integrate into Mexican society. The immigrants are willing to work. Mexico’s economy needs the workers — even if the migrants would prefer to get to the U.S.
American asylum law is really the wrong vehicle for dealing with this issue. Asylum was meant to protect individuals fleeing from government persecution. Most migrants coming to U.S. borders today are fleeing gang violence and severe poverty in Central America and Haiti, not persecution. Europe has experienced a similar influx from Syria and North Africa over the last nine years, and every famine produces more economic emigrants. Developed economy countries negotiate with the United Nations on the number of migrants they will take every year; asylum seekers come in above that number.
The elasticity of the American legal definition of asylum entitles anyone who touches U.S. soil to try to prove that conditions in their home country, including inability of the government to protect them from gang violence, amounts to “persecution on the basis of being in a particular social group.” The more honest approach would be to construe asylum as it was originally intended, but not turn our backs on those migrants seeking a better life. The world has a huge number of migrants fleeing because their home country is in civil war, overrun by gangs, suffering famine or just very poor. Every developed country, including the U.S. and Mexico, should reach agreements on how many each can take.
A “third country” agreement just between the U.S. and Mexico runs a steep gauntlet in Mexican politics: President Lopez Obrador cannot be perceived as caving into Trump. Expanding the discussion beyond just asylum seekers, and including all countries capable of accepting immigrants, would be more comprehensive and would allow both presidents to be seen as statesmen.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, will not be transferred to New York's infamous Rikers Island jail after the Department of Justice cited health concerns.
Manafort is serving seven and a half years in federal prison on charges related to his foreign lobbying efforts as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was being held in a federal prison in Pennsylvania but has been transferred to a federal facility in Manhattan, Reuters reported.
However, Manafort was supposed to be transferred to Rikers Island in New York later this month as he awaits trial in state court for multiple charges under New York law for residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business, according to the New York Times.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen last week sent a letter to Manhattan prosecutors saying that the Department of Justice was monitoring where Manafort would be held in New York, the Times reported.
And, Manafort will no longer be transferred to Rikers Island, according to the Times. A senior DOJ official in a statement to ABC News said that the department got involved after Manafort's attorneys raised concerns "related to his health and personal safety. "
During Manafort's federal trial, his lawyers said he had gout.
President Donald Trump has in the past said that he thought Manafort's sentence was "very unfair" and has complained about how his former campaign manager has been treated.

‘Charged’ examines the role of prosecutors in the U.S. justice system

Resumen: Writer and lawyer Emily Bazelon argues that the election of more reform-minded prosecutors could help reduce America’s soaring incarceration rates.

Texto completo: Not long after his 2017 election as Brooklyn’s district attorney, Eric Gonzalez gave a speech in which he declared that “The real cultural shift I’m going to be asking prosecutors in my office to make is considering jail as the last option.” In most American cities that would be an extraordinary statement coming from a prosecutor. In this case, however, it followed a campaign during which one commentator tweeted that it was “stunning to see Brooklyn DA candidates competing to go softer on crime.” 
According to Emily Bazelon, the country is in dire need of prosecutors who think like Gonzalez. In her rigorous, compassionate, and vital book, Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration , she shines light on a critical but under-examined feature of the criminal justice system: the role of prosecutors in America’s crisis-level incarceration rates. People like Gonzalez, she contends, who are thinking differently about fairness and mercy, represent “the most promising means of reform … on the political landscape.”
A staff writer for the New York Times Magazine who’s also a lawyer, Bazelon argues that the explosion in America’s prison population (currently around 2.2 million people, a number the author believes could be safely cut in half) has largely resulted from the imbalance in our justice system, which gives the upper hand to the prosecution. Most district attorneys in this country are elected and commonly strive to present themselves to constituents as tough on crime; Bazelon laments that DAs often appear more concerned with notching wins than with serving justice.
Bazelon methodically demonstrates that prosecutors, at every step of the process, have outsize power, whether it’s in deciding how a defendant will be charged, in influencing how bail is set, even in choosing to punish black defendants more severely than white ones. 
The author is particularly strong in arguing for the elimination of cash bail, which, in effect, punishes defendants for being poor. Those in jail who can’t afford bail often feel pressured into accepting a plea deal rather than languishing in pretrial detention, especially when prosecutors threaten them with stiff sentences if they risk a trial and lose. (It’s disturbing, but not terribly surprising, that “about 18 percent of exonerations – DNA and non-DNA, death sentences and other penalties – involve defendants who pleaded guilty.”) The overwhelming majority of criminal convictions result not from trials but from guilty pleas – the rate is as high as 95% in many states.  
Bazelon gives these processes a human face by following two young people through the system and alternating their stories throughout the book. One is 20-year-old Kevin (not his real name), a Brooklynite from the housing projects of Brownsville who’s arrested on a gun charge. The other is Noura Jackson, a Tennessee teenager convicted of the brutal 2005 murder of her mother; she spent nearly a decade in prison before the state’s supreme court, citing prosecutorial misconduct, overturned her conviction.
In tracking the two cases, Bazelon deftly shows how different approaches to prosecution can produce vastly different outcomes. Jackson was the victim of an overzealous prosecutor determined to win a conviction despite glaring weaknesses in the case. In Brooklyn, on the other hand, Kevin, after pleading guilty to criminal possession of a weapon, was allowed to enter a year-long diversion program that offered him the opportunity to stay out of prison and have his conviction erased from his record if he followed a strict set of rules (random drug testing, nightly curfew, visits with a social worker).
The two cases highlight the difference between prosecutors who use their power primarily to lock people up and those who believe that the public interest is better served by offering, where appropriate, social services and second chances. Bazelon urges us to consider, too, what we want our criminal justice system to accomplish. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who spent five years as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office, looked back on the experience and said, “We think we’re keeping people safe from criminals. We’re just making worse criminals.”
Mass incarceration is such an intractable American problem, but one gets the feeling that “Charged” could be a game-changer, giving voice and momentum to a growing desire for reform. (The lengthy appendix, which lays out concrete steps to fix the broken system, will surely help.) There are 2,400 prosecutors in elected office across the country. While reform-minded DAs are still in the minority, they’ve won races in cities and counties nationwide, including Philadelphia, Houston, and Kansas City, Kansas. “Local prosecutors handle more than 95 percent of the nation’s criminal docket,” Bazelon observes, meaning that change, if it is to come, will come from the grassroots. To ensure that meaningful criminal justice reform is enacted, as this important and powerful book urges, citizens must begin by paying attention.

Texto completo: Sometimes authoritarian diktats glide so smoothly off the tongue they are barely perceptible to the human ear.
That was the case last week when Kirsten Gillibrand, Democratic candidate for president and high-profile U.S. Senator from New York, declared the end of politics.
Only a few national newspapers and news programs paid much attention, but Gillibrand had essentially said it.
Politics are dead.
"(It is wrong to) deny women ... basic human rights," she told the Des Moines Register editorial board. "I think there's some issues that have such moral clarity that we have, as a society, decided that the other side is not acceptable."
The illegitimate other side here is the self-described "pro-life" opposition to legalized abortion. And one can only presume, given Gillibrand's maximalist view, it includes those who would keep abortion legal but also impose restrictions on it.
Gillibrand added that opposition to abortion should be regarded in the same way we regard racism. In other words, critics of abortion need to be banished from the public square. They need to be treated with all the loathing and disdain we reserve for racial bigots.
They should never be granted access to polite society. Never hold corporate jobs. Never rise to any position of legitimate authority. They should be shunned and ignored – made so radioactive their views are no longer to be considered. Only condemned.
And that especially goes for federal judges one suspects may harbor anti-abortion views.
"Imagine saying it's OK to appoint a judge who's racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic," said Gillibrand. "Asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America, I don't think those are political issues anymore."
Not a political issue?
There has been no more sharply divided issue in this country over the last half-century than legalized abortion. A majority of Americans support it, but a majority also either oppose or want restrictions on it. Former President Bill Clinton reflected this point of view when he said abortion should be "safe, legal and rare."
To declare "case closed" on an issue so polarized and broadly debated, is to say Kirsten Gillibrand and those who share her point of view dictate what Americans can and cannot discuss.
The American left has been rightly appalled at the authoritarian impulses of Donald Trump, including his Sunday tweet storm that again calls the New York Times and Washington Post "the enemy of the people" and asks if his supporters will insist he serve a third (and unconstitutional) term.
Where is their condemnation of Gillibrand, who just last week unilaterally decided the abortion debate is over and her side won?
I wonder if she would like to explain to American Hipanics, an important constituency in the Democratic Party, that their mouths have been zipped.
Nearly half of them believe abortion should be illegal in "all or most cases" (44 percent according to 2018 Pew Research Center Poll.)
Abortion has been debated rigorously in our lifetimes because it is morally ambiguous. There are no clear lines. The truth depends on how you view the fetus, how it is defined and whether it warrants protection.
All of us, pro-abortion and anti-abortion, should be conflicted about the issue because the choices are stark and have real-life consequences.
Whether you believe a fetus worthy of rights or not, abortion is still a jarring act – the dismemberment and vacuuming of life that left untouched would become an independent, conscious human being.
On the flip-side, talk to doctors who worked American emergency rooms before Roe v. Wade and hear the horrors of women who came in butchered or poisoned by back-alley abortionists.
If we make abortion illegal, we shove it back to the shadows and leave it to the butchers.
With no clear lines of agreement, the issue demands discussion and ongoing access to the American conscience.
Politics is the way we deal with such disagreements in our society, with words, not clubs.
Take that away and what are we left with? "Politics by other means."
As a leader with a high profile in American politics, Gillibrand's comments are dangerous and should be called out. Particularly by liberals, who in these days are especially attuned to and appalled by the murmurings of authoritarians.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump respondió a sus bajos números en las encuestas despidiendo a tres de los cinco esncuestadores de su campaña luego que se filtaron a la prensa las preocupantes cifras del apoyo electoral del magante en estados claves para su reelección en 2020.
La medida se produce después de que la semana pasada, varios medios de comunicación informaran sobre la existencia de una encuesta de 17 estados, que supuso muy malas noticias para la reelección de Trump.
El sondeo, realizado por Tony Fabrizio, encuestador líder de la campaña de Trump, entre el 13 de marzo y el 28 de marzo, encontró a Trump detrás del ex vicepresidente Joe Biden con dos dígitos en todos los estados que se consideran cruciales para su victoria en 2020.
Esa misma encuesta que se filtró a la prensa también mostró a Trump con un desempeño inferior en los estados republicanos confiables que no han sido competitivos durante décadas en las elecciones presidenciales.
La decisión de la campaña de despiddir a sus propios encuestadores , Michael Baselice, Adam Geller y Brett Lloyd, tiene el propósito de evitar nuevas fugas de datos de encuestas internas, informó el New York Times el domingo.
Trump ha negado airadamente la cobertura de los números en los últimos días, y dijo a ABC News en una entrevista transmitida el jueves: “Esas encuestas no existen. Acabo de reunirme con alguien que es un encuestador y estoy ganando en todas partes, así que simplemente No sé de qué estás hablando “.
Trump también tuiteó que sus números son “los mejores números que hemos tenido”, y afirmó que los números informados eran de “Encuestas falsas”.

Campaign drops pollsters

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's reelection campaign has severed ties with some of its pollsters after the leak of months-old surveys showed him trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in key states, according to multiple reports.
NBC News first reported that the pollsters were ousted following revelations that internal campaign polling from March showed Trump trailing Biden in traditionally Democratic-leaning states such as Pennsylvania that cemented the president's victory in 2016, as well as in swing states and some typically Republican strongholds.
Even in the solidly Republican state of Texas, which last voted for a Democrat for president in 1976, Trump led by just 2 percentage points in the March polls, NBC said. In 2016 Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 percentage points.
The campaign's move, which saw the purge of three of its five pollsters, was aimed at limiting the number of outsiders who could leak unfavorable poll numbers, according to the New York Times.
Biden is the front-runner in the large Democratic primary field, but his strength and Trump's possible weakness could change greatly in the months ahead. Trump famously surprised pollsters and pundits, most of who confidently predicted right up until the 2016 election that he would lose.
The Trump campaign and the White House didn't immediately return requests for comment. Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, told the Times in a statement that the leaked figures were "ancient" and didn't reflect current dynamics, such as the end of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

Texto completo: FALMOUTH - Portland's two Bach festivals - the Bach Virtuosi Festival, which wrapped up last week, and the Portland Bach Experience, which presented its opening concert Friday evening at the Episcopal Church of St. Mary, in Falmouth - have worked hard this year to differentiate themselves.
The Virtuosi offered straightforward performances built almost entirely around a balance of Bach's sacred and secular music, the principal exception being a concert devoted to music by Bach's predecessors and successors, the latter heard chiefly in works directly inspired by Bach. The Portland Bach Experience has taken a path that, depending on what you want or expect in a music festival, is either innovative or puzzling.
For starters, its schedule is heavy on events in which music seems more like an add-on than the principal focus - brunch and beer concerts, for example, and family attractions, like a musical instrument petting zoo and a class where dance moves are used to teach children about music. The festival's website also seems meant for people who don't care what music is being played - traditionally an important factor in choosing concerts to attend. For several events, the composers are listed, but the works are not.
The program book does list all the music, but when you page through it, you can't help but notice that there's very little Bach in this Bach festival. The opening concert was devoted fully to Monteverdi's "Vespers" (1610). A program of music in early 17th century Mantua includes works by Monteverdi's contemporaries, and one devoted to music of the Thirty Years' War offers works by Martin Luther, Pope Leo X and plenty of Heinrich SchÃ¼tz. It's all great stuff. But where's the Bach?
When Bach's music does turn up, it's performed exclusively in settings where other things will compete for your attention. You can hear Bach's "Coffee" Cantata at a brunch concert at the Portland Museum of Art on Sunday morning. Bach's first cello suite (or, actually, half of it) can be heard, amid works by seven other composers, at the "Bach and Beer" cocktail hour concert at the United States Custom House, on Tuesday.
The biggest Bach offering will have come and gone by the time you read this, but it is worth noting. Called "Suite Ride Through Portland," it promised all six of Bach's cello suites at different outdoor locations around Portland on Saturday (although locations were listed for only five). And for anyone apprehensive about the likelihood that ambient noise and other distractions might impinge on the experience of hearing these magnificent, unaccompanied cello works, the festival leaves little doubt that your fears are well-founded, with suggestions like "Children are encouraged to hear Suites 3 & 4 as inspiration for dance or narrative play," or "Enjoy a Bachsicle as you dream along to Suite 5."
The Monteverdi "Vespers," thankfully, was presented as it ought to be - in a straightforward performance at a church with fairly good acoustics, by minimal (but powerful) vocal and instrumental forces. Emily Isaacson, the festival's artistic director, conducted the choral movements, but wisely sat out the pieces for only two or three singers with continuo (generally theorbo, played with a fine sense of color and texture by Deborah Fox) and sometimes also organ (played by Michael Beattie), where a conductor would be superfluous.
Monteverdi was known, at the time, as a composer of madrigals, in which the music brought the texts to life in a vivid, painterly way, and he applied those skills amply in the "Vespers," his first collection of sacred settings. It is an extraordinary work - sacred music on the grandest, most dramatic scale, with choruses scored for up to 10 independent vocal lines, and with singers and instrumentalists placed in different locations to create an echo effect.
There are no surviving records proving that Monteverdi performed the work at his audition for the position of maestro di cappella at the Basilica San Marco, in Venice in August 1613. But he was in Venice for the Feast of the Assumption, for which this music would have been ideally suited, and his appointment to the post was announced four days later.
At its best - for example, in the opening "Deus in adjutorium," for which Monteverdi audaciously borrowed the vibrant Toccata that opens his first opera, "L'Orfeo" (1607) - the Friday evening performance was vibrant and joyful, beautifully blended and bristling with the fervor one would expect in the setting of lines from a Psalm pleading for salvation. Elsewhere, there were occasionally ragged choral entrances, and occasional flaws in exposed instrumental writing, but these were fleeting and scarcely tarnished the performance as a whole.
Among the vocalists, Sumner Thompson, Jonas Budris, Madeline Healey, Sarah Brailey and Kate Maroney stood out, but all 10 singers contributed robust and sometimes affecting performances. So did the instrumentalists, most notably the cornetto and trombone players, who doubled impressively on recorders.
Still, if Bach was to be an also-ran, wouldn't it have made sense for the festival, now in only its second year, to rename itself the Portland Baroque Experience?

Texto completo: It is hard for Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general, to find a silver lining in President Trump's election. But if one exists, she said, "it's that you do see women engaged in a different way."
In a panel discussion, Ms. Yates and Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, discussed the recent abortion bills in Alabama and other states, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's calculations on impeachment and more.
But above all, they emphasized the importance of increasing women's representation in government and the electorate. If not for women -- particularly women of color -- Roy Moore, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, would be in the Senate right now, Ms. Yates noted.
"Until we have enough voices that look like us at the table," Ms. Jarrett said, "it's going to be very hard to force change."
[Video: Valerie Jarrett, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, and Sally Yates, former United States deputy attorney general, in conversation with Kara Swisher, contributing opinion writer at The New York Times. Watch on YouTube.]
In the discussion, Ms. Jarrett and Ms. Yates expressed a deep sense of alarm about the state of American politics -- not just about Mr. Trump's norm-breaking presidency, but also about the slew of highly restrictive state abortion laws passed since Mr. Trump cemented a conservative majority on the Supreme Court less than a year ago.
Alabama's law, a near-complete ban on abortion, has gotten the most national attention, but Ms. Jarrett and Ms. Yates said they did not view it as the most dangerous -- it is so extreme, Ms. Yates said, that even conservative judges might reject it. Ms. Jarrett said she was more alarmed by the fact that numerous states had passed restrictions of various degrees, searching for "that perfect test case" to force the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade.
The environment, Ms. Yates said, "almost feels 'Handmaid's Tale'-like."
She and Ms. Jarrett also expressed concern about the long-term effects of Mr. Trump's shattering of presidential norms.
"It's the damage and ripping apart of the fabric of institutions and norms that is hard to figure out -- how we put all that back together again -- and it's become so normalized that we've lost our ability to be shocked by these things," said Ms. Yates, who was fired by Mr. Trump 10 days into his presidency after she refused to defend the administration's ban on immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. "Indifference to truth, I think, is going to live with us a lot longer than any of the policies."
On impeachment, however, she and Ms. Jarrett declined to second-guess Ms. Pelosi, who has taken a cautious approach.
"She knows her caucus better than anyone else, and she has a good feel for the American people, and she does not think it's time for that move," Ms. Jarrett said. "I go along with her because no one has better political instincts."
The most important focus, they said, ought to be the 2020 election.
"I think women's voices are now at a very important decibel, and the question is, can we continue that through the next election?" Ms. Jarrett said. "Don't say it can't happen again. It jolly well will if we don't get out and get engaged."
Toward the end of the event, the discussion turned toward the double standards for women running for office -- including the six women now running for president.
"The likability quotient -- you sure never really see that issue being bandied about so much with men," Ms. Yates said. "Women have another hoop to jump through to have everything balanced just right so that people will find them authoritative, but not threatening or, God forbid, shrill."
Even so, Ms. Jarrett said she believed the country was ready to elect a woman president.
"Things seem impossible until they seem inevitable," she said.

Texto completo: President Trump's campaign is cutting ties with three members of his polling team after grim numbers showing him trailing former vice president Joe Biden in several battleground states were leaked to the media last week, according to several officials with knowledge of the matter.
Days ahead of Trump's official launch of his reelection bid on Tuesday, the campaign is severing its relationship with Brett Loyd, Mike Baselice and Adam Geller while keeping pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin.
The officials, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss internal moves. The Trump campaign declined to comment. NBC first reported on the campaign's actions.
The news follows reports - first by Politico and later by the New York Times - on a 17-state internal poll conducted by Fabrizio. The data, later reported by ABC and NBC, show Trump trailing Biden by double digits in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida and Michigan, where Trump narrowly edged out Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. The poll also found Trump behind Biden in several other states that were key to the president's win - Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Georgia - while holding a narrow edge in strongly Republican Texas.
Publicly, Trump initially declared that the results had been fabricated by the media and "don't even exist." But Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, later confirmed that the results were indeed from a poll conducted by the campaign in March, and on Friday, ABC News published the results.
Privately, the president was livid that the numbers leaked out, according to White House and campaign officials.
"He is madder that the numbers are out than that the numbers exist," said one senior administration official.
Trump's "kill the messenger" strategy in response to the leaked polling data reflects his desire to show strength at all times, even in the face of less-than-favorable news from within his own campaign.
The disclosure of the polling data has upended what has been a relatively smooth-running reelection operation so far - and highlights the stark challenges the president faces in forging a coalition to repeat his 2016 victory. While there has been some tension between Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and White House adviser, and Republican National Committee officials, it has largely remained behind the scenes.
The campaign has taken particular pride in running a more functional operation than in 2016. Advisers such as Parscale, Justin Clark and Bill Stepien have visited key states such as Pennsylvania to meet with state party leadership and activists. The campaign has moved to install Trump loyalists as state party chairmen and delegates for the convention and has sought to project a sense of unity with the RNC in its sprawling headquarters overlooking the Potomac River in Rosslyn. They have hired dozens of people - eclipsing the size of the ragtag Trump operation in 2016.
Several campaign advisers said they were dismayed by the leak of the polling data - but that the numbers, and conversations with advisers, explained Trump's fixation on Biden, who is leading early public polls in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
Trump has complained to staffers about the polling data disclosure for several days, White House and campaign advisers said.
The internal poll shows there is significant work to be done and that Trump might have turned off some of the voters he will need to have a chance at winning.
Loyd is president and chief executive of Polling Company/WomanTrend, which was founded by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.
Baselice is the founder of Austin-based polling firm Baselice & Associates. He was also the longtime pollster for former Texas governor Rick Perry (R), who is now energy secretary.
Geller was previously a pollster for former New Jersey governor Chris Christie (R) and is the founder and chief executive of National Research.
Loyd and Baselice did not respond to requests for comment Sunday, and Geller declined to comment.
After the leak of the internal polling, both Parscale and Fabrizio argued that the numbers were out-of-date and that once the Trump campaign "defined" Democrats to respondents, the numbers shifted in Trump's favor.
"The Trump internal campaign data being reported is incomplete and misleading," Fabrizio said in a statement Friday. "The old numbers from March being reported represent a worst-case scenario in the most unfavorable turnout model possible."
Yet public polls, too, have shown that Trump as president remains mired around 40 percent approval and has never been above water since he took office.
A new NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday shows Trump's job approval rating at 44 percent. The survey showed only 11 percent of Democrats, 17 percent of African Americans, 32 percent of Latinos and 36 percent of women approve of the job Trump is doing as president.
Trump's approval rating among Republicans, however, remains high at 84 percent, giving him a solid electoral base in reliably red states such as Alabama, Mississippi and the Dakotas.
And despite the internal poll data, Trump retains the power of incumbency, with Election Day 17 months away and Democrats' first presidential nominating contests in eight months.

Fun experience for guests of any age

Texto completo: There is an unwritten rule that professional theater critics do not participate in standing ovations at the end of performances.
To some extent, this is due to the "American Idol"-ization of this country, in which the end of a performance has become a signal for audiences to automatically jump to their feet and cheer.
It is gratifying to report that our local audiences -- unlike their Broadway cousins -- tend not to engage in such enthusiasms.
What to do, then, when the critic's 5-year-old daughter leaps to her feet and cheers during the curtain call for "Disney's Beauty and the Beast," now playing in the Harold and Jean Miner Theatre at Parkland College?
Grin and bear it.
This 14th annual Kathy Murphy Student Production of the Champaign Urbana Theatre Company showcases the diverse talent of young people who range in age from middle school to high school. It is a superb opportunity for 'tweens and teens to build their confidence and to explore the human experience as they mature.
Director Whitney Havice wrangles her cast of more than 30 young performers into a consistent narrative of this now-classic musical, which in 1993 established Disney as an anchor tenant in New York's Broadway theater district. Choreographer Ashley Giberson's pleasing work adds to the storytelling with well-organized choral numbers that include some ballet and tap.
Thursday's opening night was partly marred by body microphones that frequently popped, clicked and otherwise malfunctioned. It was a marvel of composure to witness these young performers soldiering on through the technical difficulties without seeming to miss a beat. A rolling scenery piece also malfunctioned, which seemed to change the dramatic composition of a scene. But these things happen on Broadway, too.
Of particular note was the performance of Emmy Daniels as Belle, the young girl who "tames" a literal beast of a man. Daniels has a powerful voice and delivers the emotional impact of dramatic moments with significant force.
Jerry Strain, who plays the Beast, conveys the humanity that lies beneath the character's gruff exterior. Belle gets involved with the Beast when she goes to his enchanted castle to rescue her beloved father, Maurice (Kabriel Schuster).
The magic spell cast upon the Beast has turned his staff into a grandfather clock, a candelabra, a teapot, a broken cup and any number of dancing plates and silverware. Roger Holben (Cogsworth), Josiah Zielke (Lumire), Emma Loewenstein (Babette), Natalie Deptula (Mrs. Potts), Abigail Eilbracht (Madame de la Grand Bouche) and Ben Summers (Chip) all have moments that delight the audience.
The cost of newsprint and ink being what it is today, we cannot include the names of every young person who contributed to this production. (Including the orchestra and technical team, the number runs to several dozen.) It would be churlish, however, not to mention the amusing work of William Curtis as the vain, overbearing Gaston, accompanied by his cartoonish foil, LeFou (Laramie Ziegler). These two plot and scheme to convince Belle that she should marry the handsome Gaston.
It is fair to say that this production is an all-ages affair in terms of potential audience. Opening night saw babes in arms and an age range that included toddlers to teenagers.
One family even came with three little girls each dressed in Belle's iconic golden ball gown. Throughout the performance, there were occasional exclamations of momentary fear mixed with joyful laughter.
In the second act, one girl sitting nearby said excitedly in a stage whisper, "Oh, man! It's so funny! Gosh!" It startled nearby adults and elicited a ripple of laughter.
On the ride home, the critic's daughter, herself a veteran audience member of Broadway shows, was asked why she stood and cheered.
"I love Belle," she said.
It's likely that your children will, too.

Your home won't fund retirement

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families. It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location.
The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well.
But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location. You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump and his administration have been carrying out a near-constant war on science.
They are slashing common-sense regulations and censoring science to enrich their fossil fuel industry backers, exposing the country and the whole world to potentially catastrophic consequences. They are literally willing to endanger human lives and the very future of humanity for corporate profit.
A recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, “Science under Siege at the Department of the Interior,” documents how the Trump team has set out to obfuscate the findings of scientists through the use of censorship and distortion. And just this month, the State Department blocked a department official from testifying to Congress on the “possibly catastrophic” security impacts of climate change, even as an Australian study warned that civilization itself could be under dire threat by 2050.
Recently, the Department of Energy began referring to natural gas as “freedom gas,” which sounds like something straight out of satire site The Onion. Unintentional humor aside, this choice of terminology resembles the calculated debasement of language by totalitarian states.
In November, when a report by government scientists contradicted Trump’s position and showed that the United States will suffer devastating consequences from climate change, the president simply declared that reality was irrelevant. “I don’t believe it” was his response.
Now there are fresh signs that the administration intends to actively interfere in research by federal scientists. The New York Times reports that scientists who prepare the National Climate Assessment will be instructed not to include the worst-case scenarios of climate change in their reports, so the full extent of potential impacts will be hidden from readers. They will also be asked to project their model results through 2040 instead of the end of the century, masking some of the most dire effects of climate change.
The administration is also reportedly setting up a “review panel” to publicly scrutinize the conclusions of the National Climate Assessment. Given the administration’s track record, it wouldn’t be surprising if the “review panel” is stacked with industry hacks or scientific outcasts like William Happer - Trump’s reported choice for chairman, who has likened what he termed the “demonization” of carbon emissions to the Holocaust.
Governments that respect democracy, transparency and truth don’t systematically obstruct scientific research and harass scientists. Nor do they resort to crude propagandistic terms like “freedom gas” to mask the truth about their agenda.

Viewpoints, Kevin Lerner: What conservative critics get right - and wrong - about the media

Texto completo: Levin's book attempts to reinforce a common argument: that the American "media," which he writes about as if it were a single, monolithic entity, is hopelessly liberal in its worldview, inexplicably invested in the success of the Democratic Party and therefore unworthy of the trust of Levin's readers.
"Unfreedom of the Press" joins a centuries-old lineage of attacks on the American press, largely (but not exclusively) from the political right. Thomas Jefferson, once a vocal supporter of newspapers, wrote to a young man during his presidency, "Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle."
But a crucial difference exists between the press in Jefferson's era and the press that Levin harangues today. By the 20th century, the partisan press of Jefferson's era had given way to a media that claimed to be driven by an ideal of objectivity. That premise has been the primary source of credibility for American journalists for most of a century.
Ironically, though, it is this claim to near-scientific neutrality that has opened the American press to attacks from the right for more than 50 years. These attacks, in turn, have provoked a profound crisis of confidence in the system of reporting, one that threatens American democracy today.
Objectivity developed as a professional ideal in American journalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At the time, there was no one "correct" model for journalism. But that began to change in 1896 when Adolph Ochs, who had just acquired the New York Times, declared that the paper would "give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved."
Gradually over the next 50 years, the commercial benefits of not choosing sides became clear (an impartial newspaper could sell subscriptions to Republicans and Democrats alike). This spurred most mainstream outlets - large, general-circulation metropolitan daily newspapers - to embrace the New York Times as a model. Professors in the journalism schools that began popping up in the early 20th century also adopted objectivity as a guide for the new set of professional norms their schools would teach.
By the time that radio, then television news, took hold, objectivity had become the standard rallying cry, with news anchors such as Walter Cronkite delivering a 22-minute picture of the world "as it was." Cronkite was never really the most trusted man in America, as the historian W. Joseph Campbell has pointed out, but the label stuck in a world where objectivity was the gold standard.
At the same time, the makeup of American newsrooms was changing. Before World War II, reporters were far likelier to have come from working-class families, making their way up through the newsroom ranks, though the top editors and publishers were generally college graduates. After the war, this began to change, and by the end of the 1960s, young reporters who had been in college during the social upheavals of that decade began to chafe against the strict definitions of objectivity imposed by older editors.
This frustration reflected a more general distrust of institutional authority. At the New York Times, David Halberstam challenged the statements of American generals in Vietnam and headed into the jungle to see the war for himself. A few years later, his friend J. Anthony Lukas butted heads with editors who would not let him cover the trial of the Chicago Seven - activists who had led protests at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention - as a political show trial and insisted that he treat it as a criminal trial, just like the government said it was.
The 1968 convention itself was a seminal moment that prompted a group of reporters to rethink the norm of objectivity. In a 1970 New York magazine article, the reporter and critic Edwin Diamond wrote that it "made many reflective journalists realize that they did have deep personal points of view," something they should acknowledge.
Vice President Spiro Agnew was among the first national politicians on the right to exploit the division between the mainstream press's pose of objectivity and the clear viewpoints that were shaping journalists' coverage. Part of Agnew's genius was to lump all reporters and news organizations into one vast, undifferentiated "media" that conspired to produce a twisted account of the news that little resembled the world as conservatives viewed it. This portrayal undermined confidence in the press more generally.
Books such as TV Guide writer Edith Efron's "The News Twisters," published in 1971, purported to analyze the leftward lean of the press with a scholarly veneer, and offered support for the administration's move to undercut the media's collective credibility. Dozens of books have followed in their wake.
In 1971, Lukas joined with colleagues to found (MORE), a journalism review that tried to nudge elite news organizations into a new set of practices and values for the press, ones that acknowledged, to some extent, the inherent subjectivity of news reporting. (MORE)'s goal was to leave journalism less susceptible to criticism like Agnew's. Interestingly, the staff of (MORE) included, for a time, the young reporter Brit Hume, who has become an ideological Fox News pundit.
The financial success that newspapers and broadcast television experienced in the 1980s papered over many of the arguments about objectivity that characterized the late 1960s and 1970s. This freed mainstream news organizations to continue the outward pose of neutrality that NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen calls "the view from nowhere" (a term borrowed from philosopher Thomas Nagel).
The failure to rethink this posture proved devastating in the internet era, as local newspapers began to fail and reporters became more concentrated in just a few American cities. This new geography of reporting revealed that the American press really does live in a sort of bubble. Follow some of the best reporters on Twitter today, and it's easy to see how many of them know one another across institutions.
And so the cycle of the early 1970s is repeating itself. Smart but disingenuous critics like Levin - the successors of Agnew - pounce on the gap between purported objectivity and an obvious point of view to provoke a crisis of confidence in American journalism, one from which many of them profit handsomely as conservative media personalities.
But their critique is often overly simplistic. The New York Times and The Washington Post are not liberal equivalents of Fox News. They are not partisan news outlets, nor in the employ of the Democratic Party.
Yet many of their reporters do share a worldview. Most have university educations. Most live in large metropolitan areas on the East Coast, where they ride public transportation with people who aren't like them, where there are large minority populations and LGBTQ neighborhoods and restaurants serving Ethiopian food or regional Chinese - which they can probably get delivered to their apartments at midnight, when they're still working on a story.
In short, the best journalists in the United States are in many ways more elite and more cosmopolitan than the American public in general. That, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. Smart people who are aware of different kinds of life experiences make the best journalists. But that does mean that they have a particular way of seeing the world. And they would be much less susceptible to attacks from the Mark Levins of the world if they abandoned the pose of objectivity that opens them to those attacks.

Queer Cinema Seen As Bridge to Future

Texto completo: For many L.G.B.T.Q. people, June signals rainbows and glitter, but also reflection. With the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the WorldPride festival colliding in New York this Pride Month, it's an especially momentous time to look to the past to consider what Pride means today, and cinema -- long an integral part of queer artistic expression -- can be an important tool. Many of the city's repertory movie theaters have assembled special programs for the occasion, from revivals of "Paris Is Burning" (Film Forum) and "The Queen" (IFC Center) to a series looking at queer cinema before and after Stonewall (Museum of the Moving Image).
As ideas about queerness have expanded, so has our engagement with media that reflect those experiences. Nick McCarthy, the director of programming and operations at NewFest, stressed the value of regular programming and its potential to create community. "It's equally important that the contemporary stories told through queer cinema continue to mirror not just the progress but the evolution of our community," he said by email. While NewFest is best known for its annual film festival, it produces year-round programming, which McCarthy said is "essential to serving the community in order to see themselves reflected on screen."
[The New York Times wants to capture the ever-evolving ways in which we describe ourselves. Tell us who you a re.]
One such program is OutCinema, a three-day event presented in part with NYC Pride. McCarthy also hosts a monthly screening and talkback series at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center, as well as a monthly retrospective series at the Quad called Coming Out Again (which will be screening "Gay USA" on June 26).
One of the challenges in creating this programming is the looming threat of streaming services, where a seemingly endless amount of content is always available. The Metrograph is countering that with Films of Pride and Protest, a program of shorts not easily found on digital services. And Adam Baran, who programs the Queer/Art/Film series with the movie director Ira Sachs, said that he suggests alternative titles if a proposed selection is either too present on streaming, or screens in New York too often.
Niche streaming services like Dekkoo offer a home for gay movies, but, as Michael Koresky, the editorial director at Film at Lincoln Center, noted, the quality of their output is inconsistent. "There's a lot of product out there, made cheaply, and, not unlike porn, it's churned out to appeal to a hungry demographic," he said by email.
The major streaming services create an illusion of access and community sans shared physical space; the L.G.B.T. movie sections on Netflix and Hulu might have a handful of gems, but their selection is limited, even as they debut original programming. The alternative streaming platforms for gay cinema have yet to break out, and Baran remarked in a phone interview on the challenges of the market. "It's very hard to know what a gay audience wants, especially a gay audience willing to spend money," he said.
So how important is it for gay audiences to be able to gather together -- in person -- to view these films? Will gay audiences spend money on these specialty repertory programs, like the German-focused Queer Kino at the Quad or the tongue-in-cheek presentation of "The Babadook," whose horror villain was memed into a gay icon across social media in 2017, at IFC Center? Will they be drawn to Koresky's salon-like panel "Queer & Now & Then" to catalyze them to consider past, present and futures of queerness and cinema? "It needs to be encouraged in our community to actively have these dialogues in person to strengthen the fabric, identity, and impact of our community's ethos," McCarthy noted.
In addition to providing tangible community, programmers -- with goals both political and artistic -- hope to give audiences new ways to look at queer subjects. D'Angelo Madsen Minax, who works with Joey Carducci on a series at Anthology Film Archives called The Cinema of Gender Transgression: Trans Film, said by email of their mission, "The programming doesn't only show films by trans filmmakers, or only films about trans subjects or the experiences of trans characters, but tries to imagine what a trans lens can bring to films that more loosely explore trans-adjacent themes." Carducci added, "I think it's crucially important to make space for this kind of work, now and always."
Stonewall 50 and WorldPride provide great reasons to honor queer legacies, but they're hardly the end point for keeping queer stories alive, according to Baran, whose series continues this month with a screening of "Death Becomes Her" presented by the choreographer Raja Feather Kelly. In thinking about queer cultural history, he said, "We're all on a continuum and we need to understand it, and the only way we can understand it is to seek it out."
And Thomas Beard, a programmer at large for Film at Lincoln Center who organized its 2016 series Queer Cinema Before Stonewall, cautioned against an emphasis on commemorating milestone moments: "There are obviously many crucial episodes in the history of gay and trans liberation that predate Stonewall," he said via email. "Our relationship to the historical past is never as neat as anniversary celebrations like these might suggest." He continued, "the horizon of true liberation still feels quite distant, though we still are struggling toward it."

Texto completo: Sen. Amy Klobuchar is set to take the stage on the first night of Democratic debates — but not with Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Kamala Harris.
Instead, the two night event will split the candidates into two groups on June 26 and 27, randomly determined by the Democratic National Committee. The schedule for night one, according to the New York Times, is as follows:
* Cory Booker, New Jersey senator
* Julián Castro, former secretary of Housing and Urban Development
* Bill de Blasio, New York mayor
* John Delaney, former U.S. representative from Maryland
* Tulsi Gabbard, U.S. representative from Hawaii
* Jay Inslee, Washington governor
* Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota senator
* Beto O’Rourke, former U.S. representative from Texas
* Tim Ryan, U.S. representative from Ohio
* Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator
The two-night event is being hosted on by NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo, and will be held at the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Miami. Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie, Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow and José Diaz-Balart will moderate the debates.
Both debates will air live and be streamed on the network’s digital services, including NBCNews.com and MSNBC.com, from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m EST.
The second night will feature:
* Michael Bennet, Colorado senator
* Joe Biden, former vice president
* Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind.
* Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator
* Kamala Harris, California senator
* John Hickenlooper, former governor of Colorado
* Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator
* Eric Swalwell, California U.S. representative
* Marianne Williamson, self-help author
* Andrew Yang, former tech executive
Three candidates who have received attention on the trail did not make it to the first debate stage: Montana Governor Steve Bullock, Massachusetts Congressman Seth Moulton; and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam. Candidates could qualify for the debate in two ways: either by earning at least 1 percent support in three DNC-approved polls or having at least 65,000 unique donors, with a minimum of 200 different donors in at least 20 states.

Texto completo: As New York’s rent control laws approach their sunset date this weekend, New York Democrats are working to pass a new bill with even more restrictions. Proponents claim to be helping the poor, but their new bill will decrease housing availability, decrease housing quality, and force New Yorkers onto the streets while making it look like it's all the private sector’s fault.
Maybe that's even the point.
Rent regulation laws can be a bit confusing. “Rent regulation” is an umbrella term under which there are two types of laws: rent control laws and rent stabilization laws. Rent control laws only apply to people whose families have occupied an old apartment for several decades. In all, only 22,000 New Yorkers fit into that category, according to the New York City Rent Guidelines Board.
However, rent stabilization laws apply to nearly all apartment buildings of six or more units built between Feb. 1, 1947, and Jan. 1, 1974. Nearly one million New Yorkers live in such apartments, so rent stabilization laws are much more relevant.
As of Jan. 1 2019, rent stabilization laws apply to apartments with rent under $2,774.76. According to 2018 data from the New York City government, this accounts for the majority of rented apartments in the area. The landlords of these apartments are subject to government regulations, which will be even more numerous if the new rent regulation bill becomes law.
Under rent stabilization, the government sets the amount by which landlords can raise rent each year. Under current rent stabilization laws, landlords can also raise the rent an additional 6% in order to make property improvements that “directly or indirectly” benefit all tenants, such as a new boiler. But according to The New York Times, that number will decrease to 2% in the new bill. In other words, the already limited incentive for landlords to improve the quality of their properties will become almost nonexistent, and the quality of housing in New York will decline as a result.
When a landlord has a vacancy, he can raise the rent for that unit by as much as 20% under current law. This affords landlords an opportunity to boost the price of certain units above the rent regulation range and to test the market. According to the New York City government, “Since 1994, at least 155,664 units were registered with [Homes and Community Renewal] as being deregulated due to High-Rent Vacancy Deregulation.” Liberals want to put an end to this practice, and to that end their bill abolishes rent increases between tenants.
And it gets worse. Under current law, rent stabilized units can be deregulated if the tenant’s income exceeds $200,000 for two years in a row. This lets landlords test the free market and build a financial cushion without having to raise the prices on low-income tenants. Unfortunately, this path to deregulation will also be eliminated under the new bill. How this handout to top earners advances the alleged goal of helping the working class is hard to fathom.
New York’s new rent regulation bill will decrease housing availability by forcing landlords out of business. It will also encourage them to skimp on maintenance. But most of all, it will encourage condo conversions and prevent anyone with business sense from building new housing below the luxury threshold.
The bill is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and it won’t just blow down one or two houses. It will destroy the entire housing market in America’s biggest city.

Oberlin College's bad day in court

Texto completo: For those who despair that the rule of law in America is being crushed by liberal fake news, we have encouraging news out of Ohio.
A jury has ruled that Oberlin College, one of the nation's most left-wing institutions of higher learning, must pay the proprietors of Gibson's Bakery in Oberlin, Ohio, $11.2 million in damages for libel, slander and other disruptions that the college caused in the business by encouraging false charges of racism.
The day after the 2016 presidential election, an Oberlin student entered Gibson's Bakery, near the college campus, and slipped a bottle of wine into his coat.
Allyn Gibson, whose great-great-grandfather founded the business, told the young man that he was going to call the police. When he took out his phone to photograph him, the youth slapped the phone out of Gibson's hand and ran out of the store, with Gibson in pursuit.
When the police arrived on the scene, Gibson, who is white, was on his back being beaten by the youth and two of his friends, all of whom are black.
Nine months later, the three youths pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and read a statement saying that Gibson's behavior was justified and not racially motivated.
But in the interim, student protests were held outside Gibson's store, and pamphlets were distributed accusing the store of racism.
The school's dean of students was present at these protests. She claims she was there to supervise, not to protest. However, it was reported that she, too, distributed the pamphlet.
The school canceled business with the bakery, resuming again later.
The college administration claims that it cannot control the free speech of its students and that damages caused by students cannot be ascribed to the college.
The New York Times quotes famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams saying, "The notion that uninhibited student speech can lead to vast financial liability for the universities at which it occurs threatens both the viability of educational institutions and ultimately the free speech of their students ..."
The college administration wants us to believe it was doing what so many schools on the left have been criticized for not doing: protecting free speech.
But is this really what was going on?
After the incident occurred and the perpetrators charged and arrested, Oberlin's president and its dean of students sent out an email to the student body saying: "This has been a difficult few days for our community, not simply because of the events at Gibson's bakery, but because of the fears and concerns that many are feeling in response to the outcome of the presidential election. We write foremost to acknowledge the pain and sadness that many of you are experiencing. We want you to know that the administration, faculty, and staff are here to support you as we work through this moment together."
Clearly, the college administration has a political agenda that it is not afraid to convey to its students.
This agenda encourages, explicitly or implicitly, student behavior — inspired by this left-wing agenda — to which school administrators clearly are sympathetic.
When students initiate acts consistent with this, is this called protecting free speech?
A real environment in which free speech is encouraged is an environment of neutrality and intellectual humility, in which there is conviction that there is truth to be discovered, and that it is vital to hear all points of view in order to approach that truth.
This is not what is going on at Oberlin or at other similar highly politicized left-wing colleges and universities.
They indoctrinate rather than teach, and they inspire intolerance rather than understanding.
And thus, people get hurt. Like the proprietors of Gibson's Bakery.
Oberlin College is paying the price now, as it should.
Maybe, hopefully, this will encourage the real thought, intellectual responsibility and free speech so woefully absent there and at other colleges and universities.

Flood center marks 10 years

Texto completo: It was on Friday, June 13, 2008 when floodwaters rose past the banks of the Iowa River, creating the fifth-most costly national disaster in U.S. history at the time, with FEMA estimating the total damage at $750 million. Eleven years later, both Iowa City and the university are still only now beginning to fully recover from the devastation.
On this inauspicious anniversary, the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) — an organization created as a direct result of the 2008 flood — celebrated its 10 year anniversary. The day-long celebration on Thursday featured a smattering of speakers including University of Iowa architect Rodney Lehnertz, former Iowa Homeland Security Emergency Management Director Mark Schouten and Iowa State Senator Rob Hogg.
"The reality is we've had an increase in precipitation in this state state, and an even bigger increase in extreme precipitation," Hogg said. "I believe that's because of climate change."
As climate change promises to increase the number of floods Iowans must withstand, IFC has helped the UI create a campus more prepared to deal with a flooded Iowa River than it was in 2008. They've been successful enough so far that IFC and the flood of 2008 were the topic of a New York Times article earlier this year.
During a partial tour of campus lead by Jeff Harney, assistant director for UI Facility Management, he showed off different aspects of campus architecture and design made to accommodate future flooding.
While locations like Hancher Auditorium and the Voxman Music building had to be rebuilt in more elevated locations, other edifices such as the Department of Theater Arts and the old Stanley Museum at 150 Riverside will remain where they are and rely on flood prevention measures such as pumps, underground valves and Hesco Barriers.
"We keep about 37,000 lineal feet of those (Hesco) barriers on hand at all times," said Harney. "The reason we do that is we can react reasonably quickly, get those in place and get them filled."
Using the flood monitoring technology IFC has developed, the university has more forewarning and more time to now respond to the threat. The flood response team trains regularly and says it is prepared to have flood control measures deployed fully across campus inside of a week.
Although Hesco barriers have had a rough spring— having failed in both Davenport and Burlington after weeks-long exposure to strong currents and high water — Harney remains confident in their usefulness.
"We really strongly feel for our application that they work very well," Harney said, pointing out that sidewalks on the west side of campus allowed space for them to be set two barriers deep.
There are other flood prevention initiatives that leaders believe make the city and university more prepared than they were 11 years ago. Recently, after the announcement of Hancher's Big Splash event coming next year, City Manager Geoff Fruin lamented that Iowa city had turned its back on the Iowa River for several decades and expressed a desire to exist harmoniously with the river.
IFC's efforts has not only helped to prevent damage in Johnson County with things like stream sensors along the Iowa River, developing flood plain maps and the Iowa Flood Information System.
One of the dozens present at the celebration was Laura Jackson, a faculty member at the University of Northern Iowa.
She's a member of the Tallgrass Prairie Center, an organization dedicated to "restoring native vegetation for the benefit of society and the environment," which has partnered with IFC.
"The interesting thing they've pointed out about the flooding, it's always flooding somewhere but then it goes away," Jackson said. "You have kind of a crisis and you deal with it and then another area has a crisis and they deal with it, but what the Flood Center has done is talk about flooding at large and then that way you can look at it more as a whole system rather than (in terms of a specific place.)"
On a national level, Harney mentioned places such as Peoria and Louisville, which have recently contacted IFC for help with flood plans.
"Folks ask us about how we assemble our systems, about how our programs work," Harney said. "So we definitely share information in and around the nation as well."
Lehnartz mentioned that officials at Ohio State asked for advice on how best to prepare the Ames campus for future floods.
"We don't tell them how to beat us in football," Lehnartz said, "but we will tell them how to protect against flooding."

House blocks plan to end government fetal tissue research

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The House voted Thursday to block the Trump administration's move to end human fetal tissue research by government scientists, a direct challenge to the White House that will be tested in the Republican-led Senate.
Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, cochairman of the House Progressives Caucus, sponsored the amendment to a sweeping spending bill. The amendment targets President Trump's policy requiring federally funded research using fetal tissue from elective abortions to undergo separate screenings by an ethics advisory board. Pocan's measure restricted funding to set up such panels.
The amendment passed 225-193, largely along party lines with all Republicans and three antiabortion Democrats — Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, Ben McAdams of Utah, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota — voting against it.
The president reportedly had his political base in mind when he made the decision on June 5 to restrict federal funding for fetal tissue research, ignoring pushback from health and science aides in the administration who argued the importance of such research, The Washington Post reported.
"The administration's decision to forgo to develop treatments, cures for diseases, Alzheimer's, ALS, Parkinson's — this is once again putting personal ideology ahead of public health," Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said on the House floor.
Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland, challenged that even if some research "might benefit from fetal tissue" that doesn't mean the ethics shouldn't be considered.

Video shows Biden's 2006 views on abortion
In a newly unearthed video from 2006, Joe Biden said he supported Roe v. Wade but did not view abortion as “a choice and a right" — remarks that raise further questions about how he views abortion rights as he runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and faces pressure over his position on the issue.
“I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy," Biden said in a videotaped interview with Texas Monthly, reported Thursday by CNN. “I think it should be rare and safe," he added. “I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions."
Biden referred to himself as a “little bit of an odd man out in my party" because he wouldn't vote for federal financing of abortions and had voted to limit late-term abortions, but supported Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the legal right to the procedure.
Last Wednesday, Biden's staff said he maintained his longstanding position in support of the Hyde Amendment. The provision bans federal funding for abortion in most cases, meaning the procedure is available only to women with private insurance and those who can afford it.
The next day, faced with mounting backlash from the Democratic base and his primary opponents, Biden announced he had reversed that position.
New York Times
Trump shows off color changes for Air Force One
President Trump shared mock-ups of an Air Force One with a new paint scheme — featuring colors remarkably similar to those on his private jet — on a television interview broadcast Thursday as Democratic lawmakers moved to impede such a change.
The mock-ups swap out the current sky blue and white for a color scheme that includes red, white, and navy, in nearly identical shades that appear on the jet that Trump used to fly around the country during his 2016 campaign.
The interview, conducted in the Oval Office, was broadcast a day after a House committee voted to require congressional approval for changes to the Air Force One paint scheme and interior design. It's unclear whether the provision will remain in the bill by the time it gets to Trump's desk.
Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee voiced concerns about the potential cost of any changes and said they were hesitant to abandon an iconic design that emerged during the tenure of President John F. Kennedy.
Republicans said Democrats were taking a partisan shot at Trump.

Trump Jr. to get involved in Michigan primary
WASHINGTON — President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., signaled Thursday that he plans to campaign for a primary challenger to Justin Amash of Michigan, the sole Republican congressman who has called for the president's impeachment.
"See you soon Justin," Trump Jr. said in a morning tweet. "I hear Michigan is beautiful during primary season."
Attached to his tweet were poll results showing Amash trailing Jim Lower, a state lawmaker who announced last month that he would mount a primary challenge to Amash in Michigan's Third Congressional District.
Trump Jr.'s tweet fueled speculation that the president would also become actively involved in trying to topple Amash.
Amash became a pariah among fellow House Republicans after declaring last month that President Trump had engaged in "impeachable conduct" that was detailed in the report of now-former special counsel Robert Mueller.
Roughly 60 Democrats have called for launching impeachment proceedings against Trump, with most pointing to episodes of possible obstruction of Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference in 2016.
At a recent town hall meeting in Grand Rapids, Mich., Amash said Congress "has a duty to keep the president in check."
"I'd do it whether it was a Republican president or a Democratic president," he said. "It doesn't matter. You elected me to represent all of you."
Amash responded later Thursday to Trump Jr.'s vow to visit during primary season, writing on Twitter: "if it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer."
That was a reference to Trump Jr.'s role in setting up a meeting in Trump Tower with Russians purportedly to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Cages with mannequins pop up around city

Texto completo: Two dozen cages holding child and infant mannequins peppered the streets and public areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn on Wednesday as part of a political campaign called #NoKidsInCages, created by immigration advocates and a partnering advertising agency with the hope of abolishing family separations at the United States border with Mexico.
The lifelike installations were placed at - and later removed from - at least eight locations, according to the NYPD, including areas near the Manhattan offices of The New York Times, Fox News and CNN. Other sites included the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West Side, and the lower Manhattan entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge, which draws an onslaught of tourists in the summertime. 
The cages were equipped with audio recordings obtained by ProPublica in 2018 that captured the cries of children living in a real detention camp along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to RAICES, one of the groups behind the effort. 
Texas-based RAICES, the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, which provides legal counsel to immigrants at little-to-no cost, partnered with advertising agency Badger & Winters to bring attention to family separations at the southern border following President Donald Trump's implementation of a "zero-tolerance policy" for migrants entering the country illegally. Images of young children separated from their mothers under the since-rescinded policy prompted national backlash, including a legislative proposal to permanently bar the practice introduced by Rep. Jerrold D. Nadler (D-N.Y.) in January.
The legislation has not come to a vote in the House, though Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced a similar bill in the Senate in June with 31 co-sponsors.
The NYPD did not comment Wednesday on whether the 16 other locations provided in a list by RAICES and Badger & Winters had been investigated.
Trump's immigration policy, announced in April 2018 and reversed two months later, separated thousands of migrant children from their families after they made their way to the border. The Trump administration said in April that it could take up to two years to identify all the separated children, of whom a potential 2,654 minors were identified by the government in court documents last October in a case brought by the American Civil

Texto completo: For those who despair that the rule of law in America is being crushed by liberal fake news, we have encouraging news out of Ohio. A jury has ruled Oberlin College, one of the nation's most left-wing
institutions of higher learning, must pay the proprietors of Gibson's Bakery in Oberlin, Ohio, $11.2 million in
damages for libel and other disruptions the college caused by encouraging false charges of racism.
The day after the 2016 presidential election, an Oberlin student entered Gibson's Bakery, near the college campus, and slipped a bottle of wine into his coat.
Allyn Gibson told the young man that he was going to call the police. When he took out his phone to photograph him, the youth slapped the phone out of Gibson's hand and ran out of the store, with Gibson in pursuit.
When the police arrived on the scene, Gibson, who is white, was on his back being beaten by the youth and two of his friends, all of whom are black. Nine months later, the three youths pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and read a statement saying that Gibson's behavior was justified and not racially motivated.
But in the interim, student protests were held outside
Gibson's store and pamphlets were distributed accusing the store of racism. The school's dean of students was present at these protests. She claims she was there to supervise. However, it was reported that she, too, distributed the pamphlet.
The school canceled business with the bakery, resuming again later.
The college administration claims that it cannot control the free speech of its students and that damages caused by students cannot be ascribed to the college.
The New York Times quotes famed First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams saying, "The notion that uninhibited student speech can lead to vast financial liability for the universities at which it occurs threatens both the viability of educational institutions and ultimately the free speech of their students."
The college administration wants us to believe it was doing what so many schools on the left have been criticized for not doing: protecting free speech. But is this really what was going on?
After the incident occurred and the perpetrators were charged and arrested, Oberlin's president and its dean of students sent out an email to the student body saying: "This has been a difficult few days for our community, not simply because of the events at Gibson's bakery, but because of the fears and concerns that many are feeling in response to the outcome of the presidential election. We write foremost to acknowledge the pain and sadness that many of you are experiencing. We want you to know that the administration, faculty, and staff are here to support you as we work through this moment together."
Clearly, the college administration has a political agenda that it is not afraid to convey to its students. This agenda encourages student behavior - inspired by this left-wing agenda - to which school administrators clearly are sympathetic.
When students initiate acts consistent with this, are schools truly protecting free speech?
An environment in which free speech is encouraged is one of neutrality and intellectual humility. This is not what is going on at Oberlin nor at other similar politicized left-leaning colleges and universities.
They indoctrinate rather than teach, and they inspire intolerance rather than understanding. And thus, people get hurt.
Oberlin College is paying the price now, as it should.
Hopefully, this will encourage the thought, intellectual responsibility and free speech so woefully absent at left-wing colleges and universities.

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jodi Rudoren, associate managing editor for audience, discussed the tech she's using.
Tell us a bit about your role as head of audience strategy.
It's a new role, and in many ways, we're making it up as we go along.
The mission is to get more people to read more of The Times. To get addicted to our journalism. To make it part of their daily lives. And to do that, we need to make the journalism work better for more people -- which doesn't mean changing our core values, but does mean reconsidering and reimagining how, when and where we tell stories.
The journalism itself is our strongest audience tool -- we want storytelling that meets readers needs, wows them and is so compelling, so essential, so helpful, so excellent that they make it a daily habit. To get there, we need to help our journalists think more about the audience and read the data signals about what readers want to help inform coverage decisions. Ultimately, it's about building relationships.
That's the 30,000-foot view. Closer to the ground, I'm overseeing our portfolio of newsletters, one of the most powerful ways to reach new readers and keep them coming back, as well as our Reader Center, where we showcase who we are and what we do, engage our critics and elevate reader voices around the news of the day.
I also lead special initiatives to expand and engage our readership in California and outside the United States, and to better serve women. Audience Strategy also includes our amazing and growing Search team, which is all about optimizing journalism's largest channel, and Off-Platform Initiatives, where we look for new opportunities to reach people.
What tech tools are most important for doing your job?
Does Google Calendar count as a tech tool? It's embarrassing, but my job is a somewhat endless series of meetings, so I live by that thing.
People are often shocked that I keep my calendar open. It's part of my life philosophy of radical transparency, which is sometimes called "oversharing." I once accidentally put my 5:30 a.m. spin class on a group calendar -- at least it was a workout and not an appointment with a doctor for some rare skin disorder!
The other thing I can't live without is my iPad Bluetooth keyboard by Logitech. It's with me at breakfast, on the train to work, in all those meetings; I once was overheard typing on it in the women's bathroom.
How do we use tech or data at The Times to determine which audiences we are underserving and then try to serve them?
We use a combination of data and surveys to find gaps and opportunities. Looking at IP addresses helped us realize that we had large and fast-growing audiences in California and outside the United States, especially in Canada and Australia. But we also saw that they read less deeply or frequently than people closer to our New York headquarters, so we stood up teams to lean into those audiences and make it more clear that The Times is for them.
Google Analytics and reader interviews revealed an engagement gap with women, which led us to create the Gender Initiative. One of the things that group does is look closely at which types of stories perform well with women (personal narrative, visual stories, things with a conversational tone) and which do not (data-heavy analysis). We surface these insights to reporters and editors to help guide their decisions about the best way to tell each tale.
We also spend a lot of energy looking at search trends to make sure our report is answering the questions readers ask most and publishing stories when people are hungriest for them. These are people searching for news! They're our people. They just don't all know it yet.
A lot of this is still a work in progress, and maybe it will always be, because our industry, and technology, are changing so much so fast. What's critical, I think, is pretty much the same thing that was critical in my prior roles as reporter and editor -- that I know enough to ask the next best question.
What are some of your favorite examples of how The Times is using tech to attract new audiences?
The Daily has to be the single best example of us not just reaching a whole new cadre of people but really becoming part of their lives: something like one million people a month listen to at least half the episodes. The magic of the show grew out of a profoundly simple question: What does The Times sound like?
What has been transformative is not just the tech -- audio/podcast versus articles -- but the whole approach of combining the story itself and the story behind the story into one irresistible thing. It's barely two years old, but I can hardly imagine a Times (or even a world?) without it.
All new storytelling forms excite me. Data visualizations like this piece about race and income-mobility are mind-blowing in their ability to explain complicated topics. What we call tap-throughs, which generally combine video, stills and text in an immersive way, add multiple dimensions to our reporting and reporters and are unforgettable. Here's one I loved on the border of China and North Korea.
In that same vein, Our Open Source forensic-video investigations are groundbreaking -- a piece on the Gaza fence protests was so much more powerful than anything I wrote (or read) about the two wars with Israel that I covered there.
And some of this doesn't depend at all on tech. I'm a big fan of the "What we know and don't know" form, which we deploy at big news moments to help readers catch up and cut through to get the essentials before diving into some of the deeper stories. These are just words arranged in a way that's different from a traditional news story, plus a few bullets. Hey, this Q. and A. is a new story form, too!
Outside of work, what tech product are you obsessed with?
I'll tell you the tech product I'm obsessed with not having: a search feature that scans all the streaming services on my Apple TV to quickly find where the show I want lives or what my options for watching a particular movie are. There should be an app for that!
I'm entirely dependent on Waze and Google maps. My 11-year-old daughter recently mused that she hopes that someday soon, everybody will somehow have these programmed into the brain and know how to get everywhere. I tried to explain to her that when I was growing up, you had to call and ask for directions, and that a lot of people -- including my mom -- mostly would drive only to places that they were confident they knew how to get to, and how small that made the world.
We also love to hate Alexa. She has helped cultivate an appreciation for '80s music in my kids, who also suddenly have frequent needs for setting timers. Maybe my favorite moment was when my son, who is also 11, said, "Alexa, get me a girlfriend," and she responded, "I'm sorry, I can only reorder items you have already purchased on Amazon."
You're a big cook. What's your favorite kitchen gadget, and why?
A real chef would offer a paean to a humble knife here. I am not a real chef.
I have more high-tech stuff than I need, definitely. I really like my Air Fryer, which is basically just an extra-hot and fast oven. I make eggplant in there and drown it with a quick sauce of cherry tomatoes, garlic and basil, very healthy and yummy in about 20 minutes.
My newest toy is the Whynter ICM-15LS ice cream maker, which could not be simpler. We made a coffee ice cream spiced with coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and chili that was divine (and decaf!), and just did a smooth-as-silk mango sorbet. The problem with having a great ice cream maker is having great ice cream around all the time.
But all of this is really windup. My favorite kitchen tool is completely ridiculous, unnecessary and cheap: the Oxo Good Grips 3-in-1 Avocado Slicer. The thing is a joy-maker. No fear of cutting yourself when you (or one of your kids) hack into the pit, and those even slices are very impressive for plating. I'm not saying it's the first thing I'd take with me to a desert island, but I do like seeing it in my drawer.

Texto completo: It is even more amazing what has been accomplished with the American economy, but Democratic presidential candidates, the media and economists refuse to give President Trump any credit. Recall that it was Paul Krugman of the New York Times, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Trump's election would trigger "a global recession." One continues to wait in vain for an "I was wrong" statement.
The Economist, a center-left British magazine that includes coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that "working people" are still struggling and the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.
The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, "is at odds with reality." The Economist refers to a worldwide "jobs boom" and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that, "Capitalism is improving workers' lot faster than it has in years."
Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says, "Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world."
A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy. Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: "reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work."
This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the "quality" of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, "Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity."
"Reality begs to differ," says the Economist. "Official projections" predict that by 2026, "America will have more at-home careers than secretaries." Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers - and especially younger people - cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements. Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets "lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts." This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.
While acknowledging "The jobs boom will not last forever" and that a recession will eventually "kill it off," the editorial concludes that the economic boom "deserves a little appreciation." It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president.
Republicans and the Trump administration should seize on this reality and promote it every day, asking voters if they want to continue with these successful policies or return to low economic growth and fewer jobs.
It is a question Democrats and their policies of higher taxes and reimposed regulations will find difficult, if not impossible, to answer.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
ROLLING THUNDER REVUE: A BOB DYLAN STORY BY MARTIN SCORSESE Stream on Netflix. As far as adherence to reality goes, Martin Scorsese's new "Bob Dylan story" sits somewhere between Scorsese's 2005 Dylan documentary, "No Direction Home," and "Solo: A Star Wars Story." In other words: It's loose with the facts. There's tour footage shot in 1975 and more recent on-camera interviews with Dylan, Joan Baez, Sam Shepard and other real figures -- the kind of things you'd expect. But there are also some fictional characters mixed in, like a fake filmmaker (played by Martin von Haselberg) who we are told shot the tour footage. (In reality, the footage was shot for Dylan's much-maligned 1978 film, "Renaldo and Clara.") This coloring outside the lines of traditional documentary is fitting for a movie about Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue, a hectic parade through the northeastern United States and Canada that saw Dylan performing in offbeat venues like a mah-jongg parlor in Falmouth, Mass., with a band that included Baez, T Bone Burnett and, eventually, Joni Mitchell.
STEVE JOBS (2015) Stream on HBO platforms; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The announcement by Apple last week that iTunes will be retired may have been the somewhat expected, inevitable product of a culture that has turned to subscription streaming music services. But it also offered a chance to revisit the idea that, with iTunes, Steve Jobs and Apple transformed the way people consumed music. The role Jobs had in changing the way people live with technology (and making tech sexy) through innovations like iTunes has made him a popular subject for films. This movie may be the most wired of them all; it combines Danny Boyle's kinetic directing with a characteristically sharp and fast script by Aaron Sorkin. Michael Fassbender plays Jobs around the launches of three products: the first Macintosh personal computer, the non-Apple NeXT computer and the iMac. The result is "a rich and potent document of the times, an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times.
WONDERS OF THE SEA (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. If you want an undersea adventure that's narrated by a person who might also be able to bench press an anchor, look no further than this nature documentary, which has voice-overs from Arnold Schwarzenegger. (Sorry, David Attenborough.) It follows the famed ocean explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau and Cousteau's children as they go on dives and discuss environmental issues that threaten the ocean.
What's on TV

Texto completo: The benefits of diversity are seemingly everywhere in California. We celebrate different lifestyles, religions, cultures, music, languages, cuisine and geography. The value of diversity can be seen in other ways, too, practical ones such as the popularity of mutual fund investments, eating a balanced diet or making sure an NFL team has a playbook with multiple options.
Everywhere one looks, we see the value of diversifying. If all your eggs are in one basket, you are more vulnerable should something happen to your basket. Diversifying makes obvious sense.
While California needs to harness its sun, wind and water to make us more energy independent, some people are blindly trying to make California 100 percent electric.
Certainly, most people want to continue expanding energy sources that are earth-friendly. But wearing electricity-only blinders is misguided on numerous levels.
Whether transitioning to electric vehicles or “de-carbonizing” buildings, the importance of a multipronged approach to renewable energy has gotten lost or ignored – even energy sources that are renewable, sustainable, and help the environment.
First, relying on a single source of energy is a dangerous proposition. The last time California regulators tried to micromanage the energy market was two decades ago when the state was gripped by a massive energy crisis that brought electrical shortages and skyrocketing consumers prices. Rolling blackouts threw hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses into darkness and zero power.
Second, consider that our electrical grid is computer based. Hackers – inside the U.S. or around the world – pose a serious threat.
Last summer, the New York Times reported that “State-sponsored Russian hackers appear far more interested this year in demonstrating that they can disrupt the American electric utility grid than the midterm elections, according to United States intelligence officials and technology company executives.”
Third, a shift toward a 100-percent electrical society reneges on the promise of building a vibrant and innovative California. There have been incredible innovations involving many different types of energy sources that are already helping California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
Major developments are taking place in the natural gas and propane industries, which has the flexibility to meet the needs of rural Californians. A growing number of California dairy farmers are converting methane into renewable natural gas, which would help California meet its carbon-reduction goals.
An electricity mandate would kill all of these advances.
Fourth, even if demand for electricity explodes, can California realistically provide enough renewable electricity? For the foreseeable future, the answer is no. And according to the Los Angeles Times, new demand will “tax a system already fragile, unstable and increasingly vulnerable to outside forces.”
Fifth, other sources of energy are simply better for the environment and our California lifestyle. Home and professional chefs prefer cooking with gas – as do consumers who grill with propane. Electricity is not exactly portable. How will restaurants and homeowners conveniently provide outdoor heating without tripping over dozens of extension cords?
Consumers also are vehemently opposed to being stripped of energy choice. By a margin of 5 to 1, Californians prefer natural gas for home heating and cooking. And 80 percent of voters oppose laws that would take away their natural gas appliances.
While most people like and appreciate electricity, they cannot and should not have to imagine a world with only one source of energy. Like everything else, energy diversity needs to be celebrated and promoted as a key to a clean and green future.

Kirsten Gillibrand compares judges who don't agree Roe is settled law to racists and anti-Semites

Texto completo: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., says that as president she would impose a pro-Roe v. Wade litmus test on judicial nominees, because anybody who doesn't believe it is settled law is the equivalent of a racist, anti-Semite, or homophobe.
Gillibrand made the comments in an editorial board meeting with the Des Moines Register as Democratic candidates jockey to see who can stake out the most extreme positions on abortion.
"I will only appoint judges and justices that see Roe v Wade as settled precedent, because it is," she said, arguing that it was a matter of "basic human rights."
Asked if such a litmus test was an encroachment on judicial independence, she waved away the idea.
"I think there's some issues that have such moral clarity that we have as a society have decided that the other side is not acceptable," she explained. "Imagine saying that it's okay to appoint a judge who is racist, or anti-Semitic, or homophobic. Asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America I think that we have -- I don't think that those are political issues anymore."
Gillibrand went on to argue that judges who disagreed with Roe were trying to "to impose their faith on Americans," contrary to the "separation of church and state."
She said, "I believe that for all of these issues, they are not issues that there is a fair other side. There's no moral equivalency when you come to racism. And I do not believe there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom."
Funny enough, Gillibrand also slamed Republicans for having "politicized the court" and that it was important to create an independent commission to determine how to de-politicize it.
Gillibrand has been having a hard time staying above zero percent in polls has become increasingly desperate to make her mark in a crowded field. The New York Times recently ran a story musing, "Kirsten Gillibrand Is Struggling. Will Abortion Rights Be Her Rallying Cry?" Now, she's trying to perpetuate the idea that there can be no "other side" in a debate on which the American people have been closely divided for decades.
Full video of the interview here. The discussion of the judiciary starts around the 23 minute mark.

Texto completo: Mientras era trasladado a un hospital en Santo Domingo, República Dominicana , el expelotero de los Medias Rojas, David Ortiz, pidió que no lo dejaran morir.
“Por favor, no me dejen morir. Soy un buen hombre”, clamó el apodado “Big Papi” a personal médico en plena sala de emergencias luego de haber sido baleado por la espalda en el club Dial el domingo.
Uno de los doctores que atendió a la leyenda de las Grandes Ligas en la clínica ofreció el detalle, según citado por el New York Times.
El reporte del NYT también destaca que la noche del incidente, Ortiz no pensaba salir. Sin embargo, decidió acudir al lugar a raíz de una llamada de Jhoel López, un animador de televisión en Dominicana. López también resultó herido, pero se encuentra estable.
“Simplemente salimos y seguimos nuestro camino”, dijo, por su parte, Eloy, hermano de Ortiz. “Esto no hace sentido”, agregó.
El expelotero había viajado a RD para promover una marca de cigarillos y para realizar labores con una fundación para suministar equipo deportivo a niños.
Adicional, el dominicano aprovechó la visita para entrenar con su hijo D’Angelo, de 15 años, quien quiere seguir los pasos de su padre a las Grandes Ligas.
La esposa de Ortiz, Tiffany dijo, en un comunicado de prensa este martes, que su pareja salió bien de la segunda cirugía que se le realizó.
“David llegó al Hospital General de Massachusetts anoche y se sometió a una segunda cirugía exitosa. Está estable, despierto y descansando cómodamente en la UCI, donde se espera que permanezca durante los próximos días”, lee el parte de prensa.
El dominicano fue trasladado desde RD a Boston, hogar del equipo que representó, este lunes para continuar su tratamiento.
La mujer que procreó tres hijos con Ortiz, además, pidió privacidad hasta tanto Big Papi se recupere totalmente.
Reportes extraoficiales que circulan desde este lunes en medios locales e internacionales apuntan a que un narco habría mandado a matar al expelotero por mantener una relación extramarital con su esposa.
Las autoridades aún no han establecido el móvil del crimen.

Texto completo: What's on TV
POSE 10 p.m. on FX. The first season of this drama series transported viewers into the underground ball culture of 1980s New York, set against the backdrop of the AIDS crisis. With the encouragement of the ball master of ceremonies Pray Tell (Billy Porter), Blanca (Mj Rodriguez) broke away from Elektra (Dominique Jackson) and her team, or "house," to form her own, the house of Evangelista. She took in an aspiring model (Indya Moore) and a dancer with showstopping moves (Ryan Jamaal Swain), and her house eventually dominated the competitions. But Blanca's H.I.V. diagnosis lurked beneath that success. Season 2 jumps to 1990: The ball scene, which was founded by L.G.B.T.Q. people of color, has gone mainstream; Blanca tries to balance starting a new business venture with managing her health; and Pray turns to activism to raise awareness about AIDS.

Shot in several countries, the movie spotlights scientists, farmers and researchers who have come up with traditional and innovative solutions to slowing down climate change.
THE BOLD TYPE 8 p.m. on Freeform. Season 3 of this dramedy about the inner workings of a magazine company inspired by Cosmopolitan, comes to a close with Jacqueline (Melora Hardin) considering how to take Scarlet to the next level after Jane's impactful exposé on workplace harassment. And though Jane (Katie Stevens) celebrates a career high at the publication, things aren't so rosy at home. Meanwhile, Sutton (Meghann Fahy) wraps up her design seminar, and Kat (Aisha Dee) finally confronts her problems.
JASPER & ERROL'S FIRST TIME 10:30 p.m. on Viceland. This new series, from one of the creators of "Jackass," follows hosts Davon Wilson (who goes by Jasper) and Errol Chatham as they try to bridge cultural divides by venturing outside their comfort zones. They do so, as the show's title suggests, by trying a number of things for the first time -- including fire-walking, bull-riding and cuddle parties.
What's Streaming
RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET (2018) Stream on Netflix. In this witty follow-up to the 2012 Disney cartoon "Wreck-It Ralph," the eponymous arcade game villain with a big heart (voiced by John C. Reilly) and his best friend Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) leave Litwak's video arcade for the chaotic, overwhelming world of the internet. They initially go online to find a replacement steering wheel for Vanellope's home game, "Sugar Rush." But they quickly get thrown off-course by ads, viral videos and the dark web, and Vanellope discovers a more exciting racing game that may steal her away from Ralph. Their unbreakable bond is the crux of the story, but in his review for The New York Times, Bilge Ebiri wrote that "we might begin to realize that we're watching a terrifying, incisive satire about the ways that a life lived online makes monsters of us all."

Texto completo: FRANKFURT -- Deutsche Bank on Monday acknowledged a lapse in its money laundering controls, underlining the bank's continuing struggle to move beyond a series of scandals that have helped push its stock price to a record low.
An internal audit uncovered deficiencies in the way that the bank processed checks on behalf of clients, Deutsche Bank said in a statement. The audit, which examined the bank's operations in Britain, did not find any cases of money laundering or breaches of international sanctions that occurred because of the lapses, the bank said.
Deutsche Bank issued the statement after The Financial Times reported that checks processed on behalf of three large corporate clients were supposed to be screened by two employees but instead received only a cursory review by one worker.
The bank, which did not deny the report, said it was working to improve its technology to prevent financial crimes. "We continue to invest substantially" in better controls, it said.
Deutsche Bank has repeatedly come under fire for not doing enough to avoid being a conduit for dirty money, and has had a series of embarrassing disclosures about sloppy screening procedures.
Last month, the bank said it had found flaws in software used for years to identify cases of possible money laundering. The bank said no suspicious transactions had slipped through as a result.
In November, German law enforcement authorities searched Deutsche Bank headquarters in Frankfurt as part of an investigation into whether bank employees had helped customers use offshore tax havens to transfer money obtained illegally.
Christian Sewing, the Deutsche Bank chief executive, told shareholders last month that the bank had not found evidence of wrongdoing by its employees.
The New York Times recently reported that anti-money-laundering specialists at the bank recommended in 2016 and 2017 that multiple transactions involving legal entities controlled by Donald J. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, be reported to a federal financial-crime watchdog.
But Deutsche Bank, which has lent billions of dollars to the entities controlled by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner, never filed such reports.
The damage to the bank's reputation, along with meager profits, has shaken investors and helped push Deutsche Bank shares to a record low. The shares closed at 5.97 euros Friday, just 1 cent above the previous record low of 5.96 euros a day earlier. Stock markets in most of Europe were closed Monday for the Pentecost holiday.
The most recent lapses in money-laundering controls were disclosed a few days after Deutsche Bank acknowledged that German prosecutors had widened a long-running tax-fraud investigation to include present and former members of the management board.
Deutsche Bank said in a statement Friday that prosecutors had added the names because the statute of limitations was about to run out. The prosecutors wanted to preserve their ability to pursue other suspects. Deutsche Bank said it "did not participate" in the so-called cum-ex scheme, in which people claimed refunds for dividend taxes they had not paid.
A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to name anyone or comment on news reports that one of them is Garth Ritchie, the head of the investment banking unit.
A spokesman for the state's attorney in Cologne, which is handling the tax fraud investigation, declined to comment.

CEOs sign open letter against abortion bans

Texto completo: More than 180 CEOs signed an open letter opposing state efforts to restrict reproductive rights, as business leaders weigh how to most effectively exert pressure against abortion bans.
Square chief executive and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as well as fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg and others wrote that restrictions on abortion access threaten the economic stability of their employees and customers and make it harder to build a diverse workforce and recruit talent.
The letter, which appeared Monday as a full-page ad in the New York Times, marks the business community's latest foray into a polarizing societal issue. The chief executives of Bloomberg News, Atlantic Records, Yelp and Warby Parker, among others, aligned themselves with such national organizations as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The move also comes nearly four weeks after Alabama signed off on the nation's most restrictive abortion law. Other states, including Georgia, have adopted similar laws.
"As anti-choice politicians are escalating attacks on these fundamental freedoms, we encourage the entire business community to join us in protecting access to reproductive health care in the critical months and years to come," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.
Georgia's law, signed last month by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs near the six-week mark and before many women even know they are pregnant. Alabama banned virtually all abortions in the state - including for victims of rape and incest. Antiabortion supporters expect that the laws will ignite a broader state-by-state strategy to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to take a new look at Roe v. Wade , the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
Several industries have moved to exert pressure on states that limit access to abortion. Some of the biggest names in Hollywood - including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia - have suggested that they might pull their business from Georgia if its new law survives a court challenge. Filmmaking is a $9.5 billion industry in Georgia that created more than 92,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study.
But even among the law's staunch objectors, there isn't a consensus on how companies should respond. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, is urging Hollywood to keep its business in the state, saying a boycott would only strip working-class people of their jobs with no guarantee it would reverse the new law.
She and other business leaders have launched a "#StayAndFight" campaign encouraging Hollywood powerhouses to put their money behind political groups challenging the state's law. Film industry workers are also organizing against any potential boycott and are raising money for a challenge to the law by the ACLU.
Companies that threaten to take their business elsewhere often have the sharpest influence, said Timothy Coombs, a corporate communications expert at Texas A&M University.
"To say, 'Oh, we're going to stay and engage,' that's usually pretty hollow," Coombs said. "To say, 'Okay, we're going to boycott,' companies need to know that most of their stakeholders are going to support that position."

Texto completo: A nonpartisan watchdog group sued the Department of Transportation on Monday for documents related to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.
Restore Public Trust submitted two FOIA requests seeking information related to Chao earlier this year. The DOT acknowledged receiving the requests in April, but it has yet to hand over any documents.
The requests were in response to a New York Times report that disclosed ties between Chao’s family company and her official actions as secretary of transportation.
Chao’s family owns the Foremost Group, an American shipping company headquartered in China. While she holds no formal stake in the company, her high status as a U.S. official and her marriage to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest.
Chao has been accused of attempting to arrange government-funded transportation for relatives, using her status to promote the company, and allowing family members into high-profile meetings that could affect their business interests.
The lawsuit seeks “all correspondence involving certain DOT custodians containing one of a list of search terms relating to the Foremost Group” and “records demonstrating the total costs reimbursed or paid by DOT for travel expenses associated with Secretary Elaine Chao.”
“Americans deserve to know the extent to which Secretary Elaine Chao worked behind the scenes to prop up her family’s company, potentially enriching herself through them at the American taxpayers’ expense,” Kyle Herrig, senior adviser for the organization, said in a statement.
The lawsuit gives the Department of Transportation 20 days from the court order to produce the requested information.

Pressure builds on Hillary Clinton to definitively close door on 2020

Texto completo: With John Kerry taking his name out of consideration for 2020 and the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton’s reasons for waiting to announce whether she plans to run again are running out.
Clinton told friends in January that she was not ready to give up her White House dreams, especially when Mueller had not wrapped up his investigation. She then said in March she said was “not running,” but she planned to keep speaking out. “I’m not going anywhere,” Clinton said.
But after her comments were seen as her closing the door on a third presidential run, a source close to Clinton told New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman the former secretary of state did not mean to be definitive in her remarks.
“The person also says she is extremely unlikely to run, but that she remains bothered that she’s expected to close the door on it when, say, John Kerry isn’t. She has told her team she is waiting at least to see the Mueller report,” the source said.
Tweet
A redacted version of the Mueller report was publicly released in April. Mueller concluded his investigation a month earlier, bringing no new charges, and Attorney General William Barr determined President Trump had not obstructed justice, though Mueller’s report did not exonerate the president.
Clinton suggested weeks later that the 2016 election was “stolen” from her in discussing how she was advising 2020 Democrats.
At this point, however, a Clinton-Trump rematch appears to be a pipe dream.
The Clintons have expressed concern about the number of candidates running. Twenty-three Democratic candidates have announced they are seeking the party’s nomination, the largest field in history. Former President Bill Clinton argued the crowded field makes it harder for a rising star to be noticed.
“The thing that bothers me about having 54 candidates, or however many we’ve got, is someone with rising potential will never hear his or her voice heard,” he said in April.
The former secretary of state warned that the eventual Democratic nominee will need to be able to win both the popular vote and Electoral College, which she was unable to do.

Trump's Ruining Tariffs for Everybody; The silver lining of trade disputes: Democrats going on record against import taxes.

Texto completo: There are many negative consequences to President Donald Trump's tariffs, but one benefit is that they are finally teaching Democrats about tax incidence. Motivated by their hatred of our duly-elected President, a number of party leaders have lately discovered that even if an import tax is formally paid by a business, workers and consumers suffer, too. Perhaps the pols will now also consider the broad economic pain that results from high tax rates on corporate and personal income.
Nobody was happier than your humble correspondent to see that Friday's column was quickly obsoleted by President Donald Trump's wise decision to call off his tequila tax. Now that Mr. Trump has taken yes for an answer from the Mexicans, the mere threat of tariffs will unfortunately continue to be a drag on investment and risk-taking.
But at least politicians on the left are finally helping to make the case against anti-growth policies at the border. Damian Paletta, Taylor Telford and Mary Beth Sheridan correctly reported recently in the Washington Post that tariff costs "are paid by U.S. importers and then often passed along to U.S. consumers." Then they noted a fresh new message from a politician who is normally a reliable voice for bigger government:
Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who is running for president in 2020, said the cost of these tariffs is borne by American consumers, not the countries Trump is seeking to punish.
"This is about taxing American consumers," she said in an interview Friday with Noticias Telemundo. "People are going to have to pay more for washing machines, pay more for clothing, pay more for shampoo. When we look at the trade policy he is conducting in terms of China, now with Mexico, it's going to result in people here paying billions of dollars more a year for consumer products."
Well said, Senator. Here's hoping that Chinese strongman Xi Jinping will agree to stop mistreating U.S. companies and inventors so we can all avoid more trade taxes. If not, it seems that opposition to tariffs may increasingly be a Democratic campaign theme. Last week in the Post, left-leaning columnist Greg Sargent wrote:
In a statement sent to this blog, the Biden campaign sharpened its criticism of Trump on trade, hammering his agenda as "erratic and impulsive," while claiming it's imposing untold "economic pain" on ordinary Americans via a "Trump Tax" and diminishing our country's standing in the world.
On Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said via a press release : "President Trump undermined America's preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south."
On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Gov. Steve Bullock (D., Mont.), who are both running for President, ripped the Trump tariffs in separate appearances on the CBS program, "Face the Nation."
With any luck for U.S. consumers and workers, Democrats running for office will be more reluctant to back tariffs in the future for fear of being labelled as Trump-taxers.
Neil Irwin suggests in the New York Times that the issue is becoming more dangerous for Mr. Trump himself:
In battleground states mostly in the Rust Belt — Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — 39 percent of registered voters said they thought Mr. Trump's trade policies were good for the economy, versus 47 percent who thought they were bad, according to a May Quinnipiac poll.
You can imagine a trade pitch from the 2020 Democratic nominee that goes something like this: "I'll work with allies to keep pressure on China over its unfair practices — but not with open-ended tariffs on thousands of goods that are a tax on American consumers and invite retaliation against American farmers. I won't use tariffs against countries that are our close partners. And I'll use trade policy to try to boost well-being for American workers, rather than using it as a cudgel on unrelated issues."
If Donald Trump can persuade Democrats to abandon tariffs, it would represent a powerful enduring legacy for our 45th President. But the hopeful headline on today's column is perhaps overstating the case.
Some leftists in the Democratic presidential race seem reluctant to rule out taxes of any kind. Lately Sen. Elizabeth Warren, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and his boyhood idol Sen. Bernie Sanders have tended to criticize the way Mr. Trump imposes trade taxes, rather than the existence of them.
But since several of the 2020 candidates really have discovered what tariffs can do to consumers, perhaps they will also consider what a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate has lately done for people seeking work. Sarah Chaney reports today in the Journal:
The number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by the largest margin on record in April, signaling difficulty for employers to find workers in a historically tight market.

Texto completo: I love to travel. I love trying out a new hotel, sleeping in a California king-sized bed and not having to worry about making my bed in the mornings.
The one thing that's always true about traveling is that it costs money. And I'm all about saving money. So, here are my best travel tips to help you keep more of your hard-earned dollars in your pocket:
• If you're flying, travel on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.
These are cheapest days to be in the air. If you can arrange your trip and vacation days to accommodate, you'll save money!
• Avoid baggage fees.
Don't forget that many airlines will charge you to check a bag, which could cost an extra $50 to $100 round-trip per person. So, factor this in when you're shopping for low fares, or just pack more efficiently into a carry-on.
• Don't open a credit card just for the travel points.
Even if you think you're "working the system" and you'll pay if off before it's due, the facts say there's a real chance you won't. One in three Americans are behind on bills. Payments have a tendency to pile up, and they steal more than your paycheck. They steal your joy, too.
• Look into Airbnb.
With Airbnb, you can rent someone's whole house, or even just one room in their house, and many times it's a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel. If you're a real go-getter, try reaching out to the owner directly and make them an offer. The worst they can do is say no!
• Don't take a vacation if you have debt.
I know there's always one reason or another to spend money going somewhere. But if you're in debt, now isn't the time to take elaborate vacations. All your extra money should be going toward building up a starter emergency fund or paying off debt. Trust me, you'll enjoy that beach trip so much more when you have money in the bank, and you paid for it with cash.
For more tips on how to save money traveling, I've got two episodes of The Rachel Cruze Show that will help: Travel Tips That Will Save You Money and How to Go to Disney World Without Debt.
As a #1 New York Times best-selling author, host of The Rachel Cruze Show and The Rachel Cruze Show Podcast, Rachel helps people learn the proper ways to handle money and stay out of debt. She's authored three best-selling books, including Love Your Life, Not Theirs and Smart Money Smart Kids, which she co-wrote with her father, Dave Ramsey.

Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter , a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.
Sheryl Crow, Stevie Nicks and Maren Morris, 'Prove You Wrong'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Here's a big, gleaming bulldozer of a song, built for loudness-wars radio and women's self-sufficiency: "I got my mind made up and my high heels on." It's a Rolling Stones-y stomper from Sheryl Crow's coming album of collaborations, "Threads"; she has said it may be her last full-length album statement in an era of lone songs and playlists. Crow, Maren Morris and Stevie Nicks harmonize to tell some guy that, actually, he's not going to be crushingly missed; Joe Walsh and Vince Gill provide guitars that slide and crunch. It sounds huge and happy. JON PARELES
Avicii featuring Arizona, 'Hold the Line'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"We don't get to die young/We just have to push on," the band Arizona urged in a song that the electronic dance music producer Avicii was working on before his suicide in 2018. The track has the rising, twinkling, intrinsically hopeful keyboard tones that Avicii brought to so many of his productions, but now the song is an elegy. PARELES
Bon Iver, 'Hey, Ma' and 'U (Man Like)'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Bon Iver (Justin Vernon) returns with his unmistakable just-before-dawn textures: hovering electric guitar picking, edgeless synthesizer chords, drums that tentatively arrive and disappear, vocals that cling to to a sturdy, deliberate melody but sound like they're being blurted out -- and what could be more elemental than a refrain of "Hey, Ma"? But introducing this song with a lyric video may not be the best strategy. "Tall vote, you know you mope it up." Huh? PARELES
Raphael Saadiq featuring Rob Bacon, 'Something Keeps Calling'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
With a sluggish, lurching beat and a wash of amorphous guitar chords in the background, Raphael Saadiq captures the desperation of an addiction, the sense of being stuck forever. He sings sweetly about all the things he stands to lose until, just seconds from the end, the harmony changes and he vows, "I'm never turning back." PARELES
Future, 'Love Thy Enemies'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
On the tragic final song on the new Future EP, "Save Me" the Atlanta melancholy and self-destruction specialist sounds spent. Over thickened-up flickers of Iron & Wine-esque guitar, Future rambles about being broken by a failed relationship: "How do I explain this to my children?/I need to find the words without sounding foolish." A moment later, he coughs. Literally coughs. Whether a symbol of unprocessed pain, or of the side effects of the choices one makes to grapple with unprocessed pain, it's a jolt. The more he crumbles, the harder it is to stop listening. JON CARAMANICA
Luke Combs, 'Even Though I'm Leaving'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Luke Combs has one of the most emotionally tactile voices in contemporary country music. Here, he applies it to a classic mid-2000s-style country song in which the main motif changes meaning from one verse to the next -- the father leaves the son as a child, the son leaves the father when he grows up, and then the father dies. Throughout, even at his most tender, Combs is firm, stepping into the rawness of the feeling, not away from it. CARAMANICA
Team Dresch, 'Your Hands My Pockets'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It has been 19 years between new songs for Team Dresch, the Portland punk band that helped establish the subgenre called queercore. The band picks up exactly where it left off in 2000 with "Your Hands My Pockets," a proclamation of woman-on-woman desire set to dense, fast, distorted and ultimately jubilant guitar riffs. A reunion tour starts on Friday. PARELES
Jai Paul, 'He'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Even before a cache of unfinished Jai Paul material leaked in 2013 and became platinum internet samizdat, the innovative and poignant British electronic music producer and vocalist wasn't much for the spotlight. His catalog was slim but influential, and beyond that he was a cipher. In the six years since the leak, he's largely been quiet, apart from beginning an institute to nurture other musicians. But this week, he picked up where he left off. Or more precisely, where he was left behind. He formally released the stolen demos (sans a few samples) as "Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)," and also put out two new songs, finished-up versions of music from the same time period as the leak. Of the two, the slithery electro-soul production "He" is the revelation. A student of Prince, and kin to Dev Hynes and Frank Ocean, Jai Paul blends warmth and abstraction, sparseness with absorption. It's music that, six years after it was initially conceived, still somehow sounds like a vision of tomorrow. CARAMANICA
Esperanza Spalding, 'How to (Hair)'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Spalding recently released an expanded edition of her offbeat, intellectual, sensory catharsis of an album, "12 Little Spells," this time with four new "spells." (She doesn't call the pieces on the album songs; each one is aimed at heightening your consciousness about a different part of your own body). The bassist and vocalist released a video this week for one of the new tracks, "How to (Hair)." Over an ambient backing that funnels down into a slow, whorled beat, Spalding contemplates a history of America from the perspective of black hair, not bothering to rhyme or even to keep rhythm. "Whose image have we been made in? Composed for? Orchestrated by?" she asks. Then, defiantly, she asserts the power of song to make sense of a twisted world: "Our principles are the concertmaster." GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Mateo Kingman, 'Tejidos'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mateo Kingman, from Ecuador, raps in Spanish about mystical and carnal merging in "Tejidos" ("Weaves"): "I want to enter your body, your skin/No destination, no rest, just take me." Most of the rhythm comes from plucked harps -- an Andean instrument, both natural and reprocessed as samples -- along with the programmed sounds of trap; the song rides the beat but also floats way above it. PARELES
Chrissie Hynde, 'Meditation on a Pair of Wire-Cutters'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Chrissie Hynde is utterly self-effacing -- a wordless voice briefly appearing in the ensemble -- on this track from her jazz-derived album due in September, "Valve Bone Woe." It's a sinuous Charles Mingus tune that glides above a leaping bass line; the arrangement slips some distorted electric guitar into a dense thicket of winds and percussion, but Mingus's snaking, chromatic melody is the star. PARELES
David Sánchez, 'Fernando's Theme'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Known for infusing Afro-Caribbean tradition into contemporary jazz, the Puerto Rican-born tenor saxophonist David Sánchez typically turns heads with the enormous power and flash-bang fluency of his playing. But another side of his brilliance becomes apparent on "Fernando's Theme," a simple, one-chord piece. Over electric keyboard, piano, bass and hand percussion, he plays in cool, unhurried lines -- halfway doleful, halfway glorious -- communicating strength through subtlety. RUSSONELLO

Trump Claims Secret in Deal With Mexico, Defying News

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump asserted on Sunday that there were secret, undisclosed elements to his new immigration agreement with Mexico as he sought to deflect criticism that he achieved less than he had claimed with his threat to impose punitive tariffs.
Mr. Trump insisted that Mexico had agreed to take significant actions to stem the flow of migrants at the border with the United States that it had not previously taken and that some of them had yet to be revealed. But he vowed to revive his plan to place tariffs on imports if Mexico does not follow through.
"We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico," the president wrote on Twitter. "Importantly, some things not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time."
Mr. Trump's tweets came as he assailed The New York Times over a report that the deal that he announced with such fanfare on Friday night consisted largely of actions that Mexico had previously agreed to take in prior discussions. "Another false report in the Failing @nytimes," Mr. Trump wrote.
The Times issued a statement standing by its article. "We are confident in our reporting, and as with so many other occasions, our stories stand up over time and the president's denials of them do not," the statement said.
The idea that the agreement included secret provisions could once again roil relations between the two countries, which have been fraught since Mr. Trump took office. Angry that the number of apprehensions at the border has soared to the highest level in 13 years, Mr. Trump threatened at the end of May to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports starting on Monday and escalating up to 25 percent. He called off the tariffs on Friday night after securing the agreement by Mexico to do more to stop the flow.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico was already under pressure at home not to cave in to what critics called the bullying tactics of a bombastic American leader. As it was, some critics were accusing him of building Mr. Trump's border wall but on Mexico's own southern border with its own troops. The suggestion that Mr. López Obrador made additional concessions that have not been disclosed could increase domestic pressure on his government.
Mr. Trump did not elaborate on what secret provisions he was referring to, and the White House did not respond to requests for clarification on Sunday. He may have been hinting at a "safe third country" treaty that the administration has long sought but failed to secure with Mexico.
Under such a treaty, migrants entering Mexico would have to apply for asylum there. The United States would then have the legal ability to reject asylum seekers who tried to enter the country if they had not sought refuge in Mexico first.
But officials from both countries said the two sides reached no commitment on such a treaty, and they said the provisions that were included in the deal were essentially reaffirmations of actions Mexico had already agreed to in previous discussions. American officials argued privately that the value of the agreement may be greater dedication by Mexico to actually follow through on such commitments to avoid another threat of tariffs by Mr. Trump.
Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, said the agreement did advance Mexico's commitment to fighting border crossings beyond previous discussions, citing in particular a promise to deploy a newly formed national guard to its own southern border as well as elsewhere in the country.
"All of it is new," Mr. McAleenan said on "Fox News Sunday." "I mean, we've heard commitments before from Mexico to do more on their southern border. The last time they deployed down there is about four or five hundred officers. This is more than a tenfold commitment to increase their security in Chiapas. That's where people are entering from Guatemala and southern Mexico."
Mr. McAleenan did not explain Mr. Trump's tweets except to say that the two countries would continue to talk about what they could do to combat illegal immigration. "There are going to be further actions, further dialogue with Mexico in immigration, on how to manage the asylum flow in the region," he said.
While critics questioned the value of the deal after Mr. Trump called off the new tariffs, Mr. McAleenan said the threat made a difference. "People can disagree with the tactics," he said. "Mexico came to the table with real proposals."
But the two sides offered divergent descriptions of what would count as success. Mr. McAleenan said Mexico's actions had to result in "a vast reduction in those numbers" of people crossing the border, which reached a 13-year high in May. But Mexico's ambassador said the goal was to have the numbers "go down like to previous levels that we had maybe last year or in 2018."
Ambassador Martha Bárcena Coqui said Mexico had already been deploying its national guard but would increase it starting on Monday. She described the agreement as less concrete and more of a start to a more precise accord.
"It's a joint declaration of principles, which is the base that gives us the base for the road map that we have to follow in the incoming months on immigration and cooperation on asylum issues and development in Central America," she said on "Face the Nation" on CBS.
She suggested there could be elements that had yet to be publicly disclosed. "I think there are a lot of the details that we discussed during the negotiations and during the conversations that we didn't put in the declaration because this is different -- different paths that we are to follow," she said.
The president's opposition said Mr. Trump had little credibility in claiming a great victory. "In February, @realDonaldTrump declared a bogus emergency to build a wall he said will 'solve' immigration," Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter. "Then he made a bogus tariff threat even GOP in Congress rejected Now he claims a bogus 'deal' Mexico volunteered to do months ago Common thread? All bogus."
In his own tweets on Sunday, Mr. Trump threatened to turn to tariffs again if Mexico did not live up to the agreement and reduce the flow of migrants at the border. He also attacked The Times and CNN for their reporting on the agreement. "The Failing @nytimes, & ratings challenged @CNN, will do anything possible to see our Country fail!" he wrote. "They are truly The Enemy of the People!"
In its statement, The Times responded that "calling the press the enemy is undemocratic and dangerous."
Undaunted, Mr. Trump repeated his claim in another tweet on Sunday evening: "The Failing @nytimes story on Mexico and Illegal Immigration through our Southern Border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue, bad reporting, and the paper is embarrassed by it. The only problem is that they knew it was Fake News before it went out. Corrupt Media!"
Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied stories in The Times that were later confirmed as true. Just last week, he assailed The Times and CNN for reporting that he called Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, "nasty" despite a recording where he was clearly heard using the word. Last year, he posted on Twitter a distorted version of a meeting he had with A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The Times.
Most notably, he tried to get his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, to draft a memo falsely denying a Times report that the president had told him to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, according to the report by Mr. Mueller.

Texto completo: No han pasado dos días desde que se llego a un acuerdo entre México y Estados Unidos para suspender la imposición de los aranceles a los productos mexicanos para que el presidente Donald Trump volviera a amenzar a López Obrador.
“Sin embargo, si por alguna razón desconocida no hay (cooperación por parte de México), siempre podemos volver a nuestra posición anterior, y muy lucrativa, de (amenazar con) Aranceles; pero no creo que eso vaya a ser necesario” , dijo Trump en Twitter al defender el acuerdo pero sin dejar sus amenazas contra el gobierno de AMLO.
En una serie de tuits, Trump defendió el pacto migratorio logrado este viernes con México, por el que él accedió a suspender los aranceles que planeaba imponer a todas las importaciones mexicanas, después de que el diario The New York Times afirmara que algunos puntos se acordaron hace meses.
“Antes, México no estaba cooperando en la frontera, y ahora tengo una confianza completa, especialmente después de hablar ayer con su presidente (Andrés Manuel López Obrador), en que cooperarán mucho y en que quieren hacer bien el trabajo”, escribió Trump.
El mandatario aseguró que “se acordaron algunas cosas que no se anunciaron en el comunicado” del viernes, “una en particular”, y que eso “se anunciará en el momento adecuado”.
La Casa Blanca no dio más detalles sobre cuál podría ser ese acuerdo inédito, y el secretario en funciones de seguridad nacional, Kevin McAleenan, se limitó a recordar que, como se anunció el viernes, está previsto que siga habiendo negociaciones durante los próximos 90 días.
“Hay un mecanismo para asegurarnos de que ellos (México) hacen lo que prometieron hacer, de que hay un resultado y vemos una reducción grande en los números” de inmigrantes que llegan a EEUU, dijo este domingo McAleenan a la cadena de televisión Fox News.
La embajadora de México en Estados Unidos, Martha Bárcena, precisó después que las conversaciones entre los equipos técnicos continuarán “casi semanalmente”, por lo que en el plazo de 90 días podría haber nuevos anuncios.
“(Lo anunciado el viernes) es una declaración conjunta de principios, que nos da una base para la hoja de ruta que tenemos que seguir en los próximos meses en cuanto a migración” , explicó Bárcena en una entrevista con la cadena televisiva CBS News.
Bárcena apuntó que el objetivo es devolver las cifras de migrantes que llegan a EEUU a los niveles de 2018, y pronosticó que habrá “resultados en un plazo relativamente corto, de un mes o mes y medio”, gracias al despliegue de unos 6.000 efectivos de la Guardia Nacional de México en la frontera de ese país con Guatemala.
Pero la embajadora no confirmó que, como parte del acuerdo alcanzado el viernes, México haya “accedido a empezar inmediatamente a comprar grandes cantidades de productos agrícolas” a EE.UU., como aseguró Trump en un tuit este sábado.
“Estoy absolutamente segura de que el comercio en bienes agrícolas podría aumentar drásticamente en los próximos meses”, debido a la combinación de la suspensión de los aranceles y “la ratificación del (acuerdo comercial) T-MEC” en EE.UU., México y Canadá, subrayó Bárcena.
Su entrevistadora le pidió entonces aclarar si estaba hablando de un acuerdo paralelo logrado durante las negociaciones de esta semana, o si simplemente se refería a tendencias comerciales, y Bárcena respondió: “Estoy hablando sobre comercio”.
El pacto anunciado el viernes permitirá la ampliación a toda la frontera común de un programa que el Gobierno ha aplicado hasta ahora solo en tres puntos de entrada en la zona limítrofe, y que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo a esperar en el país vecino mientras se tramitan sus casos en territorio estadounidense.
Ese proceso puede durar meses o incluso años, y este año ya se ha enviado a México a 10,393 solicitantes de asilo en EEUU, según fuentes oficiales mexicanas.
La oposición demócrata ha criticado a Trump por usar la amenaza de aranceles para extraer compromisos de México sobre inmigración, y dos aspirantes presidenciales, Bernie Sanders y Beto O’Rourke, arremetieron este domingo contra el mandatario por su aviso de que, si no hay avances migratorios, volverá a amenazar con aranceles.
“Necesitamos una relación decente con México. Son nuestros aliados, como Canadá. No deberíamos estar enfrentándonos a ellos cada día”, dijo Sanders a la cadena CNN.

Borscht belt rebirth

Texto completo: Don't look now, but we are in a Catskills moment, and this is no summer fling. This moment hopes to live long past Labor Day, powered by two new high-end neighbors that have put the region in the spotlight.
The gleaming $1.2 billion Resorts World Catskills casino just marked its first anniversary (with an appearance by Paul Anka), while the $200 million Kartrite Resort and Indoor Waterpark opened for business in April. Billed as the state's largest water park, the Kartrite has 11 slippery attractions powered by 318,000 gallons of water.
Both are in Sullivan County, New York's Monticello, the dollop of sour cream on the once-thriving Borscht Belt — which for generations was the summer getaway spot for greater New York Jews and stakes a valid claim to being the birthplace of contemporary American comedy.
But this Catskills moment is about more than slot machines and waterslides. And it is serious business for a chronically depressed region hoping to capture some of the old magic.
This latest Catskills moment mixes pop-culture and nostalgia in the age of streaming video, and a pioneering spirit that has artisans and entrepreneurs betting on the region's revival. Foodies have already begun to gravitate to the region's farm-to-table restaurants.
Call it "Borscht Belt 2.0" — soon to be all over Instagram.
'Maisel' tov The Emmy-winning Amazon series "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" tipped its pill-box hat to the Catskills experience in its second season.
In three of its 10 episodes, Midge, played by Rachel Brosnahan, and her family take to the mountains for a month of bungalow life that managed to give the title character, a stand-up comedienne, a shot in the big room at the Catskills' biggest hotel, The Concord.
The wider media is taking note of this Catskills moment, too, with assignment editors sending staffers to check out this boutique hotel or that reimagined town.
Last November, The New York Times chronicled one resident's efforts to revive Mountain Dale, his hometown, by buying up dozens of buildings in the down-on-its-luck hamlet.
The travel website Lonely Planet last fall named the Catskills among its "Best in Travel 2019 Top Regions."
In its list of "10 regions that are ready for the spotlight," Lonely Planet placed the Catskills second only to Piedmont, Italy. That put the once-lowly Catskills ahead of northern Peru, the Red Centre of Australia, and the Scottish Highlands, among others.
Among the region's attractions, the site listed the Woodstock Festival 50th anniversary and "an influx of creative farm-to-table restaurants, bespoke breweries and distilleries, and a growing array of arts collectives."
This is all pretty heady company for the Catskills, whose fortunes plunged when the bottom fell out of the Borscht Belt beginning in the 1970s.
Documenting decay Photographer Marisa Scheinfeld, 38, grew up in Kiamesha Lake, just outside Monticello. One of her first jobs was to lifeguard at The Concord's outdoor pool in what would be its final summer.
She spent much of her childhood watching once-great hotels go under and the bungalow colonies that dotted the landscape shutter. Some were lost to fire; many were left to decay.
Scheinfeld, who now lives in Katonah in Westchester County, left to pursue a photography career, but she returned to the Catskills in 2010 to begin a five-year odyssey, part anthropological, part archaeological, to document what remained decades after the last summer visitors had departed.
Her 2016 book, The Borscht Belt: Revisiting the Remains of America's Jewish Vacationland," (Cornell University Press) captures ghostly images of leisure sites in such utter relaxation that nature has reclaimed them:
A lounge chair at Grossinger's indoor pool sits on a carpet of moss;
Dishes in the kitchen at the Nevele Grande Hotel in Ellenville are stacked, awaiting a dinner rush that will never arrive;
Coffee-counter stools in '50s green and chrome stand silent sentinel, their counter long-since removed.
"It's bittersweet, but it's part of that cycle where you have the Borscht Belt starting up in the '20s, booming in the '50s, declining in the '70s, '80s and '90s, technically, and largely stagnant since that," Scheinfeld said.
"People give the same reasons over and over for why the Borscht Belt died out: air-conditioning, suburbs, air travel, cruise industry; all these things, not just one," she said. "It had its day, it had its moment and that moment passed. Now you have this turning over."
Another Scheinfeld is covering that part of the story.
Jillian Scheinfeld, a New York-based freelance writer, was back in the Catskills this month, working on a magazine piece on the new Catskills. And she wasn't alone. Writers from New York magazine and Black Book magazine were there, too, writing about the long-sought renaissance.
"She said she was from the area and everyone was like 'That's so cool,'" Marisa Scheinfeld said. "Trust me, it was not cool to be from Monticello 20 years ago, but now people are like 'It's so awesome up here.'"
A new wave, and a wave of nostalgia Even at age 70, Phil Brown — now a Northeastern University professor of sociology and health sciences — is still a Catskills kid at heart, having spent summer after summer there. His parents owned Brown's Hotel Royal from 1946 to 1952 and labored for decades at several other hotels.
His mother, Sylvia, was a chef. His father was a maître d' who also ran coffee shops before joining a Monticello employment agency, filling the staffing needs of hotels across the Catskills.
Their son started as a busboy at 13 and worked in the Catskills every summer, through grad school: The Cherry Hill in Greenfield Park; Paul's Hotel in Swan Lake; the Nemerson; Brickman's in South Fallsburg; and the Karmel in Loch Sheldrake, now home to the famed Stage Door Manor theater camp.
Brown has written or edited three books on the region: "Catskill Culture: A Mountain Rat's Memories of the Great Jewish Resort Area" (1998); "In the Catskills: A Century of Jewish Experience in 'The Mountains'" (2002); and "Summer Haven: The Catskills, the Holocaust, and the Literary Imagination," which looked at the Catskills during the Holocaust and its immediate aftermath.
Wish you were here Brown also was key to the start of the Catskills Institute (at https://catskillsinstitute.northeastern.edu/), an annual gathering of academics, history buffs and nostalgic fans of the region created in 1995.
The Institute compiled an archive of ephemera, from menus and postcards to ratecards, a loving chronicle of the time when a big piece of Jewish-American culture and identity took up summer residence not far from Route 17 and within easy reach of even the slimmest wallets.
To stay at The Nemerson, which Brown called "a very fancy place" in South Fallsburg, for the July 4 weekend in 1969, you would have paid — a three-day minimum — from $18 to $33 a person. That price included three meals a day.
"The prices were low and there was something everybody could afford," Brown said.
The Catskills hotels pioneered the all-inclusive vacation, an idea that Caribbean resorts and cruise lines would later adopt to meet the expectations their clientele had developed in the Borscht Belt, Brown said.
The Catskills, he also explained, were a place where American Jews — denied access at many hotels — got to be Americanized while keeping their Jewish culture. The average Jew in the old country did not go on vacations, so the Catskills was part of the success, the upward mobility, Brown said.
Gone for good The new 18-story casino is on land once occupied by The Concord, the largest of the Catskills hotels until it closed in 1998. In its heyday, The Concord had more than 1,500 guest rooms and a main dining hall that could seat 3,000.
The casino boasts 332 suites and 100,000 square feet of gaming action, including an area catering specifically to Asian gaming. It has a spa and will, later this year, rechristen the Concord's famed golf course, redesigned by Rees Jones. (www.rwcatskills.com.)
A development that's a closer cousin to the Borscht Belt, Brown said, is one that speaks the same language: the rise of year-round Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox communities who bought aging and shuttered vacation properties.
Brown said he knows the Borscht Belt is gone for good.
"It spawned lots of books and movies and culture and the culinary culture and the comedy culture. That's a great a great slice of history," he said.

Texto completo: You too can live like a TV icon right in North Jersey.
The home of Tony Soprano recently went on the market with a starting price of $3.4 million, The New York Times reported. Scenes from the first season of "The Sopranos" were filmed at the Aspen Drive house in North Caldwell.
The luxurious home with its long driveway and lush landscaping is reminiscent of Tony Soprano in his bathrobe, feeding ducks by the pool at the beginning of the series.
Victor Recchia and his wife Patricia have lived at the house for years. Now that their son has moved out they don't need as much space they're ready to sell, but will stay in New Jersey, The Times reported.
"For 10 years, it's been a wonderful experience," Patricia Recchia previously said about living there. She enjoyed when people would go by and think, "This looks like the Soprano house."
The Recchias could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
"The Sopranos" pilot was filmed inside and outside of the North Caldwell house, but a replica was built for later seasons.
When James Gandolfini died in 2013, a memorial was set up outside the North Caldwell home. It included a bag of pasta, flowers, candles and cigar placed on the curb.
The house was built in 1987, according to its Zillow listing. It's about 5,600 square feet.
The Recchias are handling the sale themselves. Anyone interested in bidding on the house can email sopranoshouseforsale@gmail.com.

Wells Fargo to Settle
Auto Insurance Lawsuit
Wells Fargo has reached a $ 386 million deal to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by customers who say the bank forced them to buy unnecessary auto insurance, putting to rest one of its many legal problems.
The agreement, described in court papers filed Thursday, would resolve a lawsuit filed in July 2017, shortly after The New York Times published the results of an internal report the bank had commissioned on the matter. The report found Wells Fargo had for years been buying a certain kind of auto insurance from National General Insurance and applying it to auto loan customers' accounts without their knowledge.
Those borrowers were charged interest not just on their loans but on the insurance premiums as well, pushing more than 270,000 of them into delinquency.
Wells Fargo, the nation's fourth-biggest bank, said it had already committed to using most of the settlement amount as part of the plan it developed to repair the damage its customers had suffered under the practice. National General Insurance, which according to the report paid Wells Fargo unearned commissions on the insurance policies, will pay $ 7.5 million as part of the settlement, bringing the total settlement amount to just under $ 400 million.
Wells Fargo said that the settlement was "an important step in making things right for customers." EMILY FLITTER

Facebook Bans Its Apps From New Huawei Phones
Facebook is no longer allowing pre-installation of its apps on Huawei phones, the latest blow for the Chinese tech giant as it struggles to keep its business afloat in the face of a United States ban on its purchase of American parts and software.
Customers who already have Huawei phones will still be able to use its apps and receive updates, Facebook told Reuters. But new Huawei phones will no longer be able to have Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram apps pre-installed.
Smartphone vendors often enter business deals to pre-install popular apps such as Facebook. Apps including Twitter and Booking also come preinstalled on Huawei phones in many markets. Twitter declined to comment and Booking did not respond to a request for comment.
The move by Facebook dampens the sales outlook for Huawei, whose smartphone business became its biggest revenue generator last year, powered by strong growth in Europe and Asia.

Walmart to Restart Grocery Delivery Service
Walmart will restart a service that offers the delivery of groceries directly to shoppers' refrigerators as part of its attempts to find unconventional ways to offer cheap and rapid delivery of online orders.
Walmart initially tested the service in 2017 with the smart-security company August Home and a third-party courier firm, Deliv, which used gig workers to make the deliveries. It ended the test a year later.
This time, Walmart will use its own workers, who have been with the retailer for at least a year, and use its own vehicles. Walmart will also use smart-entry technology and a wearable camera to access shoppers' homes, the company' said, allowing customers to watch remotely.
Starting this fall, the service will be available to over one million customers across three cities: Kansas City, Mo.; Pittsburgh; and Vero Beach, Fla.
Walmart recently launched one-day delivery without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon announced a similar offer. It has also been using several third-party courier firms to make such deliveries. Reuters

Colbert: Trump is ‘trying to cast a spell’ on America

Texto completo: Stephen Colbert, host of “The Late Show” on CBS, said he believes President Trump is confusing voters and distorting reality.
In an interview with the New York Times, the 55-year-old comedian spoke about his show and how it deals with politics and news of the day. Colbert, who focuses much of his attention on Trump during the show, was asked about a “Trump bump” and whether the president has helped catapult him to the highest-rated show in late-night TV.
“It’s almost as if the president is trying to cast a spell to confuse people so they cannot know the true nature of reality, and what we do is pick apart the way in which the [expletive] was sold to you,” Colbert said. “I think that’s why it’s going well. Our job is to identify the [expletive], and there’s never been more.”
Colbert, who said his show offers a “explicative deconstruction of the day’s news,” thinks the heavy mockery of Trump comes as an obligation, given the around-the-clock news coverage of the president.
“Trump consumes the news cycle, and our mandate, as we’ve established for ourselves, is that I want to inform the audience of my opinion about what they’ve been thinking about all day,” he said.
Before moving to CBS in 2015, Colbert was the host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report,” which was a parody of opinion news shows. He played a satirical version of a right-wing pundit.

It's National Doughnut Day, and these area cops have lots of jokes about it

Texto completo: It's National Doughnut Day, and these police officers are embracing the age-old stereotype that cops love doughnuts.
Departments from across the region on Friday tweeted videos and pictures of officers on patrol diving headfirst into the faux food-holiday.
In Hingham, Police Sergeant Steven Dearth shared a short video Friday morning that showed a slew of police cruisers parked outside of a Dunkin' shop in the community.
“No it isn't our new substation," he joked, “it's just #NationalDonutDay."
The department also tweeted from its main account, sharing pictures of several officers lined up for breakfast inside the store (and one behind the counter?).
In Braintree, police joined the Twitter brigade and said the nationwide doughnut celebration was causing some traffic jams locally — at the Dunkin' drive-through windows.
“TRAFFIC ALERT," police tweeted. “We're seeing higher than expected traffic at #Braintree #dunkindonuts especially at drive thrus. Please be patient, we're all in this together."
Like colorful sprinkles, the department topped off its tweet with the following hashtags: #NationalDonutDay #powerrings #copslovedonuts #donutwhattodo #donutemergency.
Police in Methuen also got in on the jokes, tweeting “We know it's cliche, but Happy National Donut Day!"
But all of these tongue-in-cheek messages about cops loving doughnuts brings up one glaring question: Why do they get associated with eating the fried breakfast treats?
According to a 2015 article in Smithsonian magazine, the connection between them seems to date back at least to the 1950s, when doughnut shops “were some of the only snacks available to police" who were on patrol late into the night.
Citing Atlas Obscura and a book called “The Donut: History, Recipes, and Lore from Boston to Berlin," the magazine wrote that because bakeries were typically open after hours — so they could prepare for the crush of people clamoring for coffee and doughnuts the following morning — the shops were ideal locations for officers looking to fuel up or sit down.
In 1996, the New York Times wrote a story about why “cops are so closely associated with doughnuts," calling the food item “a convenience for law enforcement."
Not only that, the Times reported, but it was also why doughnut shops — at least at the time the article was written — had such low crime rates.
“Criminals know better than anyone that sugary doughnuts, along with high-octane coffee, are just what police officers crave on their long, irregular tours of duty to keep awake and function," the article said.

Post-birth depression a real risk mothers face

Texto completo: Having a baby conjures up thoughts of smiles, when seeing a new mother gazing at her child. The idea of that mother becoming depressed related to birth seems inconceivable. Evidence exists that depression and other mood disorders, and even psychosis, can affect some new mothers to the point where the child or her life may be in danger.
According to an article in the New York Times on March 25, 2019, the number may be as high as one in nine American mothers. The authors Elisa Albert and Jennifer Block wrote a thought-provoking piece titled "Can a Drug Stop Post-Partum Depression?" This was on the heels of the Food and Drug Administration approving a new drug, Zulresso, which can be used with quick results at the onset of depression in new mothers. It is controversial because of its high cost and a requirement for the mother to be hospitalized, as it is given intravenously over 60 hours.
Post-partum depression full of complexity The article brought out so many other factors that could contribute to depression, like money issues, lack of support, domestic violence. It is a complex issue, in which the authors of the New York Times article point out that realistic treatment usually involves more than a drug.
May was Maternal Mental Health Month. Carole Sheehan of Tucson said: "Perinatal mood disorders and anxiety are the leading complication of childbirth if measured against other physical risks like gestational diabetes and hypertension." Sheehan, founder of a Post-Partum Depression Coalition in Tucson, said, "20 percent is the average prevalence of perinatal disorders." (Perinatal refers to the period of pregnancy and a year afterward.)
What is post-partum depression? "Baby Blues" is often referred to when mothers become emotional or sad after having a baby.
What are the symptoms? Symptoms of baby blues can vary in intensity and last only a few days to a week or two and may include mood swings, anxiety, sadness and feeling overwhelmed according to the Mayo Clinic.
Post-partum depression may be mistaken for baby blues but symptoms are more intense and last longer — and may eventually interfere with a mother's ability to care for the baby. Symptoms usually develop within the first few weeks after giving birth. Symptoms can also emerge during pregnancy and a year after the birth.
Symptoms can include severe mood swings, excessive crying, withdrawing from family, difficulty bonding, hopelessness and most worrisome — the mother having thoughts of harming herself, or the baby, and possibly thoughts of death or suicide. It is believed that untreated postpartum depression may last for many months or longer.
Post-partum psychosis can include hallucinations, delusions, paranoia and actual attempts to harm the baby. Post-partum psychosis is an emergency. I witnessed a new mother as she became psychotic, and her face is as vivid in my mind today as when I witnessed the change in her emotional state.
It is thought that the dramatic hormonal changes and emotional stresses accompanying childbirth may contribute the onset of post-partum depression. Women with other disorders such as bi-polar or pre-existing depression have an increased risk.
When to seek help Psychiatric intervention is necessary if symptoms of "baby blues" last longer than two weeks, or if the mother is having problems caring for the baby. It is imperative that a mother with psychosis get immediate help. She may not be aware of the severity of the situation and why it can be life threatening. It is important that people around her understand the possible dangers involved.
Postpartum Support International (PSI) is a resource that may have information for finding support and information in a local area. The PSI helpline is 800-944-4773. Also, borderlandpostpartum.blogspot.com/ can be a resource also to find what might be available locally.

A Tradition of Organizing

Texto completo: Headnote When there's a crisis in the community, we help our neighbors. A new movement is bringing back this tradition to address the housing crisis.
As young student activists and organizers in Ohio and Los Angeles in the early 1970s, my parents were a part of a rapidlygrowing movement within the black community that sought to create the kinds of community institutions we knew we needed in order to prosper and thrive.
My dad won a scholarship to the college they attended by writing a play based on race relations - and, after they met, both my parents spent their young adulthood advocating for civil rights and a basic respect for the human dignity ofAfrican Americans and people of color. Their achievements set the tone for my own work as a political organizer and activist for social justice.
The values I hold - fighting for what's right, holding our elected leaders accountable, making sure people find and use their own voices in addressing the systemic problems in our society - come from mom and dad, and from others in my family who heard the call to activism. I'm proud to be walking in their footsteps as a part of the next generation.
But while my parent's political activities may have been seen as radical in their time, today, I'd just call that "being a good neighbor."
And there's no question that, now more than ever, our neighbors need our help. Poverty and homelessness are at record levels among African Americans in California, and many of our longterm neighbors are being pushed out by high rents - all consequences of the severe housing shortage that's crushing our state, from north to south and all points in between.
But like my parents before me, I'm not inclined to sit on the sidelines and watch as my brothers and sisters go through another cycle of gentrification and displacement. It's my commitment to creating equitable communities that led me into the political realm, first as a volunteer leader on the first Obama campaign, then as Operation Vote Director for the 2012 Obama Campaign in Wisconsin, and now as the statewide Director of Organizing for California YIMBY a new, pro-housing group focused on ending the affordable housing crisis and making sure California is affordable for everyone.
Despite our passion and commitment to resolving the housing crisis in all of our communities, we're facing huge headwinds: Many of the wealthy, suburban California communities that put up barriers to inclusion in the 1960s and 1970s have maintained their political influence in our state, and continue to take an exclusionary view of how their communities develop. As the New York Times wrote recently:
There is [a] refusal on the part of wealthy progressives to live by the values they profess to support at the national level. Creating dense, economically and socially diverse urban environments ought to be a paramount goal of progressivism. Cities are the standard geographical unit of the global economy. Dense urban areas are quite literally the "real America" - the cities are where twothirds ofAmericans live, and they account for almost all national economic output. Urban areas are the most environmentally friendly way we know of housing lots of people. We can't solve the climate crisis without vastly improving public transportation and increasing urban density. More than that, metropolises are good for the psyche and the soul; density fosters tolerance, diversity, creativity and progress.
Yet, where progressives argue for openness and inclusion as a cudgel against President Trump, they abandon it on Nob Hill and in Beverly Hills. This explains the opposition to SB 50, which aimed to address the housing shortage in a very straightforward way: by building more housing. The bill would have erased single-family zoning in populous areas near transit locations. Areas zoned for homes housing a handful of people could have been redeveloped to include duplexes and apartment buildings that housed hundreds.
At California YIMBY, we take seriously our state's history of excluding certain types of people - people of color, middle-class and lowincome workers, and immigrants - via apartment bans and other restrictions on building affordable housing, but we're undaunted in facing the challenge. If you look at the scale and scope of the crisis, we don't have much of a choice: In Los Angeles, over 30 percent of people experiencing homelessness are African American - despite making up just 9 percent of the population. In Oakland, the Black population has fallen from its high of 47 percent in 2000 to 31 percent today - a loss of 27,000 African Americans during that time.
My role at California YIMBY (YIMBY stands for "yes in my back yard") gives me the opportunity to engage with Californians across our state, to hear their stories of housing insecurity or even homelessness, and support their efforts to find solutions. I'm blessed to be able to listen to the concerns people have about preserving and protecting their neighborhoods, while engaging in honest conversation about what we need to do to produce the housing that will provide everyone with a home. Sometimes, these conversations are awkward or uncomfortable. But as activists, we're not here to provide cover for the status quo: We're here to foster the kind of changes in society that would advance our values of neighborliness and empowerment, of creating access to opportunity through the most basic vector of access to affordable housing.
My goal is to not just walk in my parent's footsteps, but to move our cause further down the field and advance the good work of folks like my parents and so many of their fellow activists. I'm confident that as we build this movement, we'll become a force for overcoming the barriers - both historic, and from the present-day - to inclusive, diverse, open communities. We really can make California for everyone.
Change is going to come, but to get there, we'll all have to "do the work" - in our communities, but also in our own hearts and minds.

Texto completo: Democrats have grown expert in these Trump days at creating fake scandals. So it's refreshing to read a previously undisclosed email in which Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a presidential aspirant, destroys a leading narrative even as she highlights her own party's excesses.
The "scandal" here involves Twin Metals Minnesota, which holds two mineral leases on government land outside the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the northeastern part of the state. The Interior Department had renewed the leases continuously for decades. But when Twin Metals got serious about a mine, the Obama administration jumped into bed with green activists who ardently opposed it.
In 2014, Interior delayed the renewals, calling for more "study." In early 2016, the department's solicitor issued a howler of a legal opinion, granting the government new authority to deny Twin Metals automatic lease renewals. It was an Obama extralegal classic: The opinion ignored precedent, existing rights and regular procedure. In a midnight kiss to green activists, the department officially blocked the leases on Dec. 15, 2016.
This highly irregular decision was destined to get a fresh look from the Trump team. The new president's appointees at the Interior and Agricultural departments all came to office determined to restore the law and regulatory certainty. In December 2017, the new Interior principal deputy solicitor found the prior opinion fatally flawed and moved to renew Twin Metals' leases. The company moved on to an arduous environmental review, and it could still be blocked by the feds or the state. Beyond some furious greens, that should have been the end of the matter.
Instead, we are in an age where every move by the executive branch is judged not on the policy merits but on a "corruption" scale. Early in 2017, stories started popping up about how Twin Metals was controlled by the family of a Chilean billionaire. And that billionaire also owns a house in Washington, which he rents out to . . . Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Scandal! Payoff! Sleaze!
It didn't matter to critics that the Chilean doesn't know the Trumps, that Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner have never met their landlord, or that they pay a market rent of $15,000 a month. Nor did it matter that the decision was an obvious one for the Trump team to reconsider on the merits, or that the new opinion was rock-solid and corrected a legal embarrassment.
Democrats and activists have instead spun this as straight-up cronyism. Green groups routinely slam the decision as a favor to "Ivanka's landlord." Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton decried the "shameful reversal" as proof that "big corporate money and special-interest influence now rule again." House Democrats sent letters to Interior and Agriculture Secretaries David Bernhardt and Sonny Perdue harping on the landlord question. The goal is to gin up a scandal of the type activists used to run out other Trump appointees.
Enter Ms. Klobuchar. Or, at least enter an email she wrote to then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Dec. 16, 2016, the day after the leases were blocked. Government sources provided me this missive, in which a furious Ms. Klobuchar punctures the scandal narrative and skewers her own party for putting politics ahead of the law.
Ms. Klobuchar bluntly states that the decision not to renew the lease "just floored me. Trump will reverse this. When you guys leave and are out talking about a job message for rural America, I will be left with the mess and dealing with the actual jobs. But you guys sure got a good story in the New York Times." She's the one who has to run for re-election in a state that still values its mining industry.
She lectures Mr. Vilsack that this "should have been handled through the normal process. It wasn't." She notes that she'd asked written questions in July but got no response. She brutally observes that the failure to do this right is "most likely . . . why we have the trump administration to begin with." She also snaps: "Who cares about answering some pesky questions from a woman senator from the Midwest when you guys and the White House and the activists have all the politics down, right?"
She notes that the company "had had the leases for years," that the situation "will now end up in a lawsuit," and that "trump will reverse the decision or a court will." She adds: "I am not for or against this project but I just wanted a fair process based on science that told us the truth." (Klobuchar state director Ben Hill says the senator "has serious concerns about this project being so close to the Boundary Waters and has always wanted a thorough environmental review," and "does not believe the Trump administration will move forward in good faith to protect the environment.")
Here is a Democratic lawmaker, steeped in a home-state issue, calling this what it was: an Obama administration perversion of policy and law, done to appease green donors. She reminds Mr. Vilsack that Republicans will reverse the decision, for the obvious reason that this did not go through a "normal" or "fair" process. The Democrats and activists decrying this "scandal" also know this, although we don't have the benefit of their private correspondence.
Remember this story next time the left hurls another "corruption" accusation. Hard as it is for many to accept, Trump administration officials often act on what they believe to be sound policy. No ulterior motive required.

Texto completo: I'd like every American to be guaranteed health care, higher education and meaningful employment — things some Democratic candidates for president frequently refer to as "rights. " Trouble is, these are not rights, and to frame them as such is counterproductive to good causes.
In announcing her candidacy in January, Sen. Kamala Harris of California said, "I am running to declare education is a fundamental right, and we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college. " That's an admirable goal, but it's not a right, at least not yet. Most of us know our legal rights, beginning with those enumerated in the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, press and religion. They extend to protections such as due process and freedom from unreasonable search and seizure.
Read more commentary:
Take it from an economist, Medicare for All is the most sensible way to fix health care
Millennials like me waited to start families. Paid leave will let me spend time with them.
Warren knows what we're facing and she has plans, from Fox News to Facebook
What about such things as safe streets, functional utilities and preserved parks? As citizens we deserve them, but they are not among our legal rights.
Conflating moral objectives, sometimes referred to as "natural rights," with legal rights is trending. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweets, "Health care is a human right," she hurts the argument that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , are making on behalf of "Medicare for All. " Health care is vital, but it's not a right, at least not in the United States. The obvious proof is the fact that many Democrats are striving to make it one.
Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has introduced legislation to establish a federal jobs guarantee program. He believes that every American has the right to a job, "and that right has only become more important," he maintains, in an age of income inequality and discrimination.
Rights have expanded through history
Government guarantees are often called economic rights or positive rights — benefits, such as Social Security, to which citizens can claim a legal right. In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt proposed a "Second Bill of Rights," including jobs, education and medical care, the very things candidates are advocating today. He called them "new goals of human happiness and well-being. "
It was not clear whether FDR, who died the following year, was speaking of actual, enforceable rights or merely guideposts for a better society. He proposed "the right of every family to a decent home," but he stopped short of guaranteeing such a right by having government pay for the homes.
In today's politics, semantics matter, and inaccurately describing ambitious policies is a red flag. The undecided voter might reasonably say, "Persuade me, but don't claim something is a right when it's not. " Some conservatives fear costly "entitlements" and reject the notion that discretionary government spending can be lumped with our inalienable rights.
At the start of this decade, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that access to water is a human right. That seems eminently more reasonable than suggesting we are somehow entitled to universal pre-K.
Some things aren't rights but should be
To be clear, several legitimate rights have been challenged recently, despite laws and court decisions that support them. A woman's right to choose is being threatened and should be defended in state legislatures and in the courts. Voter suppression poses a risk to our electoral freedom, and we must take whatever steps needed to protect the right to vote. Women's rights to equal pay and opportunity, LBGTQ rights to marry and serve in the military — they, too, are established rights.
An interesting example of the power of words was seen recently in The New York Times, where an opinion writer stated flatly that child care is a "fundamental right. " Editors crafting the print-edition headline wisely inserted the word "should. " That made it "Child Care Should Be a Right" and gave readers a proper headline over an improperly worded op-ed. It's a distinction that makes a difference.
Candidates would be more convincing if they argued that things such as pre-K and employment "ought to be a right," or "deserve to be a right. " Alternatively, they could choose to remain silent, which is after all their Miranda rights.

J.P. Devine Movie Review: ‘The Souvenir’

Texto completo: Greater minds in the media are split. Many love it, others find it boring, tedious and pretentious, J.P. Devine writes.
Sometimes, when I read the “prominent” film critics who all seem to live in one of those intellectual timeshares on Mt. Olympus, I feel like the skinny kid with glasses, acne and a stutter, left out on the ball field when the jocks start assembling teams.
If you’re one of those viewers who hang on the words and reputations of the cinema chatting class, Joanna Hogg’s “The Souvenir” is for you.
An example: A.O. Scott of the New York Times says of Hogg’s film, “It’s an absolute joy to watch.”
Anne Cohen of Refinery 29 says, “I can’t wait for the sequel.”
And It has won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival award. So there.
This film seems to have touched the souls of the more prominent cinema scribes. I’ve seen this happen so many times, and I’m not surprised. Sadly, I seem to have escaped prominence, but here in the piney woods I’m all you’ve got. I won’t ask you to trust me. Go see it and make up your own mind. But remember, I told you that Moxie tasted like shoe polish and you didn’t listen.
I’m sure most of the critics and their followers were drawn to this slow dance by the presence of the very strange but funny Tilda Swinton, of whom I’m a big fan.
Tilda, if you follow her career, is a mystical chameleon who can pop up in anything, anywhere and as anyone. Sometimes you won’t know she’s there until the credits. Sadly, Tilda appears here in a tiny conventional role in her daughter Honor Swinton Byrne’s film. The housemaid in The Marx Brother’s “Room Service” had more screen time than Tilda.
Perhaps she appeared in the film to give a boost to her daughter’s career?
Daughter Honor, who by the way is not bad on her first real role, tries her hand as Julie, a London film student.
Somewhere along the beginning of the movie, (I don’t recall exactly where because he’s just suddenly there) she falls under the spell of an older non-student Anthony, (Tom Burke) a whispering, emotional, bisexual scam artist, natty junkie and pusher, who mumbles at the bottom of his voice and who is given to sashaying around in David Hockney bow ties and retro Noel Coward loungewear.
The romance is totally implausible, because any hip, London working girl of the era would have chucked this lout out on his ear early on.
Cinematographer David Raedeker wastes his camera on multiple foggy views that seem to be shot through someone’s borrowed prescription glasses and murky night scenes seemingly lifted from Alfred Hitchcock’s 1927 “The Lodger.”
And then there are the strange unexplained sequences that simply wash away without explanations: Julie hears a rumpus upstairs in her apartment and finds Anthony moaning and crying, with his underwear covered in blood. No explanation offered.
Julie comes home to find their apartment has been robbed and Anthony beside himself. A bit later, he mumbles a confession. She forgives him.
At one point, Julie comes home to find a strange tattooed man in the house and orders him out.
Julie follows a trail of notes up to their bedroom when an explosion is heard on the street, and no one seems to check it out.
As usual, greater minds in the media are split. Many love it, others find it boring, tedious and pretentious.
But then again, I am the skinny kid with glasses who grew up on better stuff.

The inconvenient truth about a champion for female victims

Texto completo: There's more than enough horror to go around in "When They See Us," the new Netflix miniseries about the infamously mishandled sexual assault known as the Central Park jogger case. There are police officers who coerce confessions, and prison guards who brutalize the minors under their watch. But the most concentrated depravity, by far, is embodied in Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein.
As portrayed by Felicity Huffman, Fairstein is the mastermind behind the arrest and prosecution of five underage boys - four African American and one Hispanic - who were innocent of the rape but spent years in prison until the real perpetrator confessed. His DNA was present at the scene; the boys weren't connected to any physical evidence at all. Huffman's Fairstein is unbothered by the boulder-sized holes in her case, happy to massage timelines and ignore relevant testimony. Later, while the boys languished in prison, she launched a glamorous career as a mystery novelist.
It's no surprise that viewers of "When They See Us" have come away enraged; the character of Fairstein is enraging. In the past few days petitions have circulated, begging fiction readers to stop buying Fairstein's novels, demanding her publisher stop printing them. Fairstein shut down all of her social media accounts after a weekend of backlash, which caused even more backlash: Her few days of discomfort on Twitter were nothing, after all, compared to years spent in prison for a crime you didn't commit.
"When They See Us" is not a documentary but an adaptation, one that Fairstein didn't participate in. Director Ava DuVernay told the Daily Beast that Fairstein was contacted, "but she tried to negotiate conditions for her to speak with me, including approvals over the script"; DuVernay refused those terms. I reached out to Fairstein, asking if she'd like to comment on her portrayal, and received no response.
And then, because I was 8 years old at the time of the trial and, like a lot of Netflix viewers, had only been passingly familiar with the case, I went down a research rabbit hole. I was curious about the real Linda Fairstein. I wanted to know what she'd said about the case. I wanted to know how terrible she'd truly been.
And I learned that as recently as 2018, Fairstein was still defending the interrogations as "respectful" and "dignified." I read a 2002 interview, conducted after the actual perpetrator had come forward, in which Fairstein shrugged off his confession by folding it into her preferred narrative: that the confessed rapist must have been hanging out with the teenagers that night, she argued - just one of many guilty parties. The investigation, she maintained, had been "brilliant police work."
But what was most surprising to me were not the articles that made me dislike her. Remember, I was expecting those. What surprised me most were the celebratory stories. The articles - some written before the Central Park case and some written after - where Fairstein is a hero.
The New York Times ran a 1990 profile, for example, entitled "Linda Fairstein vs. Rape." Published a few months before the Central Park trial, the piece applauded her leadership in the sex-crimes unit - a bold and novel concept in a justice system that was only then beginning to learn how to deal with sexual assault.
Fairstein fought to reframe conversations about rape, the story explained. In one case, she protested the courtroom inclusion of a victim's "sex diary," because she believed allowing it into evidence was tantamount to blaming the victim. She said she wanted to overhaul the "he said-she said" mentality that always seemed to give more weight to the man's side of the story. She wanted people to believe women. Basic as it sounds now, 30 years ago much of this philosophy was revolutionary.
She brought a lot of swagger to her public persona, journalists wrote at the time - but she believed in what she was doing, and what she was doing was good.
Even after the Central Park convictions were vacated, even after the case came to be recognized as a travesty of justice, Fairstein was still named a Glamour Magazine Woman of the Year; she served on Vassar College's Board of Trustees; she went on book tours.
I don't bring any of this up to defend Fairstein, because absolutely nothing about the Central Park Five case is defensible. I bring it up to complicate her. I bring it up because I recognize, with sickened dismay, that I, as a woman, probably benefited from her earlier accomplishments.
And meanwhile, the Central Park trial leaned into America's worst, most racist impulses. Meanwhile, it destroyed the lives of five children while making things worse for countless others by promoting the hideous myth that black men pose a unique danger to white women.
I can't stop thinking about the moral calculus that was performed, for years, by every organization that invited Fairstein to be on its board, or speak at its functions, or receive its awards.
The work she'd done for victims, they decided, could outweigh the role she'd played in ruining five boys' lives. The books she wrote were interesting enough, apparently, to excuse the fact that five children had been wrongfully imprisoned while she was writing them. A lot of us performed that moral calculus, too: The books didn't become bestsellers on their own.
When we talk about Linda Fairstein, we're talking about our society, too. We're talking about the things we decide we'll pay attention to. And the things we decide we'll overlook.

Trump says transgender people banned from military over drug use

Texto completo: President Trump said his administration reinstituted a ban against most transgender people serving in the military because some of them take prescription medicine, claiming erroneously that the armed services prohibit drug use.
Trump was asked why he implemented the ban, which took effect in March, during an interview with ITV's "Good Morning Britain" broadcast earlier on Wednesday.
"Because they take massive amounts of drugs, they have to," Trump said. "You're not allowed to take drugs, you're in the military you're not allowed to take any drugs. And they have to after the operation, they have to, they have no choice, they have to. You would actually have to break rules and regulations in order to have that."
The military doesn't prohibit service members from taking prescription medicines, including drugs prescribed for conditions such as depression and anxiety. The Navy, in fact, changed its policy late last year to allow pilots and other aircrew on such drugs to continue flying.
The Pentagon said it pays for medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. "Generally speaking, we cover all medically necessary and FDA-approved treatments for our service members," said Lieutenant Colonel Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman.
Some transgender people choose to take prescription hormones that change their sexual characteristics, and some also undergo sexual reassignment surgery, but the term "transgender" isn't dependent on medical procedures.
Challenged by interviewer Piers Morgan, who said that the cost of prescription hormones for transgender service members was "minuscule" compared to the Pentagon's overall budget, Trump complained about the cost and burden of sexual reassignment surgery.
"Look, massive amounts and also people going in and asking for the operation —- you know the operation is 200,000, 250,000 dollars, and getting the operation, the recovery period is long and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that for whatever reason — but large amounts, and that's not the way it is," Trump said. "I mean you can't do that. So I said yeah, when it came time to make a decision on that and because of the drugs and also because of the cost of the operation."
Medical services specific to transgender people cost the military about $8 million between 2016 and February of this year, according to the Defense Department. About 1,525 troops had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since July 1, 2016, when Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, lifted a military ban on transgender people openly serving and allowed them to seek medical treatment.
Total military spending for health care was estimated to be about $44 billion in fiscal 2018, according to the Pentagon's comptroller.
Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a research group that had worked with the Obama administration to repeal the previous ban, said Trump's comments showed a lack of knowledge about medical research on transgender people.
"Trump asserted falsely that active-duty servicemembers cannot take even so much as an aspirin," Belkin said in a statement. "And he repeated the debunked canards that medical care for transgender servicemembers is unmanageably expensive and that trans troops cannot be held to the same standards as other troops."
Trump tweeted in July 2017 that he would reimpose the transgender ban, but it was delayed by court challenges and didn't take effect until April. The policy allows transgender service members who were already taking hormones or undergoing sexual reassignment surgery to continue receiving care, but prohibits future enlistments by anyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria.
Transgender service members who weren't receiving medical care as of the date of the ban are required to serve in their birth gender.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , does not want President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to be held in solitary confinement, she said in a Wednesday morning tweet.
Ocasio-Cortez was responding to a to a New York Times report that Manafort may be held in solitary confinement at the Rikers Island jail in New York.
Noting that the notorious prison was located in her district, the freshman representative called solitary confinement a "license for gov torture and human rights violations. "
"Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary," she continued.
On Tuesday, sources familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that Manafort would soon be transferred to Rikers Island jail while awaiting trial on state fraud charges. The New York Times first reported the pending transfer, saying that Manafort would likely be entering solitary confinement once his transfer was complete.
Manafort had been held in solitary confinement while awaiting a separate federal trial.
Soon after, the state of New York unsealed a 16-count indictment alleging Manafort committed fraud on mortgage applications.
Ocasio-Cortez has been previously outspoken about solitary confinement, calling the practice "torture" in an April tweet in which she called for former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning's release from solitary and a ban on extended solitary confinement.

Second-day picks can transform

Texto completo: Typically, the MLB draft commands attention for a night at best. There's so much time between when a player is selected by an organization and starts his pro career and when he actually emerges in the big leagues — three years for a college player and five years for a high schooler represent relatively rapid timetables — that it's hard for observers to maintain interest once the initial rounds come and go.
Yet for an organization, the second day of the draft — the third through 10th rounds — offers the potential to transform a franchise. A year ago, the Red Sox took a relatively unheralded infielder out of Long Beach State, Jarren Duran, in the seventh round. On Monday, the team promoted Duran to Double A Portland after he dominated the High-A Carolina League while posting the highest average in the minors as the headline stat in a .387/.456/.543 line with 26 extra-base hits and 18 steals in 50 games. He looks like a potential everyday player.
In 2016, the Red Sox took Santiago Espinal in the 10th round. He became a chip to acquire eventual World Series MVP Steve Pearce last year. Most famously, in 2011, the Red Sox took an undersized high school shortstop, Mookie Betts, in the fifth round. Over time, he exceeded all of the team's projections for him at the time to become a star.
“You know the odds [in the draft] — they aren't high," said Red Sox scout Justin Horowitz, who was the area scout who recommended Duran in 2018. “When you're able to acquire players a little bit deeper that have a lot of impact on the organization, whether in the minor leagues or major leagues, obviously we're looking for players who play at Fenway and have an impact on the big league level for years to come, Mookie Betts in the fifth round, but even guys that you can provide trade value with, give Dave Dombrowski a piece or two to help our big league roster, that's what gets me excited. I love Day 2 of the draft. It's my favorite day.
“Day 1, you've got the high-impact pick. You've got to nail them. But Day 2, you find a guy who's maybe still around, you might be able to create a little bit of value for the organization. That really gets me going, for sure."
On Tuesday, the Red Sox — whose 108-win season has them picking last in every round — closed out the third round by selecting 21-year-old righthander Ryan Zeferjahn out of the University of Kansas with the 107th overall pick. According to Baseball America, the 6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound righthander features “one of the better fastballs in this year's draft," an offering that sits at 94-95 miles per hour and tops out at 97, with occasional signs of a slider and changeup that are weapons.
The publication suggested that he lacked consistency with those three pitches, likely due to an arm slot that moves up and down, en route to a 5-2 record and 3.97 ERA with 10.9 strikeouts and 4.5 walks per nine innings.
At his best, his three-pitch mix shows the raw materials of a quality starter, but his lack of control and inconsistency might portend a future bullpen move. Either way, he has a live arm that creates obvious appeal.
In the fourth round, the Red Sox took college righthander Noah Song out of the Naval Academy. Song features a mid-90s fastball and a good curveball, attributes that ordinarily might have had the 6-4 pitcher taken earlier in the draft. But as Billy Witz of the New York Times recently explained, he must first fulfill a military commitment. In all likelihood, it will be at least two years before Song can pursue a professional career.
Song's fourth-round selection is the highest ever by a Navy alum, a reflection on one hand of his dominant season (11-1, 1.44 ERA, 15.4 strikeouts per nine innings) but also of the uncertainty teams have about what his service commitment will mean to his development.
In the fifth round, the Red Sox tabbed Zeferjahn's batterymate at Kansas, catcher/first baseman Jaxx Groshans. The junior had a startling breakthrough, going from a solid .313/.355/.464 line with four homers and more than twice as many strikeouts (30) as walks (14) as a sophomore to a junior campaign in which he hit .340/.475/.604 with 12 homers while walking more (53 times) than he struck out (40).
In the sixth, the team took lefty Chris Murphy from the University of San Diego. As a junior, he showed swing-and-miss stuff (12.2 strikeouts per nine innings) though he lost the strike zone at times (6.0 walks per nine) while going 4-3 with a 3.50 ERA. In the Cape League last summer, he featured a fastball that registered out of the mid-90s out of the bullpen and low-90s as a starter, complementing that with a breaking ball and changeup.
In the seventh round, the Red Sox took college righthander Brock Bell. At State College of Florida as a junior, Bell pitched just 38 innings in three years, but posted impressive numbers when doing so, striking out 45 and walking eight while forging a 2.84 ERA (though it's worth noting he allowed more unearned runs (13) than earned runs (12) during his career).
In the eighth round, the team took outfielder Wil Dalton from the University of Florida. Dalton, a 2018 All-SEC second-teamer who showed significant power as a freshman and sophomore, had a down junior season, hitting .250/.365/.432 with seven homers (after going deep 19 times as a sophomore).
In the ninth round, the Sox selected Arkansas righthander Cody Scoggins, a pitcher who, as a college senior, would have little leverage in the draft and thus is likely to sign for a bonus less than the slot-recommended amount, thus permitting the Red Sox to invest some of the bonus pool money earmarked for his pick to other players who will need more than their slot value to sign. Scroggins had a 4.66 ERA while splitting time between the rotation and bullpen, striking out 48 and walking 25 in 38⅔ innings.
The Red Sox closed out Day 2 of the draft by taking Stephen Scott, a senior out of Vanderbilt, in the 10th round.
Scott was both a catcher and outfielder in his college career. As a senior, he hit .335/.456/.579 with 11 homers.

Hostels can put togetherness in family trip

Texto completo: Checking into the Abraham Hostel Tel Aviv in spring 2017 at the end of a family trip to Israel, Amy Friedman's two teenage daughters took a look at the bare-bones room that slept four for about $130 and wondered if the trip was ending on a thud rather than a bang.
"It took about four hours to fall in love," said Friedman, a television executive who lives in Montclair, New Jersey. Looking around the communal spaces, the girls found an art exhibition on the roof, swings in the living room, Ping-Pong and "a lot of young travelers so they could project what it might be like to travel when they're older. We wanted to help the girls to picture travel they will be able to afford."
Sparsely furnished, communally focused and very affordable, hostels - which traditionally offer shared bathrooms and dormlike sleeping quarters that might house dozens of strangers - have usually been associated with student travel. But hostels have evolved to appeal to couples and especially families by providing private rooms, often with several beds and private bathrooms.
In the United States, a number of new-wave hostels with family rooms and hotel amenities, such as those run by the London-based group Generator, have recently opened. Hybrid hotels such as the Freehand brand in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York have adopted the model to offer rooms that sleep up to six people traveling together. In 2020, the Berlin-based hybrid Meininger Hotel plans to open its first U.S. outpost in Washington, D.C., with 616 beds in 154 rooms.
"Traditional hotels have not done a good job catering to families in the big cities," said Rainer Jenss, the president of the Family Travel Association. "The biggest advantage of hostels is access to local communities, both in terms of location - they are usually centrally located, near public transportation - and built-in concierge expertise in the area. And it's a great way to get ideas from other travelers."
According to Hostelling International USA, a nonprofit that runs 50 hostels, hostels got their start in Germany in 1909. Alarmed by the impact of the Industrial Revolution on students' health, an elementary schoolteacher named Richard Shirrmann organized weekend field trips to the country with overnights in local school buildings.
Permanent hostels grew to more than 2,000 nationally by 1932 and the first youth hostel in the United States opened in Northfield, Massachusetts, in 1934.
Saving money together
Most family traffic is driven by saving money and a desire to stay together. According to the travel data firm STR, the average daily rate for a hotel room in the United States in 2018 was about $130, meaning a family of four, if required to take two rooms, might end up paying $260 or more a night.
"Booking two rooms for two parents and two kids breaks up the family travel purpose of being together," said Santiago Leon, the general manager of the 89-room Robey hotel in Chicago. When it opened in 2016, 20 of those rooms had more than two beds and sold as dorms, but within the year were converted to private rooms based largely on demand by families. Known as Annex Lofts, the rooms sleep up to five and start at $160.
Home shares like Airbnb similarly satisfy the need for togetherness, but may lack the social interaction that is at the heart of staying in a hostel.
"What makes a hostel a hostel is the focus of bringing people together in a shared experience," said Netanya Trimboli, the spokeswoman for HIUSA, which has family rooms from $77 a night on Cape Cod and $106 in Montara, California, on the grounds of a 19th-century lighthouse 25 miles north of San Francisco.
On a practical level, most hostels have shared kitchens with cooking facilities, which can save more money and serve picky eaters.
Seeing a city, meeting the world
Many hostels build community through free events. The HI Houston, for example, has weekly museum tours and nacho nights.
"Hostels tend to have access to discounts and offers to things happening in cities," Jenss said. "Hostelling would be very attractive to a family interested in immersing in local cultures."
Generator, which has 13 locations in Europe, says between 15% and 18% of its business annually is family traffic and has shifted its room inventory to encourage family travelers with more four- to six-bed rooms. Opened in October 2018, Generator Miami offers 300 beds in 105 rooms a block from the ocean, with rates from $23 for a bunk in a shared room and $104 for a four-bed room. Amenities include a restaurant, beach chairs and towels, a swimming pool and rental bikes.
"From age 10 or 11, we have different communal areas," said Alastair Thomann, the chief executive of Generator, highlighting a new partnership with EA Sports to bring sports video consoles. "That's why I think hostels are so popular, because they are social spaces."
Play areas also foster connections between children. For Claudia M. Laroye, a freelance writer from Vancouver, a hostel in Locarno, Switzerland, gave her children, then 9 and 11, the chance to play with others from Spain despite not sharing a language.
"I've noticed that children are real icebreakers if they have commonalities where language is a barrier for adults," she said. "They don't suffer the same hesitations."
Guarding privacy and safety
The growth of private rooms with private baths has, for the most part, solved the privacy issue at hostels, but often only if a family buys out an entire multi-bunk room. My family of three took a gamble on a room with four beds at Milford Sound Lodge in Fiordland National Park in New Zealand two years ago, saving more than $200, and wound up with a roommate, albeit one we never met, who showed up after we were asleep and, unfortunately, set his alarm for hours before we wanted to rise.
Another potential pitfall may be exposing a child to adult topics - in our case graffiti written on the wooden bunks about "Nick at reception" having access to "good weed" (though the lodge, also a hotel, is not overtly a party place). To our 17-year-old, this was hilarious teen humor, especially since Nick appeared in several non-drug-related posts, but parents of younger children concerned about language may want to inquire about dorm maintenance before booking.
"The one issue that concerned us was the all-night party scene. Will we be able to get to sleep?" said Jenss, who has stayed in several hostels with his children and advises phoning the hostel to discuss noise and booking a private room.
Multi-bed rooms at hybrid hotels like the Freehand New York, with hanging baskets of apples and graphics painted on the walls, feel more like hotels, even with bunk beds. But for basic hostels, parents may need to prepare children.
"You need to frame it, to help kids understand the why behind the choice," Friedman said, adding that the bargain hostel she stayed at in Tel Aviv was an opportunity to demonstrate travel budgeting to her children, using the savings as a rationale for a more expensive restaurant or a second soda.

Texto completo: After 33 games and average daily winnings of $77,000, James Holzhauer's remarkable "Jeopardy" winning streak came to an end Monday.
The University of Illinois math graduate finished $58,484 shy of Ken Jennings' record prize money of $2.52 million, losing to a Chicago librarian, Emma Boettcher.
Holzhauer, 34, responded, as always, with humor once the show aired Monday, tweeting, "I knew I shouldn't have invited @Drake to the @Jeopardy taping."
"Nobody likes to lose," he told The New York Times. "But I'm very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So I don't feel bad about it."
Holzhauer, a professional sports gambler who lives in Las Vegas, also couldn't resist tweeting about Sunday's vote by the Illinois Legislature to legalize sports betting in Illinois.
"Trying to get me to move back before my Jeopardy tax bill hits, eh?" he responded to the tweet from ESPN Chalk writer David Payne Purdum.
Holzhauer rewrote the strategy book for "Jeopardy," tackling big-dollar questions first, betting big on Daily Doubles and rarely missing an answer, building up insurmountable leads on his challengers.
But Boettcher ended up beating him at his own game Monday, winning by almost $22,000.
Throughout Holzhauer's run, he appeared to enjoy interacting with fans on Twitter and other venues.
He and his wife also donated some of his winnings to charity, and Holzhauer challenged other "Jeopardy" winners to support a pediatric cancer fundraiser -- by having his wife crack and egg over his head for the #CrackCancer challenge.
What now for the Papa Del's fan? Probably a party.
"My kid cried about the possibility of her dad losing, so I told her we could have a party the day after it inevitably happens. Now she cries when I win," he tweeted Sunday, before his last episode aired.

CHAMPAIGN PUBLIC LIBRARY
Budget balanced, but funds needed
CHAMPAIGN -- Without any assistance from the city, the Champaign Public Library will once again have a balanced budget, thanks in large part to charitable donations of over $300,000.
But like the city, the library also has a number of unfunded needs it must find outside money to meet, like potentially adding more staff to cover security and after-school shifts and run the service desk.
And as library Director Donna Pittman said during a council meeting last week, it's all because the library is performing so well.
"We're looking now at adding more hours on the weekends," Pittman said, which is something she's heard the community advocate for.
"We want to expand our virtual presence, our resources that people can access 24/7, and we want to expand outreach to address targeted community needs."
Pittman said the library has already reached its capacity for cultural events and activities.
Space is at a premium, she said, and the library wants to expand opportunities for civic engagement, lifelong learning and general meeting spaces because "we just don't have room for everyone who wants to come."
The increase in the library's popularity is apparent to anyone who has driven around it in the past few years. Some of its initiatives include workforce-development training, early-childhood learning programs and career-building classes.
Through a partnership with the Champaign school district, the library has also expanded its membership, issuing 788 library cards to students.
Forty-one of them would not have been eligible without the partnership.
And through a partnership with Tumble Books, the library has provided more than 1,900 books to teachers for classroom libraries.
With the help of the Mother Goose Program, a library staff member has given out over 4,000 books to build home libraries.
It's all well worth it for council member Matthew Gladney, who said the library's contributions are "immeasurable."
"I still hear compliments about the building over a decade later," he said.
"But even more than the building is the people in it. Even though people come and go, we've always had quality folks at the library. People always think of libraries as a place where books sit on shelves, but our library has always been more than that, to its credit, and continues to be that."
Ninety-six percent of the library's 2019-20 budget of $7.9 million comes from property taxes.

MAHOMET-SEYMOUR SCHOOL BOARD
Tax anticipation warrants planned
MAHOMET -- For the first time in more than 20 years, the Mahomet-Seymour school district expects to issue tax anticipation warrants in order to pay its bills this summer due to a lag in property tax funds due from Champaign County.
"It's unprecedented," Trent Nuxoll, the district's chief school business official, said of the delay in funding.
On Monday, school board members unanimously approved a resolution authorizing up to $3 million in the warrants "in anticipation of the collection of taxes levied for the year 2018 for educational purposes."
Nuxoll reminded the board that 53 percent of the district's total revenue comes from local property taxes.
The county treasurer's office typically sends tax bills to property owners by May 1, and schools receive large payments of their portion of taxes in May and June.
Nuxoll said Mahomet-Seymour normally receives about 55 percent of its annual revenue in those months.
That's around $8.9 million in total, he added.
According to the website for Champaign County Treasurer Laurel Prussing, as of Monday morning, property tax bills had been mailed, and the first installment is due July 1.
Although the district has some reserve funds, they're not enough to cover expected bills in July without property tax revenue.
The resolution approved by the board allows up to $3 million to be borrowed via tax anticipation warrants (TAWs) at a maximum interest rate of 4 percent, with the latest maturity being Sept. 3.

Michael Wolff: 56-page Mueller memo on indicting Trump does exist

Texto completo: Author Michael Wolff defended the claim in his new book that special counsel Robert Mueller drafted a document outlining legal arguments for indicting President Trump.
Although last week Mueller’s spokesman denied that a draft indictment was drawn up, Wolff said a 56-page memorandum was put together that supposes Trump was indicted for obstruction of justice.
“It assumes that the president has been indicted. It assumes that he in turn has come back and made a motion to dismiss that indictment on grounds that you can't indict a sitting president,” Wolff said in an interview Monday evening on MSNBC. “Then this document is a response to that.”
Wolf said the document outlined what charges Trump would face and argued why a sitting president can and should be indicted.
“So it’s in a way I think that missing piece of the Mueller puzzle,” Wolff said.
The existence of a three-count obstruction of justice indictment was first reported in a preview of Wolff's new book, Siege: Trump Under Fire, by the Guardian, which also said it had viewed the documents.
In response, Mueller spokesman Peter Carr issued a rare statement that said “the documents that you’ve described do not exist.”
Wolff’s last book, Fire and Fury, was riddled with unsubstantiated allegations, several of which were denounced as false. His new book, which hits bookshelves Tuesday, is already facing accusations of falsehoods, and in an interview with the New York Times Wolff admitted he does not check his stories with his subjects.
In his report, Mueller wrote that his team determined there was insufficient evidence to show criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. The report also laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to say whether he committed obstruction, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted.
Attorney General William Barr concluded Mueller’s investigation did not find “sufficient” evidence to determine whether Trump obstructed justice. Barr defended the president’s behavior during the investigation as Trump being “frustrated and angry” with a process he believed was politically motivated.
Mueller, who announced he was resigning last week, said charging Trump with a crime was “not an option we could consider,” citing Justice Department policy. “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so,” Mueller said. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
Barr contradicted the reasoning the special counsel gave about why he did not make a determination on obstruction. “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision," Barr said during an interview with CBS on Thursday. Barr said Mueller “had his reasons for not doing it” but declined to explain. “I’m not going to, you know, argue about those reasons,” he said.

Impeachment issue is thorn for Democrats and Trump

Texto completo: The threat of impeachment hangs over the White House, but it also vexes House Democrats wary of taking next steps against President Trump without broader public support.
Leading Democrats provided a snapshot Sunday of the party wrestling with the impeachment questions posed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings in the Russia investigation. One top leader, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the Democratic whip, said the president may well face an impeachment inquiry in the House. Another, Representative Adam Schiff of California suggested it's not likely soon, if at all.
"We're not there yet," Schiff said on ABC's "This Week."
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stopped short of pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump despite an increasing number of lawmakers, including some 2020 presidential contenders, clamoring to do so. She is wary of embarking on a politically divisive debate that she worries would all but drown out the House's policy agenda and campaign promises. Lawmakers heard mixed views during a recess week back home and Pelosi faced those favoring impeachment during the weekend California Democrats' party meeting.
Instead, six House committees are probing deeply into Trump's business dealings, his running of the government, and whether or not the president obstructed Mueller's investigation.
"What I have said time and time again is, Mueller has developed the grounds for impeachment. The House has to determine the timing for impeachment. There's a big difference," Clyburn said on CNN's "State of the Union."
"We are trying to take our time and do this right," Clyburn said. "So I don't see this as being out of whack with what the people's aspirations are."
Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, signaled that the House may ultimately decline to pursue impeachment.

Pentagon chief not planning USS John McCain probe
The Pentagon doesn't need to investigate a White House directive for the Navy to move the warship USS John S. McCain from view before President Trump's recent trip to Japan, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said Sunday.
The White House military office requested that the Seventh Fleet keep the warship "hidden from view," Shanahan told reporters en route to South Korea. But the directive wasn't carried out, and "all ships remained in normal configuration during the visit," he said.
"No, I am not planning any IG investigation," Shanahan said when asked if the inspector-general would investigate. No investigation was needed "because there was nothing really carried out," he said.
Trump said on Thursday that a "well-meaning" person appears to have made the request, but said he personally would not have done so. The ship carries the name of the late senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who was a frequent critic of Trump, as well as his father and grandfather.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, on "Fox News Sunday," called the USS McCain incident "much ado about nothing."
The unidentified staff member behind the request wouldn't be disciplined for asking if the ship should be visible given the president's "well known" feelings about the late senator, he said.

Florida congressman hit by a thrown drink cup
A Florida congressman who frequently appears on television supporting President Trump was struck by a thrown drink as he left a town hall.
US Representative Matt Gaetz wasn't injured Saturday when he was struck by a plastic cup lobbed by a protester in Pensacola, Fla.
Video posted online shows the second-term Republican leaving a coffee house while about 20 protesters chant their opposition. The cup struck him in the back.
Amanda Kondrat'yev was charged with misdemeanor battery and released on $1,000 bond. She briefly ran against Gaetz in 2016 before dropping out.
Gaetz tweeted about the incident saying, "Clearly it takes more than a drink to slow down our great team."

Biden declares LGBTQ rights his No. 1 legislative priority
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden declared Saturday that the Equality Act would be his top legislative priority, an effort to enshrine LGBTQ protections into the nation's labor and civil rights laws.
The former vice president shared his hopes of signing the legislation as part of a keynote address to hundreds of activists at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala on the first day of Pride Month. In a half-hour at the lectern, his remarks ranged from emotional tributes to his audience and their personal endurance to condemnations of President Trump.
"It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing," Biden said of the Trump administration. Among other Trump polices, he cited attempts to bar transgender troops in the US military, allow individuals in the medical field to refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals, and allow homeless shelters to refuse transgender occupants.
"Just like with racial justice and women's rights, we are seeing pushback against all the progress we've made toward equality," Biden said.
The Equality Act would address many such discriminatory practices. It recently passed the Democratic-run House, but will not become law under Trump and the Republican Senate. That means LGBTQ residents in dozens of states are still subject to various forms of discrimination that are either specifically allowed or not barred by state law.
"It will be the first thing I ask to be done," Biden said.
Biden spoke in Ohio, a political battleground he was visiting for the first time since beginning his bid, on the same day that more than a dozen of his rivals were in San Francisco for the California Democratic Convention and a massive MoveOn.org conference.

Sanders after dark: Inside his first 'grass-roots fund-raiser'
Senator Bernie Sanders has long promised to run a different kind of campaign and be a different kind of president. On Saturday night, what was billed as his first “grass-roots fund-raiser" of the 2020 campaign was certainly different, as donor events go.
It was at a nightclub, for one thing. The DJ was spinning a mix that included “Eye of the Tiger," the underdog anthem from the “Rocky" movie series. Tickets were as cheap as $27, for another. There were food trucks out back (tacos and a Taiwanese-Korean blend).
The night had the vibe of a Sanders rally, only smaller, darker, and more intimate, and with booze. Disco balls dangled from the ceiling. When the lights flashed briefly during his remarks, Sanders joked about the special effects.
“Very sophisticated," he deadpanned. “Either that or someone was leaning on the light switch."
People laughed. This was, after all, Sanders' crowd to lose, and he did not lose them, despite some delays before taking the stage.
Sanders has made his rejection of big donors and traditional fund-raisers a centerpiece of his message and, in a field of 23 candidates, has begun scheduling in-person events to keep his grip on small donors as his rivals try to make inroads.

Trump: Jerry West to get Medal of Freedom
President Trump says that Jerry West, the pro basketball great, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
"The Great Jerry West will be receiving our Nation's highest civilian honor, The Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his outstanding career, both on and off the court," according to the Trump Saturday night tweet. West, a member of the basketball Hall of Fame, played guard for the Los Angeles Lakers and played college basketball at West Virginia University. No date was announced for the award for the 81-year-old West.

Texto completo: PRESQUE ISLE, Maine -- The University of Maine at Presque Isle Library has received a gift of about 150 books, with more coming, about World War I thanks to a generous donation.
Officially named the Nick Fowler Collection after the original owner of the books, the collection greatly increases the breadth of the library's offerings on the subject of World War I.
"The Library at UMPI is very grateful to be selected as a permanent home for this extraordinary collection on World War I," said Roger Getz, UMPI director of library services. "The books not only offer a cultural and historical perspective of the Great War, but also take the readers into this time period that has so influenced our society today.
"The request for the books to be a part of our circulating collection is quite unusual for the quality of the collection," he added. "The collection will be available to all citizens in Maine and beyond through borrowing privileges and inter library loan. We cannot thank Mr. Fowler and Dr. Zillman enough for their generous gift to our library."
The books came to UMPI in a somewhat unexpected way. Former UMPI President Don Zillman first connected with Fowler during one of the readings of his book "Living the World War," a two-volume study of the American experience in World War I. Zillman spent several years working on the books, which he co-authored with Elizabeth Elsbach, a 2016 University of Maine School of Law graduate, Zillman's former research assistant, and a European history major.
Comprising more than 1,200 pages, the books draw on reporting from the New York Times and daily debates in the U.S. Congress to show how events unfolded from the perspective of those who lived through them.
In speaking with Fowler about their shared interest in the Great War, Zillman learned that Fowler had about 200 books on WWI that he was willing to give away. Fowler, a longtime medical professional in the Portland area, was retiring to Colorado and couldn't take his collection with him. After selecting some of the books to keep and offering some up to the University of Maine, Zillman offered the collection to UMPI.
"We are so appreciative of Nick's gift," Zillman said. "The centennial of the World War reminded us of how central those years were to the America of today. I've had the pleasure of reading all of the books before passing them on to the permanent collections at UMPI and UMaine. Nick's talent for selection is uncanny; there hasn't been one that hasn't been informative and riveting."
A distinguishing feature of the collection is that many of the books feature British authors, subjects and publishers.
Now on the shelves at the UMPI Library and with special labels indicating that they are part of the Nick Fowler collection, the books are ready for another generation of researchers and history buffs to explore.
For more information about the collection, or to learn how you can donate books to the UMPI Library, contact Getz at 207-768-9595 or roger.getz@maine.edu.

Texto completo: From the summer of 2014 through March 2015, The New York Times reported last week, Navy pilots regularly encountered impossibly fast and agile aircraft while training over the East Coast.
To this day, they have no explanation for them.
They are, in the truest sense of the phrase, unidentified flying objects. As a result of the reports, made by several highly trained aviators with years of experience in the military's top aircraft, the Navy issued pilots new guidelines for dealing with unexplained aerial phenomena.
The new guidelines formalized a process that has taken place for decades. The public airing of these guidelines, and the confirmation in 2017 of a government operation tasked with investigating aerospace threats, is seen as an indication that the military has accepted the existence of UFOs - whatever their origin - and is taking them seriously.
That's good for a few reasons - most of them not having much to do with fears over a real-life "War of the Worlds."
First, it's healthy to remove the stigma from unexplained phenomena. There is no reason for the U.S. government to have so much secrecy around these sightings when the military, astronomers and everyday Americans have been documenting them for decades. While most of these sightings eventually can be explained - as something innocuous, such as a trick of the light, or a failing of our own human senses - studies have found 5 percent to be reliable yet inexplicable.
Mysteries
We should be able to talk about these mysteries - all of us, government included - without such forced secrecy. The government shouldn't get to hide this stuff from us just for the sake of hiding it.
Second, there are real national security concerns. Treating these sightings as secrets, or laughable, does not help the military deal with them. The Navy pilots interviewed by the Times said the aircraft they encountered could reach 30,000 feet and fly at hypersonic speeds, yet there was no sign of an engine or exhaust. The UFOs could stay up there all day, while the Navy jets could only fly for an hour. They could stop, accelerate and turn much too fast for human pilots to endure.
When the sightings first occurred, pilots thought they may be the result of mistaken radar, which had been recently upgraded. When they began picking them up visually, the pilots thought they might be dealing with high-tech drones from some classified program. When the "drones" almost collided with them multiple times over multiple altitudes, they knew it wasn't there own government flying these things.
taking it seriously
Even if it wasn't something out of "Independence Day," it got the military's attention. If some foreign adversary is using such advanced technology, they need to know.
And in the tiny chance that it is something more, we shouldn't hide from that realization. The size and age of our galaxy makes the presence of other life forms mathematically possible. If some civilization could reach us, they would certainly be more technologically advanced.
And such a meeting wouldn't be unprecedented in world history. When geography was enough to keep peoples unaware of each other's presence, something like alien meetings occurred regularly. The Romans were scared of the 7-foot-tall, pale white beings who lived in the forests to their far north. Eastern Europeans thought they were being attacked by an alien force when the Mongols first swept through. And what is the European settlement of the New World but the collision of two vastly different worlds previously unknown to each other?
Maybe with a little preparation, humans - and whoever else - can get it right this time.

JOE BIDEN, BE PROUD OF YOUR CRIME BILL THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT-RUNNER HELPED MAKE THE COUNTRY A LOT SAFER

Texto completo: Joe Biden has been attacked by politicians on the left - and now, thanks to Donald Trump, on the right - for his role in shepherding the 1994 crime bill through Congress. One of these attacks is simply cynical. The other is dangerous.
For those whose memories of early 1990s America are either foggy or nonexistent, it's worth recalling what life in much of urban America was like back then. A sample:
"The death yesterday of a 41-year-old armed security guard from Long Island was not an uncommon occurrence in East New York," The New York Times reported on Dec. 20, 1993. "Indeed, it followed 13 other killings in the 75th Precinct in the last nine days."
"What was uncommon about the killing," the report continued, "was that it broke a 20-year record for homicides in a single precinct, although with a footnote. Maurice Matola, the victim, was by unofficial count the 124th person killed this year in the 75th Precinct. . Last night, a shooting on Georgia Avenue made Anthony Broadnax, 17, the 125th person killed."
Fast-forward more than two decades to another story in The Times about the same neighborhood. "Once the 'Killing Fields,' East New York Has No Murders in 2018," ran an April 2018 headline, noting that the neighborhood had experienced a 129-day stretch without homicides. Citywide, New York ended last year with just under 300 murders, down 85 percent from the 1,960 it suffered in 1993.
Put those numbers in a different perspective: If the murder rate in New York had persisted at its 1993 level over the next 25 years, 49,000 people would have been killed. Instead, some 15,000 were. That's 34,000 New Yorkers spared. Nationwide, the equivalent figure exceeds 150,000. Those were the teenagers who did come home that night, the mom or dad or sibling who wasn't missed at dinner. It's one of the most impressive social achievements of the past 30 years.
What did the 1994 crime bill have to do with it?
There's a topic for a long debate. The bill coincided with an economic boom, the cresting of the crack-cocaine wave and, according to one notorious theory, the unintended benefit of legalized abortion eliminating thousands of would-be criminals before they had a chance to be born.
But economic growth has no obvious correlation with crime (homicide rates fell during both the Great Depression and the Great Recession). Property crimes have continued to fall despite the current opioid epidemic. And the abortion theory rests on the questionable hypothesis that unwanted pregnancies, if brought to term, are likelier to produce criminally disposed kids.
What really changed after 1994 was that we hired more cops, incarcerated more offenders and, most important, policed our streets a lot better. That year's crime bill wasn't the only reason those changes took place, or perhaps even the main one. What it did do, however, was move the country, with fractious but bipartisan support, in the right direction: of more policing and tougher enforcement and a powerful refusal to continue defining criminal deviancy down in the face of those who said we just had to take it. It was an act of moral clarity married to political possibility, which is what statesmanship is all about.
The result is a vastly safer country. That Mr. Biden played a major role in it is something for him to trumpet, not apologize for.
Side effects? There have been a few. There may be a case that long prison terms cripple the lives and prospects of offenders, with disproportionate consequences for racial minorities. But locking up violent offenders (whose victims are also, disproportionately, racial minorities) creates a far greater margin of safety for those who don't disobey the law.
There are also plenty of stories of aggressive, abusive and sometimes trigger-happy policing. But there's also mounting evidence that under-policing hits minority communities much harder than over-policing. Just look at Baltimore, city of discouraged cops, terrified residents - and a record-high homicide rate.
As for the political criticism, Mr. Biden can shrug off Mr. Trump's cheeky tweet that "African Americans will not be able to vote for you," because it only reminds voters that Mr. Trump sees him as his most formidable rival. Besides, it was support from the Congressional Black Caucus that helped get the bill passed in the first place.
But the former vice president would be smart to take on the barbs from the left, especially from people like Bill de Blasio. The progressive New York mayor could never have been elected to his current office (much less aspired to a higher one) had 25 years of ever-lower crime not made New Yorkers remarkably nonchalant about the need for safe streets. "Makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep," as Kipling wrote, is the pastime of people who lack either the wit to recognize the source of their good fortune or the decency to be grateful for it. Or, in Mr. de Blasio's case, both.
Meanwhile, violent crime in East New York seems to be rising again. Mr. Biden ought to pay a visit. He can say: We saved communities like this once before, by being tough and smart in the face of naysayers from both parties. He should add: On his watch, he'll never risk losing them again.

My family and I would like to express our gratitude for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share our story and aid in our healing. I'm well aware that bad things happen to good people every day and they just get on with their lives, but God saw fit to place all of you special people in our paths at just His appointed time to create the masterpiece I saw.
You may never completely understand what you've helped restore in my children; I will forever be indebted to you all. You helped restore their hope for a tomorrow, a belief that there is peace behind the pain and a true silver lining in all dark clouds.

Texto completo: Headnote 2020 ELECTION
Joe Biden's presidential campaign is naming Rep. Cedric Richmond to a major leadership role within the organization, a move that could bolster Biden's standing "with some congressional Democrats and African-American leaders in politically important states, "even as the former vice president faces scrutiny over his record on criminal justice issues.
Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat and former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, will be the first national co-chairman of the Biden campaign. He has extensive political contacts in significant presidential primary states, including South Carolina, which is one of the first to vote and is crucial to the hopes of multiple 2020 contenders.
Even before joining the campaign, Richmond, in his fifth term in Congress, was a vocal supporter of Biden, despite his relationships with two CBC members who are also running for president: Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker.
In an interview with The Times this week, Richmond, 45, discussed the controversy over Biden's support of the 1994 crime bill, why he thinks the Democratic Party talks too much about millionaires and how he chose among several friends running for president.
This interview has been edited and condensed.
Q: Tell us about what you'll be doing.
A: My biggest strength is offering political advice and using my political instincts to come up with strategy, and not just strategy in the African-American community. I think the real strength is in the South and other parts of the country.
Q: How do you plan to help the vice president in South Carolina specifically?
A: He's put together a good South Carolina team, and I do have some experience down there, just from being so close to (the House majority whip James E.) Clyburn, and some other political people down there.
I don't think it's going to be based upon my relationships in South Carolina or throughout the South, but when you're an African-American congressperson from the Southern states, generally you're the congressman for all Democrats in the state because you're the only one.
People in the South are understanding that we have to elect somebody who wants to invest in the people, which means job training, it means education, it means job creation.
Q: A lot of Democrats talk about those issues. What's unique to Biden?
A: One, he has a track record. And two, I don't think it's something a lot of Democrats talk about. We talk about free college tuition, we may talk about free junior college. But the party as a whole has not zeroed in, I don't think, on all of those kitchen table issues. We did a much better job in the midterms, which is why we won so many seats.
We get caught up in, "The millionaires have to do more so that we can improve everybody else's quality of life." Well, that's true, but we're not talking to that regular mom that is struggling to make sure that her kid can go to a good school, live in a safe neighborhood.
Q: A number of your CBC colleagues have said they are torn between supporting Biden, or supporting Sens. Kamala Harris or Cory Booker. How did you think through that decision?
A: They are both friends of mine and I respect them both and I think that they are really effective senators, and I think they're both people of high moral standards. So my endorsement of Joe Biden is by no means a reflection of who they are and how effective or good they are.
I've been recruiting the vice president to run almost immediately since (Hillary) Clinton lost.
One, because I thought his body of work was that of a person I'd want to see as president. Two, because I thought he was the best person to take on President Donald Trump and beat him. And then three, from Day 1, restore our credibility around the world, and start to unify a very divided - a very, very divided - country.
Q: Do you expect the vice president to offer more specifics on issues like climate?
A: Absolutely. It's amazing to me to watch everyone now say that they are, quote-unquote "progressive" and "this is the litmus test for progressives," but everything they're talking about the vice president, they are issues he's already been on.
It was '86 he introduced a climate change bill. He led our efforts in the Paris accord. So he has a body of work on that issue before it became popular.
Q: Any sense of when that climate plan is coming?
A: I think it's in the next couple of weeks.
Q: Biden has been criticized for saying the 1994 crime bill, which he supported, did not generate mass incarceration, though experts have said it did contribute. Does he need to clarify?
A: He should give a long interview or policy statement on the crime bill.
It's a matter that's far too nuanced for somebody to just say, "Hey, was it a good bill, was it a bad bill?"
When people remember the climate, the times and all of those things, it puts it into a different perspective. My young activists - I love them to death, but the fact that they're young activists means that they did not grow up on the streets I grew up in.
Part of the question would be, if we did nothing, one, how would history have judged us as Congress, and what would the communities look like? And so, do I think the implementation of the bill was perfect? Far from it. In fact, the implementation did the legislation a real disservice. And so I think that's why it's important for people to have a more meaningful conversation about it, as opposed to the talking points.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Spokespeople for Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Justice Department spokespeople couldn't immediately be reached.
Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., has faced mounting scrutiny as tech companies' practices worldwide have come under the microscope over the past year. In addition to the 2017 record fine, European regulators also slapped a $1.7 billion penalty on the company in March for barring websites from selling ads from rivals alongside some Google-served ads near search results.
Google says it has now ended that practice.
The company made changes voluntarily when the FTC shut down its investigation, including letting advertisers use information from their Google ad campaigns to create campaigns with rivals.
But an FTC staff report that was released years later showed that the agency staff had urged the presidentially-appointed commissioners to bring a lawsuit against Google. That never happened.
Google commands the lead in digital ad revenue by a wide margin, controlling 31.1 percent of global digital ad dollars, according to eMarketer's 2019 estimates. Facebook is a distant second with 20.2 percent.
Politicians and outside antitrust analysts have expressed concern in recent years that Google controls too much of the digital ad process. It makes the technology, hosts the largest search site where ads appear and collects data from all ad campaigns that it runs.

Texto completo: Dem presidential hopefuls flock to Calif. state party
SAN FRANCISCO -- More than a dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls flocked to California on Saturday for the chance to make their cases to thousands of activists in the nation's largest liberal stronghold during a three-day gathering of the state party.
California's own Sen. Kamala Harris looked to make a show of force in the prime first speaking slot to kick off the day's main event, and her campaign even emblazoned the official convention lanyards with her name. But it was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren who electrified the crowd the most among the early morning speakers, bringing the Democratic Party's most faithful voters to their feet repeatedly as she pledged bold action.
"Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses," Warren said in a thinly veiled shot at former Vice President Joe Biden, who has expressed hope the GOP will have "an epiphany" after President Donald Trump is gone. "But our country is in a crisis. The time for small ideas is over."
Biden was the only major candidate not attending the weekend gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio.
A man described as an animal-rights activist disrupted a panel at which Harris, D-Calif., spoke, snatching a microphone out of the presidential candidate's hand as she looked on in surprise.
Harris stepped aside as the man tried to speak and organizers tried to stop him.
He was quickly restrained by several men.
"We need to begin impeachment proceedings and we need a new commander in chief!" she declared.

Acting Pentagon chief slams China's tech policy in speech
SINGAPORE -- U.S. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Saturday denounced China's efforts to steal technology from other nations and militarize man-made outposts in the South China Sea as a "tool kit of coercion," saying activities by Beijing the U.S. perceives as hostile must end.
In his first major speech on the international stage, Shanahan mixed sharp criticism of China and warnings of North Korea's "extraordinary" threat with vows that the U.S. will remain strongly committed to the Indo-Pacific region and is ready to invest billions of dollars in securing its stability.
While he didn't specifically name China in early parts of his speech, he made clear who his target was, making pointed references to Beijing's campaign to put advanced weapons systems on disputed islands in the region.

Justice Department preparing to investigate Google practices
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department is readying an investigation of Google's business practices and whether they violate antitrust law, according to news reports.
The search giant was fined a record $2.72 billion by European regulators in 2017 for abusing its dominance of the online search market. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission made an antitrust investigation of Google but closed it in 2013 without taking action.
Now the Justice Department has undertaken an antitrust probe of the company's search and other businesses, according to reports by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Bloomberg News. They cited unnamed people familiar with the matter.
Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Officials: 79 people injured in blast at Russia explosives plant
MOSCOW -- Russia's health ministry says 79 people have been injured in an explosion in a plant manufacturing TNT.
The blast took place Saturday in Dzerzhinsk, 250 miles east of Moscow. An investigation is underway but the cause of the blast has not been determined.
The ministry said 38 employees at the plant and 41 local residents sought treatment after the blast. It said 15 were hospitalized, one in serious condition.
The blast broke windows in about 180 residential buildings near the plant, the state news agency Tass reported.
Dmitry Krasnov, deputy governor of the region that includes Dzerzhinsk, said earlier on state TV that two people were missing in the blast, but later said that information had not been confirmed.

Judge orders captain arrested in Danube sinking
BUDAPEST, Hungary -- A Hungarian judge on Saturday ordered the formal arrest of a captain whose Viking river cruise ship collided with a sightseeing boat on the Danube River, sinking the tourist boat and leaving seven South Koreans dead and 21 people missing.
Authorities said water levels in Budapest are expected to fall quickly in the coming days, helping efforts to salvage the wreckage that may still contain victims' bodies.
The judge ordered the 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn cruise ship formally arrested for 30 days. He said the captain could be released on bail -- subject to him wearing a tracking device and remaining in Budapest -- but prosecutors are appealing that decision.
Divers so far have been unable to even approach the wreckage.

In speech to leaders, Saudi king slams Iranian attacks
MECCA, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia's King Salman slammed Iran over recent attacks targeting the kingdom, describing the incidents on Saturday in a speech before Muslim leaders gathered in Mecca as "terrorist acts" that threaten global energy supplies.
It was the monarch's strongest words yet since tensions spiked in recent weeks between the two regional heavyweights.
Iran had a representative present at the 57-nation summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, but its top leadership did not attend.
The Islamic summit drew political figures and heads of state from countries spanning Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
They come with widely varying policies and priorities, but share a common reverence for the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem.

Lunch with Buffett: An anonymous bidder has offered more than $4.5 million to have a private lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, shattering the previous record of nearly $3.5 million. An online auction that raises money for the Glide Foundation's work to help the homeless in San Francisco ended Friday night with a winning bid of $4,567,888. It's the 20th year the Berkshire Hathaway CEO has participated in the pricey lunch auction, giving the winner the chance to talk with the renowned investor and philanthropist. Bidding starts at $25,000. Buffett has raised nearly $30 million for the charity over the years. The winning bidder and up to seven friends get to dine with Buffett.

Ruppersberger: NSA says 'EternalBlue' hacking tool not factor in Baltimore ransomware attack

Texto completo: The National Security Agency told Rep. C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger on Friday that a hacking tool the agency is believed to have created was not a factor in the Baltimore ransomware attack, the congressman said.
The agency's contention that the EternalBlue tool wasn't used in the incident contradicts a New York Times report published May 25. The Times cited security experts briefed on the case and reported that "a key component of the malware that cybercriminals used in the attack" was developed by the NSA.
"I have been told that there is no evidence at this time that EternalBlue played a role in the ransomware attack currently affecting Baltimore city," Ruppersberger said in a statement. "I'm told it was not used to gain access nor to propagate further activity within the network."
Following the Times report, Democratic Mayor Bernard C. "Jack" Young and Democratic City Council President Brandon Scott said they would seek federal money to cover some portion of the estimated $18.2 million the attack will cost the city.
Lester Davis, a spokesman for Young, declined to say whether the city's investigators had found any evidence of the tool being used, citing an ongoing federal investigation into the incident.
The NSA and FBI declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for the Times said the paper was confident about the accuracy of its initial report and in a new article published late Friday, the Times provided more detail about the Baltimore incident. The paper reported that people directly involved in the Baltimore investigation said four contractors hired by the city had found EternalBlue in the city's systems.
"The leading theory is that hackers broke in through an open server in Baltimore's network, installed a back door and then used EternalBlue to move across the city's computers searching for valuable servers to infect," the Times reported.
Contractors discovered an additional tool called a "web shell" on the city's network that investigators believe might have been used in conjunction with EternalBlue and another hacking technique, the Times reported.
EternalBlue, which relies on a vulnerability in Microsoft software, was posted online in 2017 by a group calling itself the Shadowbrokers. The NSA has never acknowledged creating EternalBlue, but security experts and former agency employees have said they're confident the leaked tool originated with the spy agency.
The leak renewed a debate about whether and when the NSA should disclose security flaws it discovers. The agency can use them to gain intelligence to protect the country, but keeping the flaws secret runs the risk that criminals or foreign governments also know about them and can use them to attack computers in the U.S.
Microsoft issued a patch in 2017 to resolve the vulnerability. That led some experts to blame Baltimore's IT teams for leaving the city vulnerable two years later, if EternalBlue was involved.
The Times story prompted Ruppersberger, a Democrat whose district includes the NSA headquarters, and other members of Maryland's congressional delegation to seek briefings from the NSA.
Scott issued a statement late on May 25, calling on Republican Gov. Larry Hogan to ask federal authorities to declare the ransomware attack a federal disaster, which would unlock funding. On Friday, Scott said he stood by his call for help from the federal government.
Asked whether he knew if the NSA-linked tool was used in the incident, Scott said a cybersecurity committee he appointed would get to the bottom of the issue.
"We aim to get answers about everything related to the event, from the origin to the rebuild," Scott said.
Rob Joyce, a senior NSA official, discussed the Times article in oblique terms Thursday at a conference in Washington.
"The characterization that there's an indefensible nation-state tool propagating ransomware is simply untrue," Joyce said, according to news site NextGov.
"Focusing on a single exploit, especially one that has a solution through a patch that was issued years ago, is really shortsighted," he said. "Vulnerabilities will continue to be found. Doing the basics is required for responsible network administration."
In his statement, Ruppersberger said that even if the leaked tools were not used in Baltimore, the federal government needs to do more to help local governments bolster their defenses.

Texto completo: ‘Life Here’ column helped understand racism’s pain
With deep appreciation to Deb Beaupre for sharing her feelings upon seeing a Confederate flag in the middle of a field, otherwise gorgeous. (“Life Here: The Valley is beautiful, except for this symbol,” May 25).
As another human being, I am sickened by the presence of that flag, and even more sickened by the fact that you had to experience it. There are times when I want to scream. Being from New Jersey, I was used to being among folks of all colors. I also love the natural beauty of this area, but I am desperately missing the beauty of the diversity I knew and loved back there.
I treasure the times I go to visit my children in places like Washington, D.C., and San Jose, Calif., and can be saturated in diversity. Surely I am not the only white person who is grief-stricken and livid by the insensitivity demonstrated by others, in ways such as this. Reading Beaupre’s column is the best way I can think of to begin to understand the pain and fear caused by such actions. I am so very sorry.

A blindness to implicit biases
Thank you so much for the “Life Here” column by Deb Beaupre, describing her experiences in the Upper Valley as a woman of color (“The Valley is beautiful, except for this symbol,” May 25).
I am a person of European descent, walking with the privilege granted me because of my skin color. Until recently, I was mostly blind to the ways my experiences and worldview vary from those of people of color. In my blindness, I carried implicit (unconscious) biases about people of color, and I was unaware of the stress that everyday racism inflicts on them. I am not talking about white nationalists and hate groups (though we know they are here.) I am talking about well-meaning folks who clutch their handbags and lock their car doors when traveling in “sketchy” areas, about the assumption that racial bias in policing does not exist, about the belief that good people can’t do and say racist things, about people who think that talking about racism makes it worse, and people who think, “If everyone would just be kind to each other, there wouldn’t be a problem.”
I used to believe those things. And I still say and do things that are hurtful and racist, not with bad intent, but out of ignorance and blindness.
I am very grateful to folks in marginalized groups who tell me of these harms so I can apologize and try to do better. I have learned a lot about the laws that were enacted after Reconstruction with the explicit purpose of oppressing black people and others, preventing them from voting, from acquiring wealth, from being treated equally by the legal system. I still feel guilty and ashamed to be a participant and beneficiary of this system, and I have found that the best way to respond is to take action. By educating myself and others, I hope the day will come when my beloved country will truly offer equal opportunity to all.
Deb Beaupre, I hope you will stay in the Upper Valley. I also understand why you’d want to leave.

Please don’t leave the Valley
Deb Beaupre wrote a heartfelt piece on the beauty of the Upper Valley marred by the occasional presence of Confederate flags and the implications of racism (“Life Here: The Valley is beautiful, except for this symbol,” May 25). I hope that doesn’t drive her back to the safe anonymity of the city.
All that flag means is someone has made an emotional commitment to remain ignorant. So stay and keep talking and writing and letting us know how you feel. Ignorance is allergic to knowledge.

Of news deserts and our eroded democracy
Valley News Digest, a collaboration with public access station CATV, provides a monthly opportunity to watch Valley News editors, reporters and photographers talk about their work. Glad to see it on channel 8, and also on the newspaper’s website.
Speaking of cable television, Sinclair Broadcast Group is back in the news (“Sinclair Broadcast acquires 21 regional sports networks,” May 7).
This time its gambit to desertify our nation’s newscasts relies on acquiring these sports networks from Disney for $10.6 billion. “We will become the preeminent local news and sports provider in the country,” Sinclair CEO Chris Ripley said in an interview. “Local”? Disney was forced to sell the networks by the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns. How’s that jibe with Ripley’s boast?
Bad as news desertification may seem, I think it pales in comparison with the erosion of democracy under the regime of President Donald Trump. Fortunately, we may be at a tipping point, with former Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin urging Congress not to hesitate in using “inherent contempt” to jail Attorney General William Barr and others for failing to comply with its subpoenas. I bet there are other mechanisms to bring this evil regime to an end. Thanks also to The New York Times for revealing Trump’s embarrassing $1.17 billion in business losses between 1985 and 1994.
So it’s time to impeach the illegitimate dotard’s appointed circuit court judges (and the two Supreme Court ones). We must prevent Trump’s setting precedent and restore net neutrality and abortion rights at the federal levels.
We must promote voting rights, drop the Electoral College and adopt ranked-choice voting for municipal, state and federal offices, and for passing laws at all levels. Most of all, we need a Green New Deal and its implementation ... or I’ll keep marching across the Connecticut (9:30, most mornings).

Family dinner does wonders
Last week, an acquaintance informed me that her family has supper together every evening. How refreshing. That reminded me of my early years, when we watched very little television, listened to very little radio and, as kids, didn’t have watches. A mother would step onto her porch and yell, “Billy, suppertime.” Billy would stop what he was doing and race home. Most of us kids in neighborhood adhered to a similar routine, and we couldn’t go back outside until we’d finished dinner and performed any after-supper tasks. My brother and I washed and dried the dishes to the satisfaction of the one-person quality control department.
There was one menu, and it consisted of what was on our plates. I detested beets (I love them now) but I could not leave the table until I had consumed them. My buddy Allen disliked peas (his grandmother called them pea-z). Allen ate the darn things as a condition of parole from the table.
The tradition of family dinner is an edifying ritual. Joys are shared, disputes are set aside (or abided), and we develop a relationship with food and the function of the household. Some days it’s pleasure and some days it’s peas, but every day it’s shared.
This may be nostalgia for a rite lost to our age of hyperactivity, but family dinner — even just four nights a week — might do wonders for a household. Two new rules for our time: No electronic devices, and turn off the TV.

Resilience she now shares
Jennifer Pastiloff has battle wounds from losing her father at an early age and grappling with an eating disorder and hearing loss. But she has used her pain to teach resilience to others with yoga-based workshops that sell out around the world. And she wrote "On Being Human: A Memoir of Waking Up, Living Real, and Listening Hard." She and her friend and fellow examiner of the human condition, "The Chronology of Water" author Lidia Yuknavitch, will discuss the memoir.

Meeting some pioneers of pride
Before there was Pete Buttigieg, an openly gay candidate for president, there were scores of quietly extraordinary people -- Army colonels, Cuban immigrants, nightclub owners -- who fought personal and public battles for the right to proudly exist in the hetero-normative world. Mason Funk, founder and executive director of Outworlds, a nonprofit that documents the history of LGBTQ people all over the United States, shines a light on 75 elders and pioneers in "The Book of Pride: LGBTQ Heroes Who Changed the World."

Texto completo: Americans who wish to read the findings of the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III already have a wealth of options. This week, two different published versions of the report appear in the top ten on Amazon's best-seller list; Google around and you'll find an untold number of outlets (including The New York Times) offering digital versions. There are even audiobooks.
But an upcoming version might be most dramatic of them all.
Beginning Saturday night and running through Sunday, the theater companies New Neighborhood and Slightly Altered States, along with the arts and media company DMNDR, will host a 24-hour public reading of the Mueller report in Queens. "Filibustered and Unfiltered: America Reads the Mueller Report" will take place at the Arc, a Long Island City venue.
The director Jackson Gay conceived the project, which started as her half-serious Facebook post but has grown into an event with over 100 volunteer readers. Participants are scheduled to include the theater directors Anne Kauffman, Leigh Silverman and Annie Dorsen; Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater; the actor Michael Urie; and the playwrights and performers Taylor Mac and Eisa Davis. Mac's own marathon show, "A 24-Decade History of Popular Music," became a 24-hour-long must-see in 2016.
Ms. Gay said musicians will play during some portions of the report that have been redacted. Yet despite the music, and the heavy participation of theater-world figures, the intention isn't to dramatize, she added.
"It's not meant to be a performance," she explained. "It's meant to be a bunch of people coming together and finding their voice. We shouldn't just sit back on our couches and let other people tell us what to think."
In this way, the Mueller reading differs from another recent government document performance, "Is This a Room: Reality Winner Verbatim Transcription," in which the theater company Half Straddle turned an F.B.I. transcript into a stage play at the Kitchen in January.
This weekend's reading was announced before Mr. Mueller's televised public remarks Wednesday about the special counsel's Russia investigation, but Ms. Gay said she sees it as a fitting response: "He was basically in every way possible saying, 'Could everyone just read the report?' That's the main thing I got."
"It's really just about our responsibility as American citizens to read this thing that we paid for," she added.

It's rush hour on Mount Everest

Texto completo: "The plain truth," author Jon Krakauer wrote, "is that I knew better but went to Everest anyway."
It was 1996. Krakauer, a correspondent for Outside magazine, was to hike to Mount Everest's base camp and write a story for the publication. Instead, he met the guides who helped pioneer the commercial climbing business on the world's highest peak and convinced the magazine to let him climb to the top. His editors obliged.
By the end of his trip, eight climbers had died during a storm. At the time, it was the deadliest attempted ascent on the mountain.
Eleven people have died on Everest this year, in large part because of the vast contingent of unqualified and unguided alpinists who now flock to the mountain during climbing season, the very phenomenon Krakauer went to document.
Three years before his trip, life on Everest changed, but to understand that, you have to understand the mountain's history.
British climbers made early attempts to reach the peak on the northern side of the summit in Tibet in the early 20th century. George Mallory and Andrew Irvine were spotted within hundreds of feet of the top in 1924, but the two never returned to camp to relay whether they had made it. Mallory's body was found in 1999. Irvine's remains missing.
Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay made the first official ascent in 1953 from the mountain's southern side, in Nepal. The first Americans reached the peak in 1963. The group included Barry Bishop, who wrote about and photographed the trip for National Geographic.
But amid the Cold War, access to the mountain was severely restricted. China closed the Tibetan portion of Everest from 1950 to 1980. Nepal for years did not allow foreigners into the country to climb Everest unless they were accompanied by scientists, and when it finally opened its border in 1985, it issued one Everest permit per season per route.
By the 1990s, international tensions had eased and more qualified alpinists began showing up at the mountain, hoping to gain access to climb.
"Everest, you could always get a permit, but you had to be sponsored by your country's climbing agency," Todd Burleson, founder and president of guide service Alpine Ascents International, said in a phone interview. He has led two guided journeys to Everest's summit, and he said aspiring climbers used to wait several years until their turn for a permit arrived.
"Up until about 1990, you'd take a group of the best climbers from your country to Everest, and if one of those climbers got to the top, you were a national success," he said. "But during the '90s we learned a lot, and there were a lot of people who couldn't get on those groups who were very skilled. And then we started bringing them to the mountain."
Sensing opportunities for revenue and fresh off an economic modernization, China began granting more permits. Then Nepal liberalized the permitting process, too, to keep up. Fewer than 2,000 people attempted to climb the mountain in the 1980s, according to the Himalayan Database, but nearly 4,000 have tried each of the past two decades.
"In 1993 the world changed completely," said Eric Simonson, who is a director for International Mountain Guides and has reached Everest's summit multiple times.
Guiding agencies such as Adventure Consultants and Mountain Madness, the subjects of Krakauer's 1997 book, "Into Thin Air," began leading trips up Everest. Local Sherpas, who experienced mountaineers say are excellent climbers but sometimes unqualified guides, established companies that offered trips at less than half the cost, but not every agency did a thorough vetting of clients to see whether they were physically capable of scaling Everest.
And so larger and larger crowds arrived at the mountain as the services at base camp improved, aided by technology and more precise weather tracking that allowed climbers to reach the peak in more predictably safe conditions.
But the cluster of people on the mountain is dangerous, too, sometimes preventing swift evacuations and cramming climbers together on perilous slopes.
By 1996, one of the world's most remote locales was becoming a tourist attraction. Krakauer, an avid climber, arrived to tell that story.
He reached the summit May 10, then returned to a forward base camp. As he descended, the weather turned, and dozens of climbers from three groups were stuck in a traffic jam and exposed to the hurricane-strength storm. So many climbers assaulted the summit at once - even after delays in securing ropes along the treacherous "death zone" at an elevation of some 26,000 feet - that they couldn't turn around in a timely fashion and retreat for cover.
Eight climbers died, including three guides.
"The commercialized trips and the overcrowding were what caused the tragedy [in 1996]," Hillary, who died in 2008, told Time magazine in 2003. "It was inevitable. I've been forecasting a disaster of that nature for some time. And it will happen again. You see, with so many climbers on the mountain, climbers are practically queuing up for the difficult parts. What happens then, quite a few don't get to the top till 3 or later in the afternoon. And then, like in this instance, the late weather comes sweeping in."
Krakauer wrote about the tragedy for Outside, then turned the article into a book that made the New York Times bestsellers list and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. Sony bought its film rights nearly immediately after publication, and it was adapted into a TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest") in 1997 and a feature film ("Everest") in 2015.
(Krakauer has criticized the 2015 movie for departing from actual events on the mountain. He told the Los Angeles Times that it was "total bull." Director Baltasar Kormakur responded that his script was not based on the book.)
"I walked off of that mountain," said Burleson, who was awarded the American Alpine Club's most prestigious honor for his part in the 1996 rescue effort, "and I had phone calls from all over the world asking: 'Can I climb Everest? Can I climb Everest?' Before that, there were only a few of us, and we knew what we were doing. But now everybody wanted to do it."
"The '96 tragedy, Jon Krakauer's book, the Mallory expedition [when Mallory's body was found in 1999], blogging, it crossed over from just climbers being interested to everybody being interested," Simonson said. "The audience exponentially increased."
The new demand for Everest expeditions outpaced the supply, especially from the mostly Western guide agencies that had offered such services, said Alan Arnette, an Everest expert, summit coach and blogger.
Those firms typically took small groups, often no more than 10 clients, and brought along up to four guides with several more Sherpas, who help fasten ropes and haul gear. Since acclimatizing to Everest's elevation can take days and the climbing is slow going, the average Everest quest takes close to two months and costs around $70,000.
Other guide agencies emerged and began leading larger trips at lower prices without requiring climbers to have certain experience, experts said, and the mountain got even more crowded. And as more underqualified adventurers attempted to reach the peak, Everest was normalized as a tourist destination.
"If you have the money, you can go," Burleson said. "That's pretty much what's happened."
To Krakauer, who declined an interview for this story, the allure of climbing one of the world's most dangerous mountains has always defied logic.
"Attempting to climb Everest is an intrinsically irrational act - a triumph of desire over sensibility," he wrote in the introduction of "Into Thin Air." "Any person who would seriously consider it is almost by definition beyond the sway of reasoned argument."
