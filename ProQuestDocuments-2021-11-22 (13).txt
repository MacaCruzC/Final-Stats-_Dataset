Texto completo: BAGHDAD — Protesters broke into the heavily guarded compound of the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday and set fires inside in anger over US airstrikes that killed 24 members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend.
The men did not enter the main embassy buildings and later withdrew from the compound, joining thousands of protesters and militia fighters outside chanting “Death to America," throwing rocks, covering the walls with graffiti, and demanding that the United States withdraw its forces from Iraq.
The situation remained combustible, with the crowd vowing to camp indefinitely outside the sprawling compound, the world's largest embassy. Their ability to storm the most heavily guarded zone in Baghdad suggested that they had received at least tacit permission from Iraqi security officials sympathetic to their demands.
President Trump, faced with scenes of unfolding chaos at a US embassy, lashed out against Iran, which he blamed for the protests.
“Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities," he said in a tweet. “They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!"
He spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi about the need to protect Americans and US facilities, a White House statement said.
Roughly 750 additional US troops will deploy to the region immediately, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said late Tuesday. “This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities," he said. The troops are likely to deploy to Kuwait.
Those soldiers are in addition to 14,000 US troops who have deployed to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression, including its alleged sabotage of commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also spoke by telephone with Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih in separate calls, and “made clear the United States will protect and defend its people," according to a summary of the call from the State Department. It said that the Iraqi leaders “assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility" to safeguard American officials and property.
The State Department said that US personnel were safe and that there were no plans to evacuate the embassy. The ambassador, Matt Tueller, had been traveling and was not at the embassy when it was breached Tuesday.
The US airstrikes Sunday have resulted in the most serious political crisis in years for the United States in Iraq, stoking anti-Americanism and handing an advantage to Iran in its competition for influence in the country.
The airstrikes targeted an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, which the United States accused of carrying out a missile attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor and wounded US and Iraqi service members. A spokesman for the militia denied involvement in the attack.
But the size of the US response — five strikes in Iraq and Syria that killed two dozen fighters and wounded dozens of others — prompted condemnation from across the political spectrum in Iraq and accusations that the United States had violated Iraqi sovereignty. It also drew sharp criticism and serious threats of reprisals from Iraq's Iranian-backed militias.
The fact that the Iraqi government permitted militia members to enter the fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, allowing the protest to happen, demonstrated Iran's powerful influence as well as the government's difficulty in controlling the militias.
But the Iraqi leadership's success in averting a deeper incursion into the embassy compound and preventing any confrontation with US personnel suggested that the government may have intended to allow the militias to vent their anger with minimal damage.
The US military made a show of force in response to the turmoil, with helicopter gunships circling overhead. From inside the compound, loudspeakers warned the crowd outside to keep away.
The Pentagon sent 120 Marine reinforcements to Baghdad from Kuwait, roughly the same number sent to the embassy in 2014, when the Islamic State was threatening Baghdad.
The protest began Tuesday morning when thousands of militia members gathered outside the Green Zone after prayer services for the fighters killed in the US strikes.
While few of them were armed, many were members of Kataib Hezbollah and other fighting groups that are technically overseen by the Iraqi military. Kataib Hezbollah is separate from the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, although both groups are backed by Iran and oppose the United States.
When the protesters pushed toward the entrance to the Green Zone, a heavily guarded district of government offices and embassies in central Baghdad, the Iraqi security forces did not stop them.
Their accession to the protesters was a marked contrast to their treatment of the antigovernment protesters who have been demonstrating outside the Green Zone for months. Those protesters were met with tear gas and bullets and have not been able to enter the Green Zone.
Once at the US Embassy, the protesters on Tuesday used long poles to shatter security cameras. They covered the compound walls with anti-American graffiti and set a guardhouse on fire.
After breaking open a compound entrance, dozens of men entered and lit more fires while embassy security guards watched them from the embassy roof and fired tear gas.
One group of protesters ended up separated from US troops by only a pane of glass, according to a video shared on social media. It was not immediately clear how many Americans were inside the compound.
The embassy complex, which opened in 2009 and cost an estimated $736 million to build, covers 104 acres, nearly as big as Vatican City, the world's smallest country.
The embassy and an American consulate in Irbil, in northern Iraq, now have a combined staff of 486 people, with the majority in Baghdad.
The scenes there Tuesday stirred memories of the seizure of two searing, politically consequential events in recent US history: the seizure of the embassy and 52 hostages in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and the assault on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.
As a congressman, Pompeo became a political star among Republicans for blistering criticism of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, over the Benghazi attack.
Trump also had Benghazi in mind, calling the Baghdad attack “the anti-Benghazi."
The protesters eventually left the Baghdad compound, but some climbed on top of adjacent buildings, where they planted militia flags. Iraqi police and military personnel eventually arrived at the scene, but they did not disperse the protesters.
While the protesters carried the flags of Iraq and a range of militia groups, the most prominent was that of Kataib Hezbollah, the group targeted by the United States.
A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, Mohammed Muhi, said his group intended to erect tents in the street in front of the US Embassy for an opened-ended sit-in to pressure the Americans to leave Iraq.
About 1,000 militia members remained camped out in front of the embassy overnight.

Oh swell. The Republican Senate’s so-called “moderates,” who combine big talk with little action and fuse noble rhetoric with hapless inertia, appear to be readying themselves for another year of deeming certain Trump desecrations as “unhelpful” or “unwise.”
One member of this club — which I call the Fellowship of the Furrowed Brow — spoke up earlier this week. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she’s “disturbed” that Mitch McConnell is colluding backstage with the legal team of defendant Donald Trump in advance of his Impeachment trial in the Senate.
Mainstream media outlets think this is big news. According to The New York Times, it’s “a potentially significant crack in Republican unity.” We’ll see. To me, it sounds like the Furrowed Brow Fellowship’s standard sponginess, the kind we’ve been getting for the past three years from Murkowski and Republican Senate colleagues like Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Rob Portman and Lamar Alexander.
First they mouth honeyed words, then (far more often than not) they vote with Trump and abet his abuses.
It’s nice that Murkowski is “disturbed” that McConnell has “confused” the trial process. But it would truly serve the public interest if she and her furrowed-brow brethren denounced McConnell’s goal of granting Trump a speedy exoneration. Under Senate rules, 51 senators (all 47 caucusing Democrats and a mere 4 Republicans) can set the terms of that trial.
That’s what conservative Trump critics would love to see. Bill Kristol, the longtime conservative commentator and activist, co-writing with a University of Texas academic in a right-leaning online magazine, deftly frames the issue:
“If a bipartisan group of public-spirited constitutionalists on both sides of the aisle come together, they can tell McConnell that he will only get 51 votes … if he works with them to fashion a fair process that allows for crucial documents to be compelled to be produced, and a reasonable number of witnesses to be called. ... The only way to get to that outcome is if some Senate Republicans refuse to lower themselves to be the mere agents of an unprincipled and partisan leader and instead rise to the demands of principle and statesmanship.”
“Some Senate Republicans …” He’s referring to the Fellowship of the Furrowed Brow — which, Murkowski aside, has said very little about McConnell’s determination to rig the game for Trump. Are they terrified that Trump will tweet at them? Are they scared of the grass-roots Trumpists back home? Or is it basically because their “moderate” image is overblown, given the fact that as senators they vote their party the vast majority of the time?
I’ll go with door number three. A recent vote serves as the perfect metaphor.
Back in October McConnell nominated, for a federal judgeship, a 37-year-old right-winger who’d been rated “unqualified” by the nonpartisan American Bar Association. In the ABA’s words, Justin Walker “does not presently have the requisite trial or litigation experience (and) has never tried a case as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal.”
No matter. Every member of the Furrowed Brow Fellowship — Murkowski, Romney, Sasse, Collins — voted to put Walker on the federal bench. Just as they’ve consistently abetted Trump’s far-right takeover of the bench.
Sasse, in particular, has been verbally upset with Trump for a long time, but he has voted with Trump 86 percent of the time and voted (along with Collins and then-Furrowed Browist Jeff Flake) to put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.
One would think that confronting McConnell on the impeachment trial rules, and demanding witness testimony, would be easy calls. Those are popular positions. According to the latest Morning Consult/Politico poll, Americans — by a margin of 54 to 27 percent — want the Senate to bring in additional witnesses. Independents are on board, 51 to 27 percent. Even a plurality of Republicans are on board, 43 to 38 percent. Numbers like that have apparently inspired Murkowski to deem herself “disturbed” by the prospect of a rigged exoneration.
Yes, only four Republicans are needed to ensure a real trial. But that would require them to act, so what we’re more likely to hear are various synonyms of “disturbed.”

Best places start running in Sonoma County

Texto completo: If your New Year’s resolutions include feeling healthier and more sane, a brisk run or a slow, steady jog may be the start of a new and improved you.
Running is hard, but also easy. No gym memberships are necessary. No special equipment is required. Being hung over, as some are sure to be on Jan. 1, isn’t an excuse to forgo a run. You’ll just burn alcohol fumes along the way.
That’s an old joke among long-time runners. Whether you’re a veteran or new to running, few places compare with Sonoma County and the North Bay for getting into stride.
We have trails along coastal bluffs and beneath towering redwoods, backcountry roads lined with vineyards and mountaintops where hard effort is rewarded with jaw- dropping vistas.
Some runners have a tradition of greeting the New Year by heading out before dawn and catching a sunrise, weather permitting. As one option, the eastern route at Santa Rosa’s Taylor Mountain Regional Park, rising 1,100  feet to the summit, is a good spot to watch the new day and year begin.
A headlamp or other light source is a must for running in the dark. Wirecutter, the New York Times consumer guide, recommends the Black Diamond Spot. For visibility, consider the Tracer360 vest made by noxgear.
If daylight and the energy of crowds is more your thing, there are local options for that, too. In Santa Rosa, the Phaby-Gray Resolution Run sponsored by the Empire Runners Club is a popular New Year’s Day draw, with more than 300 runners expected this year.
The 5K event, now in its 41st year, is held at A Place to Play Park in downtown Santa Rosa. Sign up at empirerunners.org.
“I love running this race and then going out to the coast on a nice day,” said Andrea Guzman, who lives in Santa Rosa and works in Napa for the Napa Valley Wine Train.
Guzman’s favorite off-road course is the 3.8-mile North Sonoma Mountain Ridge Trail from Sonoma Mountain Road to Jack London State Historic Park. The trail offers a fantastic 180-degree view of northern Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa Plain.
She also loves running Riverfront Regional Park in Windsor, with its peaceful quarry ponds lined by trees. Whenever possible, she runs with her dog, a lab and pit bull mix and a great long distance runner.
Guzman’s goal for 2020 is to run at Tolay Lake Regional Park southeast of Petaluma. The recently opened park offers 11 miles of trails through a canvas of grasslands and cattle country. It’s like stepping back in time to an era before vineyards and large-scale development.
Another New Year’s Day option is the Napa Valley Resolution Run just over the mountains in Yountville.The event, sponsored by the Athletic Feat running and biking store in Napa, features 5K and 10K courses on paved trails and roads lined by vineyards.
Sign up for this race at napavalleyresolutionrun.com.
The Santa Rosa and Yountville races begin at 10 a.m., a perfect start time for runners who need a few hours of extra sleep after a late night ringing in the new year.
“Have all that fun and then let’s run it out,” said Dame Rahal, owner of Athletic Feat.
Rahal and a friend started the Napa Valley Resolution Run on a whim in 2013. Their expectations for the first year were so low Rahal promised entrants a warm bowl of chili the morning of the event. When entries outpaced projections, the pair were forced to scramble for more cooks and food.
Chili is no longer served at the race, which has grown to include almost 500 entrants.
“It’s fun to see everyone,” Rahal said. “The sun is up and it tends to be crisp in terms of weather.”
Don’t give up.
Whether alone or in crowds, on roads or on trails, the key to sticking to a running plan is to not get discouraged. Running indeed requires effort, so think in terms of a marathon and not a sprint.
“Often we put a lot of pressure on ourselves when we run. We have to run and run fast, and if we stop and walk, we are kind of a failure,” said Ralph Purugganan, a store manager at Healdsburg Running Co.
But walking is not failure, Purugganan said. On steep or uneven terrain, such as on trails, walking can be just as efficient — and safer — than running.
Purugganan suggests newer runners go for time rather than distance, to lessen the pressure on “getting the miles in.” And take it slow, he said.
“We are so incredibly lucky in Napa and Sonoma counties,” Rahal said. “Pick a direction and for the most part, you are going to find unparalleled beauty. It’s why people visit us.”
It’s also why we run.

Texto completo: A change of address for "Chicago’s Very Own," the end of free TV for the Chicago Cubs, a doomsday prediction for the Chicago Tribune, and a wayward alligator dubbed Chance the Snapper occupied the Chicago media spotlight in 2019.
A look back at the top Chicago media stories of the year: WGN and the Cubs The $6.4 billion acquisition of Tribune Media by Dallas-based Nexstar Media Group moved ownership of "Chicago’s Very Own" WGN Channel 9 and WGN 720-AM out of Chicago for the first time since the broadcast offspring of the "World’s Greatest Newspaper" signed on in 1924. While its news operation remained intact, WGN closed the book on its 72-year run as television home of the Chicago Cubs. Along with the loss of Chicago Bulls, Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago White Sox games (which moved exclusively to NBC Sports Chicago), WGN forfeited its distinction as the only station in America to broadcast MLB, NBA and NHL games over the air for free. Somewhere, Jack Brickhouse was weeping.
Marquee Sports Network Sinclair Broadcast Group, though thwarted in an earlier bid to take over Tribune Media, teamed up with the Ricketts family to launch a regional sports channel as the exclusive home of Cubs baseball games. At first glance the Marquee Sports Network seemed like a heavenly marriage between the right-wing media giant Sinclair and the equally conservative Ricketts clan. But with a February 2020 launch date looming, Marquee ended the year without Comcast Cable onboard, without any signed talent agreements and without a clear message on how much the new network will cost cable subscribers — whether they want it or not.
Tribune ownership In what Chicago Tribune writer Steve Johnson called "a final bird flip to Chicago journalism from Michael Ferro, citizen of self interest," the leading shareholder of Tribune Publishing sold all 9 million of his shares — or 25 percent of the company — to Heath Freeman’s Alden Global Capital, the New York-based slash-and-burn hedge fund known for decimating newsrooms. As Alden upped its ownership to 32 percent and took two seats on the company’s board, staffers at Tribune newspapers braced for the worst. In an open letter, columnist Mary Schmich pleaded for a benevolent billionaire or two to rescue the paper before it’s too late. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make your mark on Chicago history, to make yourself rich in honor, to be — no exaggeration — a hero," she wrote. "But hurry. History won’t wait."
Jussiegate Jussie Smollett, an actor on the drama series "Empire," staged a drama of his own when he claimed to be the victim of a racist and homophobic attack near his Chicago apartment. The ensuing search for the masked men who allegedly beat him drove law enforcement and Chicago media into a frenzy and ignited a firestorm on social media. That is until police determined Smollett had orchestrated the hoax as a publicity stunt. A media frenzy of another kind followed the decision by Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx to drop charges against Smollett for filing a false report.
Rahm as pundit While Chicago made history with the election of Lori Lightfoot as the city’s first African-American lesbian mayor, the outgoing occupant of City Hall began a new career as a media pundit. Rahm Emanuel joined ABC News as a contributor and The Atlantic as an essayist and contributing editor.
Both deals were arranged by his brother, Ari Emanuel, co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor and the model for Ari Gold on the HBO series "Entourage."
Student paper flub Journalists and people who love them were aghast when the student newspaper of Northwestern University apologized for its coverage of a political protest on campus. The editors of The Daily Northwestern published a bizarre mea culpa for posting photos of the protesters and soliciting comments from student activists. "One of the biggest problems U.S. journalists face in this day and age is how few people understand what standard newsgathering process looks like," wrote Maggie Haberman of The New York Times. "A student newspaper saying normal process is somehow a bad thing is incredibly troubling."
‘Surviving R. Kelly’ In light of a blockbuster six-part documentary series on Lifetime and a disturbing new book by crusading journalist Jim DeRogatis, the Chicago media establishment belatedly reassessed R. Kelly after a quarter century of downplaying allegations against him of sexually abusing minors.
The Grammy Award-winning R&B singer and songwriter was charged in federal and state courts with aggravated sexual abuse involving multiple victims dating back decades. Lifetime’s "Surviving R. Kelly" was named the top TV show of 2019 by the Associated Press.
Sun-Times ownership An ownership change at the Sun-Times breathed new life into the financially struggling tabloid. With an influx of capital from two key investors — Michael Sacks and Rocky Wirtz — a consortium of Chicago labor unions took a back seat in the board room. With room to grow, the Sun-Times transformed its Saturday edition into a weekly sports magazine and reasserted its strong editorial voice.
Chance the Snapper News media around the world had a field day when a 5-foot-long alligator somehow turned up in Chicago’s Humboldt Park Lagoon. Block Club Chicago broke the story of the wayward reptile and the digital news site later conducted a poll that named him Chance the Snapper. Frank Robb, the intrepid trapper who caught Chance, was hailed as local hero. By year’s end, the famous gator was happily ensconced on a farm in St. Augustine, Florida, where he became a tourist attraction in his own right.
Weigel ratings boost WCIU Channel 26, flagship of Chicago-based Weigel Broadcasting long known as "The U," changed its station identification after 25 years by affiliating with The CW Network. It marked the end of Chicago’s last fully independent and locally-owned TV operation. But Weigel hit new heights in the ratings with MeTV FM, the radio spinoff of its nostalgia network that drew loyal listeners to end of the dial (at 87.7 FM) for its perfectly executed soft-rock oldies format.
Terri Hemmert rocks Hailed as the most beloved and admired woman on Chicago radio, Terri Hemmert stepped down as midday personality on WXRT 93.1-FM, capping a 45-year career as the heart and soul of the adult album alternative station. Four months after her retirement, the Radio Hall of Famer still came in first as best radio DJ in the Chicago Reader’s annual "Best of Chicago" poll.
End of an era Among the year’s print casualties, Johnson Publishing Co., launchpad of Ebony and Jet magazines, declared bankruptcy; the Chicago Defender ceased print publication; and Tribune Publishing pulled the plug on the Spanish-language weekly Hoy. On the broadcast side, Nexstar Media discontinued CLTV, Weigel Broadcasting canceled "ABC 7 Eyewitness News on The U," Ken Davis shut down Chicago Access Network’s "Chicago Newsroom," Chicago Public Media WBEZ 91.5-FM dropped "The Morning Shift" and "Worldview," and Newsweb Radio’s northwest suburban WAIT 850-AM went dark.
Going nonprofit A different route taken by some unprofitable media companies was to restructure as nonprofits. Among them were the Chicago Reader and the West suburban Wednesday Journal newspapers. Univision Chicago and The Chicago Reporter announced plans to launch a nonprofit bilingual news collaborative targeting the Chicago area’s Latinx community.
Coppock signs off The death of Chet Coppock, 70, from injuries in a highway auto accident elicited an outpouring of grief along with indelible memories of the colorful Chicago sportscaster and pioneering sports radio host. His memorial service drew a who’s-who of the local sports community.
"I’m the first to tell you, and you can put this on my tombstone: Love me, hate me, but please react to me," Coppock once told me.
"How many people in this town do make people react? There are not too many who do."

Texto completo: The number of women serving on the boards of publicly traded companies in the Golden State soars . . . because a new law requires it. And did you know tornados aren't as rare here as you might think?
It's Arlene Martínez, here to help kick off your week with the day's must-read stories.
But first, keep the cannabis off the bus and don't forget about your REAL ID: Those and other new-to-2020 Golden State traffic laws.
In California is a roundup of stories from newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Sign up for M-F delivery here!
90% of Calif. public companies now have women directors
Starting this week, California law will require the all-male boards of publicly traded companies headquartered in the state to add at least one woman or eventually face fines. More than 90% have done it, as companies rushed in recent months to add one: Between October and December, two dozen women joined their ranks.
But as of Thursday, 25 company boards still were all male, according to Clemson University Assistant Professors Daniel Greene and Vincent Intintoli and University of Arizona Professor Kathleen Kahle, who have been tracking the issue.
Other states are considering legislation similar to California's, which by 2021 ups the number of female director requirements to two on a board of five or three on a board of six.
At least two lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the law have been filed. They argue women are headed toward parity on their own and don't need the help. Still, over 300 of the top 3,000 largest U. S. -traded stocks still have no women director representation.
Who won't be in compliance: The list includes San Jose-based A10 Networks Inc. , whose board members received between $197,000 and $348,000 in compensation in 2018. San Carlos-based Allakos, which paid its board members packages ranging from $228,000 to $420,000 in 2018, also is very sorry it won't be able to add a woman by Jan. 1 but the company is "very committed to diversity. "

25 companies that pay their board of directors a shocking amount.
Immigration, the census and the drug problem bigger than opioids
“I’m here essentially to say goodbye to my mom,” Gibram Cruz, an Army intelligence officer who took a few days off last week to say goodbye to his mother. She entered the country without documentation and is scheduled to be deported from San Diego to Mexico on Thursday.
As an interpreter for migrants who speak Mayan languages, Oswaldo Vidal Martín plays a vital role in the Bay Area: translating their cases for asylum. In-person court interpretation for such languages is rare, and the results of not having one can be devastating.
School workers across California, as "trusted messengers," are preparing to play a major role in the 2020 Census to ensure hard-to-reach populations are counted.
It isn't opioids devastating this northern California community. It's meth and alcohol.
California as a 'tornado capital'
Remember that tornado that seemed so out of place last week for SoCal? Turns out, they're not as unusual as one might think. In fact, the Golden State hosts on average of six twisters per year.
“California is actually the tornado capital of the country west of the Continental Divide,” said Bill Patzert, a retired climatologist from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “People tend to think of California weather as benign and boring, but we can have some spectacular storms. ”
The National Weather Service defines a tornado as a violently rotating column of air that touches the ground, and the U. S. tops the globe when it comes to the number of them. They can be super strong or fairly weak, like the one in Ventura County on Christmas night, which was rated as an EF0 — the lowest level on the Enhanced Fujita Scale that’s used to gauge twisters.
What else we're talking about
He said the iconic Queen Mary in Long Beach "has never been in worse condition. " A few months later, the ship's 25-year inspector lost his contract with the city.
SoCal's Trafficgate: It's never too soon to revisit that time Highway 101 became the only available north-south corridor, turning a 40-minute commute into 4. 25 hours.
A Visalia girl, age 6, decided to put what she'd learned from her investigator grandpa into action on Christmas Eve. St. Nick had other plans.
Painted utility boxes are a popular way for California cities to provide a bit of pop to an otherwise mundane necessity. But what happens when, without warning, the art is blocked by ginormous battery packs?
California, we love you but we can't live in you
His pay at a San Jose manufacturing facility tripled over the last decade. His housing costs in that time nearly quadrupled. This look inside California is a bleak picture of income inequality, an impossible housing market and getting comfortable (or not) with natural disasters.
“What’s happening in California right now is a warning shot to the rest of the country,” Jim Newton, a journalist, historian and lecturer on public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, told the New York Times. “It’s a warning about income inequality and suburban sprawl, and how those intersect with quality of life and climate change. ”
Residents aren't all willing to work through the problems with the state — they're breaking up with it. While more than 158,000 people moved to California over the 12-month period that ended July 1, more than 197,000 people left. It was the state's slowest recorded growth rate since 1900.
In San Francisco, where $1 million can buy you a shack, state flight is particularly acute.
One last thing: I'd love to hear what I can do to make this more relevant for you, what you'd like to see or who you'd like to meet in the new year. I'm all ears.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES -- Sue Lyon, the actress who was forever tied to her teenage portrayal of the title role in 1962's "Lolita," died Thursday in Los Angeles. The news was first reported by the New York Times, and no cause of death was immediately given. She was 73.
"How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita' " asked the ads for the film, director Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's controversial novel about a man in his 40s who becomes obsessed with a young girl. James Mason, Peter Sellers and Shelley Winters also starred in the film.
"From the first, she was interesting to watch," Kubrick was quoted as saying of Lyon in Look magazine. "Even in the way she walked in for her interview, casually sat down, walked out. She was cool and non-giggly. She was enigmatic without being dull. She could keep people guessing about how much Lolita knew about life."
Born July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa, Lyon was just 14 years old and had had only a few minor screen credits when she was said to beat out more than 800 other young women for the part in "Lolita." Lyon would go on to win a Golden Globe award for most promising female newcomer for her performance.
In 1964, writing in The Times, Hedda Hopper declared, "Sue Lyon is the arch prototype of an instant star."
Lyon would go on to appear in John Huston's 1964 adaptation of Tennessee Williams's "The Night of the Iguana" and John Ford's 1966 drama "7 Women." She continued to act steadily throughout the 1960s and 1970s in both film and television. Her last screen credit was in 1980's "Alligator."
Lyon was married five times, to Hampton Fancher (who would go on to be a screenwriter on "Blade Runner"), Roland Harrison, Cotton Adamson, Edward Weathers and Richard Rudman.
Adamson was a convict for second degree murder and robbery in Colorado at the time of their marriage in 1973. When they divorced only a year later, Lyon was quoted as saying, "I've been told by people in the movie business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I can't get a job because I'm married to Cotton. Therefore, right now we can't be married."
Lyon had a daughter, Nona, from her marriage to Harrison.
In a 1967 interview with The Times promoting the Frank Sinatra-starring movie "Tony Rome," Lyon, then all of 20 years old, said, "To be pretty and to stay pretty are two different things... You can't take anything for granted, and it's foolish to think you can. You have to think ahead of how to build health and happiness. You have to learn to avoid what is going to hurt you or someone else."

Y2K Survival Guides: They’re Now a Little Bit Dated

Texto completo: Twenty years ago, people completely lost their shizzle. Why? Because Y2K was just around the corner. To backtrack: On January 1, 2000, the Y2K bug was predicted to dismantle our functioning society as we knew it.
Yeah, that’s all.
SEE ALSO: 2019’s Top 7 Tech IPO Flops—And Those Set for a Major 2020 Rebound
Jumping back to this foreboding era, apparently, there was a date glitch in computer systems. The Y2K bug would take effect when the date transitioned from 1999 to 2000. What did this mean? Many computer programs only allowed two digits for the year (i.e. “99” instead of “1999”). As far as older computers were concerned, it would be 1900, not 2000.
Thus, there was immense panic that computers weren’t apt enough to roll over to four digits for the new year. Therefore, computers wouldn’t be able to operate once the new millennium went into effect.
To put it into perspective, this was back in the ancient days of tech, when human couriers, such as Johnny Mnemonic, could only carry 80 gigs of data in their head. (Apparently, this ’90s sci-fi classic didn’t foresee that advent of flash drives.)
Not to say this was overhyped, or a hoax, but the media prompted a nation of fear. People were actually freaking out. Mainstream news, such as 60 Minutes , did reports on it.
The Y2K bug was expected to result in bringing down entire computer system infrastructures, such as those for banking and power plants. Planes were expected to crash. ATM’s were to be rendered useless precisely at midnight. Food shortages were predicted to occur. Prison doors were feared to be unexpectedly opened. Nuclear missiles were to be launched on their own.
Oh yeah, there were also going to be mass riots. If you’ve seen any of the Mad Max movies, this dystopian eruption was expected to go down, where humans would then have to fight it out in an Octagon just for a loaf of bread.
The Y2K bug was labeled as a “date with disaster.” It also went by the moniker of the Millennium Bug and the Year 2000 Problem. And Y2K wasn’t cheap; it was estimated that the U.S. spent $195 billion preparing for Y2K.
Spoiler Alert: New Year’s Eve 2000 rolled in—and absolutely nothing happened.
Conspiracy theorist had a field day with the Y2K bug. Religious fanatics saw it as the end-of-days. So-called “experts” weighed in beforehand that the public was asleep, if they didn’t take precautions on the disaster that was supposed to be lurking around the corner.
A website was set up called: President’s Council on Year 2000 Conversion. A section on the X-Files- sounding site, answered: Year 2000 Rumors.
Rumors, such as whether or not the president was going to declare a national state of “martial law” for the Year 2000 transition, were quashed.
Need another example? Rumor: Most elevator computers and embedded systems will fail on January 1, 2000.
It was comforting to read that the answer to falling elevators at midnight was “false.”
The fear of the Y2K bug promoted an entire cottage industry for survivalists. The bottled water industry particularly saw a surge in sales, as people stocked piled supplies and expected the grid to go completely down. Gun sales went up in preparation for all of the looting and marauding that was to take place on American streets. (See John Carpenter’s Escape from New York for further illustration on this.)
People would actually spend money to purchase such Y2K survival kits as seen in this video, because they literally thought the entire power grid was going to go down.
A slew of documentaries were also produced leading up to Y2K. Go on YouTube and have some fun with those. Leonard Nimoy hosted the Y2K Family Survival Guide . Yes, everything you and your loved ones needed to survive this tech-pocalyse could be found in this instructional and informative VHS video—as told to you by the man who played Mr. Spock on Star Trek.
Fast Company outlined a crop of Y2K survival books that also popped up during that era to help get us through techno-doomsday. (All, which, I’m sure, were thrown immediately into the bargain bin once the date turned January 1, 2000.) Y2K survival guides became an entire literary genre.
For the most part, all books associated with Y2K have fantastical covers that could only be found this side of Scientology. If you don’t believe me, look at the cover of the book: Y2K: It’s Already Too Late .
Y2K It's Already Too Late
Seems like Dianetics would be the only thing that could save us from the Millennium Bug.
Also take a gander at: Time Bomb 2000: What the Year 2000 Computer Crisis Means to You! This gem, was not only a New York Times bestseller (in fact, there were several Y2K NYT bestsellers), but also raised all of the Y2K worst-case scenario possibilities—ranging from the collapse of the U.S. Postal Service to baseball being abandoned as America’s national pastime.
Not to say that Time Bomb 2000 is dated, but here’s the book’s description:
Not your phones, not the cash machine, not even your new VCR. All because of a short cut computer programmers took decades ago.
Realistic, practical, & terrifying…
It’s the first book for everyone who wants to survive the Year 2000 computer crisis.
Another fav was the book: Millennium Meltdown : Spiritual and Practical Strategies to Survive Y2K. The cover of the book alone had me at “hello.” The target market for Millennium Meltdown was alarmists who had little-to-no knowledge of technology.
Millennium Meltdown
The book’s description?
It is essential that we learn how to protect our family, our homes, and our finances from the approaching danger. This book will outline practical strategies to protect your family from the worst effects of the greatest technological crisis in our lifetime.
And let’s not forget the book, Y2K for Women. Yeah, why let Y2K be a man’s thing, when women could get involved as well? And, it was good to have a female perspective on the potential collapse of society. Y2K for Women also showed another angle on the Y2K hype—the religious perspective, which put the blame on heathens. The author was a Christian writer who provided tips, incited fear and linked it all to God’s judgment on us for being bad…
Finally, when technology was to crash, rioting would wreak havoc in the streets and ATMs were put to use as plant holders, one still had to eat and make delicious meals. That’s where The Y2K Survival Guide and Cookbook came into play. In summary:
An invaluable resource to prepare for any kind of disaster, be it Y2K or mother nature. It contains recipes and methods for cooking without a kitchen stove, information on buying and storing food, general supplies to have on hand, how to safely store water, how to dispose wastes when power is out, how to heat and light your home without electricity.
In the end, Y2K was an overblown chapter in American tech history, and all that remained, in its wake, was a large amount of stockpiled bottles of water, now-ironic video survival guides and an arms-length of book titles that harken back to that simpler time when Johnny Mnemonic could only hold 80 gigs in his head.

Nicholas Kristof: Why 2019 has been the best year in human history

Texto completo: html> If you’re depressed by the state of the world, let me toss out an idea: In the long arc of human history, 2019 has been the best year ever.
The bad things that you fret about are true. But it’s also true that since modern humans emerged about 200,000 years ago, 2019 was probably the year in which children were least likely to die, adults were least likely to be illiterate and people were least likely to suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases.
Every single day in recent years, another 325,000 people got their first access to electricity. Each day, more than 200,000 got piped water for the first time. And some 650,000 went online for the first time, every single day.
Perhaps the greatest calamity for anyone is to lose a child. That used to be common: Historically, almost half of all humans died in childhood. As recently as 1950, 27% of all children still died by age 15. Now that figure has dropped to about 4%.
“If you were given the opportunity to choose the time you were born in, it’d be pretty risky to choose a time in any of the thousands of generations in the past,” noted Max Roser, an Oxford University economist who runs the Our World in Data website. “Almost everyone lived in poverty, hunger was widespread and famines common.”
But … but … but President Donald Trump! But climate change! War in Yemen! Starvation in Venezuela! Risk of nuclear war with North Korea. …
All of those are important concerns, and that’s why I write about them regularly. Yet I fear that the news media and the humanitarian world focus so relentlessly on the bad news that we leave the public believing that every trend is going in the wrong direction. A majority of Americans say in polls that the share of the world population living in poverty is increasing — yet one of the trends of the last 50 years has been a huge reduction in global poverty.
As recently as 1981, 42% of the planet’s population endured “extreme poverty,” defined by the United Nations as living on less than about $2 a day. That portion has plunged to less than 10% of the world’s population now.
Every day for a decade, newspapers could have carried the headline “Another 170,000 Moved Out of Extreme Poverty Yesterday.” Or if one uses a higher threshold, the headline could have been: “The Number of People Living on More Than $10 a Day Increased by 245,000 Yesterday.”
Many of those moving up are still very poor, of course. But because they are less poor, they are less likely to remain illiterate or to starve: People often think that famine is routine, but the last famine recognized by the World Food Program struck just part of one state in South Sudan and lasted for only a few months in 2017.
Diseases like polio, leprosy, river blindness and elephantiasis are on the decline, and global efforts have turned the tide on AIDS. Half a century ago, a majority of the world’s people had always been illiterate; now we are approaching 90% adult literacy. There have been particularly large gains in girls’ education — and few forces change the world so much as education and the empowerment of women.
You may feel uncomfortable reading this. It can seem tasteless, misleading or counterproductive to hail progress when there is still so much wrong with the world. I get that. In addition, the numbers are subject to debate, and the 2019 figures are based on extrapolation. But I worry that deep pessimism about the state of the world is paralyzing rather than empowering; excessive pessimism can leave people feeling not just hopeless but helpless.
Readers constantly tell me, for example, that if we save children’s lives, the result will be a population crisis that will cause new famines. They don’t realize that when parents are confident that their children will survive, and have access to birth control, they have fewer children. Bangladesh was once derided by Henry Kissinger as a “basket case,” yet now its economy grows much faster than America’s and Bangladeshi women average just 2.1 births (down from 6.9 in 1973).
Yes, it’s still appalling that a child dies somewhere in the world every six seconds — but consider that just a couple of decades ago, a child died every three seconds. Recognizing that progress is possible can be a spur to do more, and that’s why I write this annual reminder of gains against the common enemies of humanity.
Climate change remains a huge threat to our globe, as does compassion fatigue in the rich world, and it’s likely that we will miss a U.N. target of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. Meanwhile, here in the United States, Trump presents a continuing challenge to our institutions, and millions of families have been left behind and are struggling. We should keep pressing on all these fronts (the last one concerns me enough that it’s the topic of my new book), but we’ll get a morale boost if we acknowledge the backdrop of hard-won improvement.
“We are some of the first people in history who have found ways to make progress against these problems,” says Roser, the economist. “We have changed the world. How awesome is it to be alive at a time like this?”
“Three things are true at the same time,” he added. “The world is much better, the world is awful, the world can be much better.”
I also take heart from the passion so many — especially young people — show to make the world a better place. I recently published my annual “gifts with meaning” guide and suggested four organizations to support in lieu of traditional presents. Readers have so far donated more than $1.6 million to those organizations, saving and transforming lives at home and around the world.
So I promise to tear my hair out every other day, but let’s interrupt our gloom for a nanosecond to note what historians may eventually see as the most important trend in the world in the early 21st century: our progress toward elimination of hideous diseases, illiteracy and the most extreme poverty.
When I was born in 1959, a majority of the world’s population had always been illiterate and lived in extreme poverty. By the time I die, illiteracy and extreme poverty may be almost eliminated — and it’s difficult to imagine a greater triumph for humanity on our watch.

Texto completo: Una nueva investigación periodística revela que altos cargos de la administración Trump expresaron su inquietud ante la retención de la ayuda militar a Ucrania hasta que el país del este de Europa anunciara investigaciones en contra de rivales políticos del presidente estadounidense.
El New York Times publicó el pasado domingo una descripción detallada de la consternación que habían mostrado los funcionarios que tenían que implementar las órdenes que finalmente llevaron a Trump a un juicio político este mes de diciembre.
El reportaje del Times muestra a una administración dividida entre los cargos que apoyaban la decisión de Trump de detener la ayuda y quienes cuestionaban la legalidad, moralidad y las posibles consecuencias de las intensiones del presidente.
La investigación asegura que el secretario de Defensa, Mark Esper; el de Estado, Mike Pompeo y el exasesor de seguridad nacional, John Bolton intentaron sin éxito convencer a Trump de emitir la ayuda durante una conversación que tuvieron en la oficina oval.
“Esto es por el interés del país”, diría Bolton mientras Esper trataba de hacer ver a Trump los beneficios que traería a Estados Unidos una Ucrania fuerte. Pero ninguno de los argumentos movieron un ápice la postura del presidente , que siguió ordenando la retención de la ayuda hasta que, en septiembre, cuando saltaron las alarmas de que un informante secreto había revelado el escándalo.
El Times también halló que Mick Mulvaney, jefe de gabinete y de la oficina de Administración y Presupuesto, coordinó a funcionarios para detener la ayuda. Esos mismos funcionarios se encargaron primero de negar los hechos y de culpar a otros de la administración cuando se intensificó el escrutinio en su contra.

The Primary Process Makes No Sense

Texto completo: We have an unnecessarily weak presidential field, especially the incumbent.
Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the last Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: "I know what you're thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?"
Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party's seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who's never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.
As funny as Yang's line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.
It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in The Atlantic, "a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous." It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don't want.
No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country's history. "The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process," the political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, "and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination -- the most important thing that U.S. political parties have."
The current system may seem as if it's simply an expression of democracy, but it's not. It's one version of democracy. And it's one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.
Today's leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.
How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee -- as with primaries here -- only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.
I'm not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We're left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30 percent of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.
A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.
The first change should be to the debates. The candidates' electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4 percent in a few polls.
It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.
A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.
Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn't back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.
It's also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn't give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.
The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s -- and no African-American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election -- and zero who have ever run a state.
Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn't any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.

Texto completo: Readers discuss a Frank Bruni column in which he takes a second look and views the former vice president more favorably.
To the Editor:
Re "Give Biden His Due," by Frank Bruni (column, Dec. 22):
A man of conscience, Mr. Bruni has made a course correction in his honest effort to critique the candidates. Joe Biden has consistently been demoted by most of the press. However, we find him consistently at the top of the polls. The majority of Americans are hungry for something as simple and complex as a good man. There you have it -- Joe.
Burt Sharp
Memphis
To the Editor:
I've never met a Democrat of any age who wouldn't give Joe Biden his due. But what he's not going to get is my primary vote or that of most millennial or Generation Z voters -- those of us who have to live in this country and on this planet decades beyond Mr. Biden and his inadequate, milquetoast platform.
Mr. Bruni, how low is your bar? Every Democratic candidate on the debate stage has more "fundamental generosity of spirit" and cooperative fortitude than the current occupant of the Oval Office.
The former vice president is not part of the solution; he's part of the problem, and he should stop taking money and attention away from candidates who actually will lead us forward into the America we know we can be.
Julia Smith
Naples, Fla.
To the Editor:
Of course if Joe Biden is the nominee. every thoughtful citizen should vote for him. But Frank Bruni leaves out one negative fact that we should not forget.
As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time, he was the person most responsible for putting Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court. We are still paying for this today.

Texto completo: Mr. Graham covered the Supreme Court for The New York Times during an era of intense political upheaval and racial tension before becoming CBS's law correspondent in 1972.
Fred P. Graham, a legal affairs reporter, television anchor and author who covered the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and the major trials and controversies of a tumultuous juridical era for The New York Times, CBS News and Court TV, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 88.
His wife, Skila Harris, said the cause was complications of Parkinson's disease.
The son of a Tennessee preacher, Mr. Graham, a lawyer with a soft drawl, a habitual cheroot and the steady gaze of a Mississippi riverboat gambler, was a Yale, Vanderbilt and Oxford University scholar who went to Washington in 1963 as chief counsel to Senator Estes Kefauver's subcommittee on constitutional amendments, then served two years as a special assistant to Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz.
With his legal and Washington background, Mr. Graham began life in journalism at the top in 1965, as the first lawyer hired to be The Times's Supreme Court correspondent, a job most reporters today would consider the climax of a career. In an era of racial tension and political transition, Mr. Graham brought solid legal expertise and experience in government to the task.
Blending news, analysis and background on daily deadlines, he detailed cases arising from civil rights murders in the South, free press versus privacy issues, questions over prayer in public schools and, in 1971, the Nixon administration's losing fight to suppress publication by The Times and The Washington Post of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department history of the government's duplicity in Vietnam.
In 1972, he joined CBS as the network's law correspondent. Over 15 years, he became a familiar face to Americans, pioneering coverage of Supreme Court rulings for the transitory attention of television viewers. While with CBS, he reported on the Watergate scandal; the resignation of former President Richard M. Nixon; and the legal struggles over abortion rights, racial preferences in college admissions and protections for criminal defendants.
Mr. Graham was also a substitute anchor for "Nightwatch" on CBS, the Sunday news show "Face the Nation" and the "CBS Morning News." As television news became more visual in the 1980s, with cameras still banned from courtrooms, Mr. Graham's on-air time dropped sharply. He was laid off in a CBS staff reduction in 1987. For two years, he was a local news anchor of WKRN-TV, the ABC affiliate in Nashville.
He then wrote "Happy Talk: Confessions of a TV Newsman," first published in 1990, on his two decades in broadcast journalism, in which he argued that network news programs had become "infotainment," the equivalent of "a well-produced video version of a tabloid." As Michael C. Janeway, then the dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, noted in a review for The Times Book Review, the title, "Happy Talk," referred to "that mindless banter with which television anchors fill air time."
In 1991, after a seismic change that allowed television cameras into courtrooms for live coverage of criminal trials, Mr. Graham and the legal reporter Cynthia McFadden became the first anchors of a new Courtroom Television Network, also known as Court TV. Its crime-themed programs included dramas, documentaries and live coverage of major criminal cases. It became TruTV in 2008, with a new focus on reality programs.
Interviewing experts like the defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey, Mr. Graham functioned in the courtroom the way color commentators did at sporting events, covering the 1991 acquittal of William Kennedy Smith in a Florida rape case and the 1992 acquittals of four Los Angeles police officers videotaped in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Ensuing riots left more than 50 people dead and 2,000 injured.
"Although fans of courtroom dramas may miss the big revelations, the surprise witnesses, the tricky tactics, the climactic confessions that make such shows what they are, the real stuff has a fascination of its own, especially when principles are at stake," Walter Goodman said in a review in The Times. "Along with the legal issues, the program offers character sketches, moments of emotion and even entertaining interludes."
Mr. Graham's best-known Court TV coverage unfolded in Los Angeles in 1995 as O.J. Simpson, the former football and Hollywood star, was acquitted in the 1994 killings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman. Besides legal analysis, Mr. Graham offered running interpretations of lawyers' body language, witnesses' facial expressions and other little dramas.
"Bailey's gripping the podium very, very tightly," Mr. Graham reported during crucial testimony by Detective Mark Fuhrman, a star prosecution witness, while at the prosecutor's table, "Marcia Clark and Chris Darden look very relaxed and happy with this witness."
Mr. Graham, who became Court TV's managing editor and retired in 2008, insisted that cameras in courtrooms did no harm. "I have covered hundreds of televised trials," he wrote in The Times in 1995, "and there was no hint that the camera adversely affected any of them."
Fred Patterson Graham was born in Little Rock, Ark., on Oct. 6, 1931, one of four children of Otis and Lois Patterson Graham. He attended schools in Texarkana, Ark., and graduated from West End High School in Nashville, where his father was a Presbyterian minister.
He received a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1953. In his three years in the Marine Corps, he served in Korea and Japan as an infantry and intelligence officer. He received a law degree from Vanderbilt University in 1959, and another from Oxford University in England in 1960. He then practiced law in Nashville for three years.
In 1961, he married Sheila Lucile McCrea. They had three children, Grier, David and Alyse Graham, and were divorced in 1982. He married Skila Harris in 1982. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his three children and eight grandchildren.
Besides his memoir, he wrote "The Self-Inflicted Wound," on Supreme Court criminal decisions under Chief Justice Earl Warren; "Press Freedom Under Pressure," on the news media and the First Amendment; and "The Alias Program," on the federal witness protection program.

Texto completo: They were 235 days that shook the world, rattled China's regime and refuted the most pernicious wishful thinking since the appeasement of dictators collapsed eight decades ago. Nothing more momentous happened in 2019 than Hong Kong's heroic insurrection.
It began with the April 3 introduction by Beijing's Hong Kong satraps of an extradition bill that would have facilitated the sweeping of inconvenient people into the mainland's suppression machinery that is both Kafkaesque and Orwellian. The convulsions culminated in, but did not end with, Nov. 24's cymbal-crash elections in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which had counted on the island city's majority to rebuke the demonstrators, learned the limits of its sterile program of purchasing subservience by promising prosperity.
Elsewhere on China's periphery, Taiwan has a presidential election in less than two weeks. China's President Xi Jinping began 2019 with a Jan. 2 speech identifying Taiwan as the focus of his campaign to make China great again. If " when, probably " on Jan.-11, 2020, Taiwan reelects President Tsai Ing-wen, the Taiwanese will have joined Hong Kongers in disdaining the 'one country, two systems' fudge as a formula for the incremental suffocation of freedom.
Thirty autumns ago, as the Berlin Wall crumbled and the Soviet Union teetered, approximately 1.5 billion people lived under communist regimes. Today, approximately 1.5 billion people still do. The 1989 figure was 29-percent of the world's population compared with 20 percent in 2019, but 89 percent of today's 20 percent are caught in the tightening vise of China's Leninism, whose inviolable tenet is that nothing shall challenge the party's supremacy.
With this year's revelations about the million, or perhaps millions, swept into the gulag archipelago in northwestern China, it is possible to hope that in 2020 we will hear less from U.S.-businessmen who are as obtuse as they are cocksure. Just 51 days before the New York Times published more than 400 pages of documents on China's concentration camps, presidential aspirant Mike Bloomberg said the CCP's leaders 'listen to the public' and 'Xi Jinping is not a dictator.'
Not content to just 'listen to' the public, the CCP, using ever more sophisticated technology, surveils almost everything done by almost everyone. Perhaps 2019 foreshadowed the day when today's Bloombergs will be remembered as Charles Lindbergh and others are remembered because they thought dictators in the 1930s were 'the wave of the future.'
Would that the United States' serial grovelers had the gumption of the creators of 'South Park.' When China, a supposedly great power that was actually discombobulated by this animated TV series, banned it, the creators said: 'We welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. . . . Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. . . . Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?'
'We have to stand with Hong Kong, but I'm also standing with President Xi,' said the United States' president, who also said of Xi: 'He's a friend of mine.' Xi should reciprocate friendly feelings because President Trump's biggest blunder, made three days after his inauguration, was jettisoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, thereby unraveling a 12-nation fabric of commercial cooperation that excluded China.
Two other Trump chums are Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The former continued his incremental dismemberment of Europe's geographically largest nation, Ukraine, and the latter took Trump's warning against attacking the Kurds as seriously as Trump meant it.
North Korea's Kim Jong Un does not have to settle for mere friendship " in 2018, Trump said, 'We fell in love' " but in 2019, the romance seemed unreciprocated. Kim ended a 522-day self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but Trump minimized their importance because the missiles could not reach the continental United States " just South Korea, Japan and the 80,000 U.S. forces in both places. However, North Korea has given Trump until right now " the end of this calendar year " to make additional U.S. concessions, beyond the scaling back of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises, to avoid 'shocking punishment.' Fresh concessions are North Korea's price for resumption of negotiations that will lead, if the future is like the past 25 years, to other concessions.
However, because nuclear weapons are at issue, you must remember this: In 1945, having witnessed the New Mexico birth of something used on Japan three weeks later, the Manhattan Project's leaders would have been have been pleasantly surprised had they known that 2019 would be the 73rd year without the use of what they had created. Sometimes what does not happen is itself momentous.

Remains of 6 people found after Hawaii tour copter crash
The remains of six people have been found after a helicopter on a tour of one of the most rugged and remote coastlines in Hawaii crashed at the top of a mountain on the island of Kauai, authorities said.
Officials said Friday that there are no indications of survivors and that a search for the last person yet to be recovered would resume in the morning, depending on weather.
A search began for the helicopter carrying a pilot and six passengers from two families after it was reported overdue Thursday evening from a tour of Kauai’s Na Pali Coast. Two passengers are believed to be minors, the Coast Guard said.
Steep terrain, low visibility, choppy seas and rain had complicated the search, the agency said.
The helicopter company, identified as Safari Helicopters, contacted the Coast Guard about 6 p.m. Thursday to say the aircraft was about 30 minutes overdue, authorities said.
SAN DIEGO
Navy SEALs call Gallagher “evil” in leaked videos
Navy SEALs described their platoon leader, retired Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, as “evil,” “toxic” and “perfectly OK with killing anybody that was moving,” in video footage of interviews obtained by The New York Times.
Gallagher’s war crimes case earlier this year gained national attention after President Donald Trump intervened on his behalf despite strong objections from Pentagon leaders who said the president’s move could damage the integrity of the military judicial system.
The footage published Friday was part of a trove of confidential Navy investigative materials the Times obtained about the prosecution of Gallagher, who was accused of battlefield misconduct in Iraq. It shows members of Gallagher’s SEAL Team 7 Alpha Platoon speaking to agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service about his conduct in sometimes emotional interviews.
The material also includes thousands of text messages the SEALs sent to one another about Gallagher’s case and video from a SEAL’s helmet camera that shows Gallagher approach a barely conscious captive – a teenage Islamic State fighter – in May 2017.
Gallagher was charged with murder in the death of the wounded captive in Iraq, posing with the body in photos and shooting civilians. A jury of combat veterans acquitted him of all charges except one count for posing with a human casualty.
ALMATY, Kazakhstan
12 killed, many hurt after jet crashes in Kazakhstan
A jetliner with 98 people aboard struggled to get airborne and crashed shortly after takeoff Friday in Kazakhstan, killing at least 12 people, authorities said.
The Bek Air jet, identified as a 23-year-old Fokker 100, hit a concrete wall and a two-story building soon after departing from Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city and former capital, airport officials said.
The aircraft’s tail also struck the runway twice during takeoff, indicating that it struggled to get off the ground, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Sklyar said.
Fifty-four people people were reported hospitalized with injuries, at least 10 of them in critical condition, officials said.
The cause of the predawn crash was unclear.
PARIS
Notre Dame rector: Fragile cathedral might not be saved
The rector of Notre Dame Cathedral says the Paris landmark is still so fragile that there’s a “50% chance” the structure might not be saved, because scaffolding installed before this year’s fire is threatening the vaults of the Gothic monument.
Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said restoration work isn’t likely to begin until 2021 – and described his “heartache” that Notre Dame couldn’t hold Christmas services this year, for the first time since the French Revolution.
“Today we can say that there is maybe a 50% chance that it will be saved,” he told The Associated Press on the sidelines of Christmas Eve midnight Mass in a nearby church. “There is also 50% chance of scaffolding falling onto the three vaults, so as you can see the building is still very fragile,” he said.
The 12th-century cathedral was under renovation at the time of the accidental April fire, which destroyed its roof and collapsed its spire.

Nonprofit boards and your personal liability

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

A Monteverdi Masterpiece Flies Free

Texto completo: Tradition dictates that the musical calendar year ends, for most concertgoers, with Handel's "Messiah." But 10 years ago, a plucky early-music ensemble rang in the New Year with an even older choral masterpiece, full of pomp, glitter and moments of deep contemplation.
When Jolle Greenleaf, a soprano and the artistic director of Tenet, organized a performance of Monteverdi's "Vespro della Beata Vergine" ("Vespers of the Blessed Virgin") on Jan. 3, 2010, in New York, she meant for it to be a one-off event. After all, that year marked the 400th anniversary of the work, informally referred to as the 1610 Vespers.
But Ms. Greenleaf's production, with the musicians volunteering their work, attracted a crowd of 800 and the attention of critics. (James R. Oestreich, writing in The New York Times, called it "quite simply terrific.")
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
So the endeavor grew into an annual tradition, called the Green Mountain Project, in a riff on Monteverdi's name. The performances were characterized by lithe phrasing and warm, clear sound. Textures were carefully balanced, with robust basses topped by airy trebles, including Ms. Greenleaf's voice, piercing and true.
Along the way, Ms. Greenleaf established Tenet as an independent force on the city's early-music scene, among the most important outside of major institutions like Trinity Wall Street and the Juilliard School. And the group will have ample activities after this season's performances of the 1610 Vespers, next Thursday and Friday at St. Jean Baptiste Church on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. These will be the final salvo of the Green Mountain Project, and Tenet's first rendition of the Vespers without a conductor. A tour to Venice will follow, where the musicians will sing at Monteverdi's grave and perform in churches across the city.
Ms. Greenleaf spoke recently about Monteverdi, the special appeal of the 1610 Vespers and the emancipation of choral singers. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Over the past 10 years, the Green Mountain Project has turned Monteverdi's Vespers into an anchor of New York's musical calendar. How did it begin?
I started it out of a real sense of despair that I wasn't going to perform this piece that I was madly in love with. I had gone through a major illness and had recently given birth to my daughter and wasn't really being hired anywhere. So when we decided to do it, it felt like a gift. It was a big year with the 400th anniversary of the piece, and we wanted to put our stamp on it.
How did you put your stamp on it? What are the qualities you look for in the singers and instrumentalists you work with?
When I listen to some of the older recordings, I think it was hard for people to understand how this music functioned best. Having large choirs sing this music -- it's hard to digest. Monteverdi really meant it to be sung one singer to a part, so you get this vivid clarity.
For the singers, it's essential that they can offer a variety of sounds. A lot has to do with understanding strong and weak syllables and making sure that comes through in the singing. Monteverdi cared deeply about the text; for all the syllables to sound the same would create the wrong color palette.
With instrumentalists you want the same: They are essentially singing. If they match our strong and weak inflections on the syllables, they basically boost our sound, and our diction carries over.
What have you learned about Monteverdi over these years immersed in his music?
It's hard for us to know exactly what he was like. He could be a curmudgeon. He was obviously a masterful composer, no question. He had a very fun and light side that you can see in his work, as well as a deeply religious side. This piece uses everything he has on offer. You get so many aspects of his personality and his compositional style, all in one work.
Were you surprised by the popular success of this music? In New York in early January, right after the glut of "Messiah"?
I've heard stories of people getting married after hearing this piece with their partner and deciding, "Oh, they understand the Monteverdi Vespers, I'm going to marry this person." I find a lot of scientists and mathematicians are drawn to this music in a big way. If our world had the opportunity to hear it more, I think it could be as popular as "Messiah." And I do see it being done more often now than in the decade before the anniversary of 2010. Clearly everybody got the bug.
What does it mean to you to bring this music to Venice?
I felt like ending this project needed to be done in a way that really honored everything that everybody did over the years. It feels like the crowning glory -- we are going to do it where Monteverdi flourished and was buried. But it's a little crazy. There's so many pieces to the organization. There are no cars; there are so many rules. Getting a chamber organ meant renting it from pretty far away and then putting it on a boat.
In New York, you will perform the Vespers without a conductor for the first time. How much of that is about empowering the singers?
As a woman, trying to run an ensemble has its tricky moments. I spent years feeling that my ideas were not worthy enough to stand on their own, and I brought in a lot of guest directors. And yet each time I knew exactly what I wanted the music to sound like and I knew what I wanted to say with it. But I didn't know if I could say those things and have them be reacted to in the way that a male counterpart could. Part of that is about being a singer, and about the place that we hold in the music community -- which is not what it was in the Baroque. And part of that is being a woman with a high speaking voice, a high singing voice. I often felt that no one was taking me seriously.
But I'm trying to be braver, to have the courage of my convictions. I know that this music does not need, nor did it originally have, a conductor. I feel that as long as singers are constantly under the thumb of a conductor, they will not use their full musical abilities. And that is a very tough road to be on in a community where conductors really want a job and where donors really want to give those conductors a job.

Texto completo: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both campaigned for, and won, the White House on the watchword “hope.” What watchword will it take for a Democrat to win this time?
My suggestion: soap.
Nearly three years into Donald Trump’s presidency, America needs a hard scrub and a deep cleanse. It needs to wash out the grime and grease of an administration that every day does something to make the country feel soiled.
Soiled by a president who, Castro-like, delivered a two-hour rant at a rally in Michigan the night he was impeached. Who described his shakedown of Ukraine as “perfect.” Who extolled the world’s cruelest tyrant as someone who “wrote me beautiful letters. … We fell in love.” Who abandoned vulnerable allies in Syria, then opted to maintain troops in the country “only for oil.” Who, barely a year before the El Paso massacre, demonized illegal immigrants who “pour into and infest our Country.”
The list goes on, and most everyone feels it. In June, the Pew Research Center published a survey on how the country sees the state of public discourse. The most striking finding: “A 59 percent majority of Republicans and Republican leaners say they often or sometimes feel concerned by what Trump says. About half also say they are at least sometimes embarrassed (53 percent) and confused (47 percent) by Trump’s statements.”
What’s true of Republicans is far more so of the rest of the United States. Pew found that overwhelming majorities of Americans were “concerned” (76%), “confused” (70%), “embarrassed” (69%), “angry” (65%), “insulted” (62%) and “frightened” (56%) by the things Trump says.
These numbers should devastate Trump’s chances of reelection. They don’t, for three reasons.
First, 76% of Americans rate economic conditions positively, up from 48% at the time of Trump’s election. Second, the progressive left’s values seem increasingly hostile to mainstream ones, as suggested by the titanic row over J.K. Rowling’s recent tweet defending a woman who was fired over her outspoken views on transgenderism. Third, the more the left rages about Trump and predicts nothing but catastrophe and conspiracy from him, the more out of touch it seems when the catastrophes don’t happen and the conspiracy theories come up short.
No wonder Trump’s average approval ratings have steadily ticked up since the end of October. In the view of middle-of-the-road America, the president may be bad, but he’s nowhere near as bad as his critics say.
In that same view, while Trump’s critics might be partly right about him, they’re a lot less right than they believe. In a contest between the unapologetic jerk in the White House and the self-styled saints seeking to unseat him, the jerk might just win.
How to avoid that outcome?
The most obvious point is not to promise a wrenching overhaul of the economy when it shows no signs of needing such an overhaul. There are plenty of serious long-term risks to our prosperity, including a declining birthrate, national debt north of $23 trillion, the erosion of the global free-trade consensus, threats to the political independence of the Federal Reserve and the popularization of preposterous economic notions such as Modern Monetary Theory.
But anyone who thinks blowout government spending, partly financed by an unconstitutional and ineffective wealth tax, is going to be an electoral winner should look at the fate of Britain’s hapless Jeremy Corbyn.
What would work? Smart infrastructure spending. New taxes on carbon offset by tax cuts on income and saving. Modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget.
What these proposals lack in progressive ambition, they make up in political plausibility and the inherent appeal of modesty. They also defeat Trump’s most potent reelection argument, which is that, no matter who opposes him, he’s running against the crazy left.
Hence the second point. Too much of today’s left is too busy pointing out the ugliness of the Trumpian right to notice its own ugliness: its censoriousness, nastiness and complacent self-righteousness. But millions of ordinary Americans see it, and they won’t vote for a candidate who emboldens and empowers woke culture. The Democrat who breaks with that culture, as Clinton did in 1992 over Sister Souljah and Obama did in October over “cancel culture,” is the one likeliest to beat Trump.
Finally, the winning Democrat will need to make Trump’s presidency seem insignificant rather than monumental — an unsightly pimple on our long republican experiment, not a fatal cancer within it. Mike Bloomberg has the financial wherewithal to make Trump’s wealth seem nearly trivial. Joe Biden has the life experience to make Trump’s attacks seem petty. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have the rhetorical skills to turn Trump’s taunts against him.
As with most bullies, the key to beating Trump is to treat him as the nonentity he fundamentally is. Wouldn’t it be something if his political opponents and obsessed media critics resolved, for 2020, to talk about him a little less and past him a lot more?
When your goal is to wash your hands of something bad, you don’t need a sword. Soap will do.

Texto completo: Joe Biden ha asegurado este viernes que no declarará en el ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra el presidente Donald Trump, si es llamado para ello.
“No lo haré porque está todo diseñado como Trump lo ha hecho durante toda su vida: intentando desviar la atención sobre él mismo. El asunto que se trata no es lo que hice yo”, ha asegurado Biden, en unas declaraciones recogidas por el diario The New York Times.
El exvicepresidente ha asegurado que es todo una “distracción”, a lo que ha añadido que los motivos por lo que sería llamado a declarar en el ‘impeachment’ contra Trump serían “absolutamente engañosos”
Por ello, ha reiterado que los republicanos quieren su testimonio para “desviar la atención” sobre las acciones que ha realizado Trump al frente de la Casa Blanca.
Las declaraciones de Biden tienen lugar después de que la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos aprobara abrir un ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra Trump, quien se convertirá así en el tercer mandatario del país en hacer frente a un juicio político.
Con 230 votos demócratas a favor, 197 en contra (195 republicanos y dos demócratas) y una única abstención, la de la congresista demócrata Tulsi Gabbard, los cargos presentados en contra de Trump por abuso de poder y obstrucción a la justicia salieron adelante.
La Comisión Judicial acusó a Trump de un cargo de abuso de poder por presionar a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, para que abriera dos investigaciones que le beneficiarían para la reelección en 2020: una sobre las supuestas corruptelas del precandidato demócrata Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter en sus negocios en Ucrania y otra sobre “la desacreditada teoría” de que fue ese país, no Rusia, el que interfirió en los comicios de 2016.
Trump también está acusado de un segundo cargo de obstrucción al Congreso por rechazar los requerimientos que le ha hecho la Cámara de Representantes tanto de información como de comparecencia en el marco de la investigación del ‘impeachment’.
Por su parte, la Casa Blanca afirmó que esta decisión fue “uno de los episodios más lamentables de la historia estadounidense”. “Sin recibir un solo voto republicano y sin probar que se incurriese en ningún tipo de delito, los demócratas han sacado adelante unos cargos ilegítimos contra el presidente en la Cámara de Representantes”, señalaron.

Texto completo: The House of Representatives impeached President Bill Clinton on Dec. 19, 1998. The votes, in which two articles of impeachment passed, were held around midday. By 3 p.m., the House had named its impeachment managers and physically delivered the articles to the Senate for trial.
Impeachment was on. The House, controlled by a Republican majority, was serious about its ultimately failed effort to remove Clinton from office.
Contrast that to today. On Wednesday, Dec. 18, at around 8 p.m., the Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately announced the House would not appoint managers, and the articles would not be delivered to the Senate. The next day, Pelosi told reporters she did not want to talk anymore about it, and the House went into recess until Jan. 7.
Impeachment was not on, or at least a Senate trial was not on. Pelosi was holding out, apparently, for better terms in a Senate trial.
Pelosi acted after a Harvard professor and zealous impeachment advocate, Laurence Tribe, published an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing the Democratic strategy should be "voting for articles of impeachment but holding off for the time being on transmitting them to the Senate."
Withholding the articles, Tribe said, would strengthen Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer’s hand as he negotiates with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the terms of the trial. It would do so, Tribe speculated, "because of McConnell’s and Trump’s urgent desire to get this whole business behind them."
Without concessions from McConnell, Tribe urged Democrats to withhold the articles indefinitely, because a trial dominated by majority Republicans "would fail to render a meaningful verdict of acquittal."
It seemed a far-fetched idea, to be generous. McConnell and Senate Republicans would be perfectly happy if they never had to hold a trial.
I asked one GOP lawmaker, via text, what the party’s reaction was. He texted back a one-word answer: "Laughter."
Nevertheless, Tribe’s idea took off in some circles of the Democratic left. His column was published on Monday morning, and by Wednesday night Pelosi had adopted his plan.
Just to be clear: Pelosi has no leverage over a Senate proceeding. The Constitution gives the House the "sole power" to impeach, a power Pelosi and her majority used to its fullest. But the Constitution gives the Senate the "sole power" to try all impeachments. The speaker of the House has no role.
Given that, Republicans have been wondering what Pelosi is up to. Crazy theories — at least they seem to be crazy theories — have emerged.
Democrats would impeach the president repeatedly. (That was actually a serious suggestion from a New York Times columnist in October.) Or Democrats would never send the articles to the Senate, to keep impeachment hanging over Trump’s head. Or whatever.
The key Democrats aren’t saying. But one plausible notion came from The Hill columnist A.B. Stoddard. There is, Stoddard said, "a lot of pressure on Democrats to wait this out until there is more to throw at the president."
It’s not clear precisely how that would work, because the House has already passed two articles of impeachment that make specific accusations.
Beyond that, withholding impeachment indefinitely in hopes that a federal investigation will come up with something big — basically what Democrats did in the Trump-Russia affair — might end in disappointment.
In any event, Pelosi is withholding the articles of impeachment. It is unclear how long she will do it, but it seems they will be withheld at least until Jan. 7, when the House returns for business. That alone will delay a Senate trial significantly.
In the limbo Pelosi has created, almost anything seems possible.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.
Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.
Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.
Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."
Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.
Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

Texto completo: An email app developer says it has uncovered new data that suggests Apple has long been suppressing the rankings of apps in the App Store that compete with Apple's own offerings, according to new court filings by the developer, which sued Apple in October for patent infringement and antitrust violations.
Blix, which developed the BlueMail app, made the discovery only when Apple's rankings suddenly changed in its favor. At the end of September, Blix unexpectedly jumped from 143rd in Apple's ranking for mail apps to 13th. Blix had for years been highly ranked in the competing Android app stores, run by companies like Google, Samsung, Amazon and Huawei. But on Apple's iOS, where it competes with Apple's own mail app, it had long been ranked low.
Blix started looking at other apps that also compete with Apple's preinstalled apps. Several others, such as a mail app from Russian tech company Yandex, had also seen dramatic spikes in their rankings. Blix says it used market research firm Sensor Tower to research the unexplained spike in BlueMail's ranking on the iOS store, which happened Sept. 26. Using Sensor Tower's historical data, it was able to determine that BlueMail wasn't the only app that had experienced the spike.
"Multiple different types of Apple app competitors enjoyed a sudden, unexplained rise in search rankings," according to Blix's latest filing in court, which appeared last week. The spike came roughly two weeks after a New York Times article examined how Apple ranked its apps higher than competitors'.
Apple spokesman Fred Sainz declined to comment on the litigation. On its website, Apple says its App Store provides "equal opportunities to developers to deliver their apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch."
The allegations come as Apple faces increased scrutiny for how it treats smaller competitors. The House Judiciary Committee and the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating whether Apple has violated antitrust laws. Last month, the top Democrat in charge of the House investigation raised concerns that Apple was using privacy as a way to shield itself from antitrust scrutiny. The committee has requested information from Apple on how it uses the innovations of app developers on its platform in its own services, one of the key allegations in Blix's lawsuit.
The suit brought by Blix is unusual. Most app developers are careful about saying anything that might be construed as critical of Apple. That's because the only way to distribute software to Apple users is with express approval from the company. Apple also decides which apps are included in the lists of apps that it recommends, one of the most important methods of marketing to Apple customers. Taking the company to court is an almost-unheard-of method of resolving a dispute with Apple.
"It was not an easy decision to proceed with this lawsuit against the largest tech company in the world," said Ben Volach, who co-founded Blix. "Blix, and its BlueMail product, are the latest in Apple's long line of victims. Apple's monopoly over app distribution forecloses competition and harms consumers. Apple has also harmed additional developers who would otherwise compete fairly," he said.

Trump endorses Collins re-election bid

Texto completo: When Donald Trump ran for president in 2016, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine refused to vote for him.
Denouncing him for mocking the vulnerable and attacking "ethnic and religious minorities," she wrote in House Speaker Paul Ryan instead, a choice that did not even register in the final results since the Wisconsin Republicans had not registered as any sort of candidate in Maine.
But it appears that President Trump, unusually for him, is not holding a grudge.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham issued a tweet recently hailing Collins, a four-term Republican, for showing "unbelievable courage" during the bitter confirmation fight last year surrounding U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "and at other times when our country has needed a steady voice."
"We need her to ensure a GOP majority in 2020," Graham wrote, and urged his supporters to send money to Collins' campaign.
Graham also linked to her recent re-election announcement.
On Monday evening, Trump retweeted Graham's words and added a few of his own.
"I agree 100%!" Trump wrote.
It marks one of the few times Trump has directly praised Collins, who has proven a presidential ally on some key issues and a thorn in his side on others, especially in her 2017 vote to block repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
The day after her speech in favor of Kavanaugh in September 2018, Trump told reporters, "I thought that Susan was incredible yesterday."
Collins has avoided saying anything about whether she will endorse Trump in 2020, focusing instead on what she perceives as the need to work with him on matters of national importance.
While she has not taken a stand on the presidential race next year - which is bound to have a major impact on her effort to win a fifth term - she also has not retracted any of the harsh comments she issued about Trump in a 2016 column in The Washington Post.
Collins has expressed distaste for Trump's tweets on a number of occasions, occasionally denouncing some as over the line and sometimes simply wishing he would stop using the social media platform.
It is not clear whether Trump has ever referred to Collins so directly before on Twitter.
In 2018, he blasted a bipartisan immigration bill she co-sponsored, claiming it would be "a total catastrophe" for the nation.
Generally, though, he has avoided mentioning her.
Trump has retweeted or touted U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, dozens of times. The president has also assailed Gail Collins, a New York Times columnist, more often than he has ever referred to Maine's senior senator.
One of the Democrats hoping to unseat Collins in Maine's election next year, Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, wrote Tuesday on Twitter that Trump and Graham want Collins to return to the Senate in 2021 "because they know she'll take the side of Republican special interests, not the people of Maine."

Trump is a danger for Jews like me

Texto completo: When I was a Jewish kid growing up in suburban Los Angeles, we thought being Jewish meant supporting Israel.
There really wasn't a choice. If you identified as Jewish, as I and most of my friends did, the religious education we got, the youth groups we joined, and the summer camps where we played were all grounded in one thing. It wasn't God -- it was Zionism, the political project of settling Jewish people in Israel.
We never asked -- and no one ever taught us in Sunday school -- who had already been living on that land, long known as Palestine, when European Jews arrived around the end of the 19th century and started building settlements there.

My own break with Zionism came in my mid-20s, after reading the letters of Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl, imploring Cecil Rhodes, the leader of British land theft in Africa, to support his work in Palestine. Their projects were both "something colonial," Herzl assured Rhodes.
Today, younger Jews are asking hard questions at earlier ages, and more of them have been actively critical of Israel in its assaults on Palestinians and Palestinian rights.
When the Trump White House says that criticizing or boycotting the state of Israel is anti-Semitic and issues an executive order that aims to shut down criticism of Israel on college campuses, many Jewish students aren't buying it. One 20-year-old Jewish student and Hillel member at the University of North Carolina told the New York Times that she worried the executive order "falsely equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism" and is targeted at eliminating criticism of Israel.
Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and advisor, claims that the executive order is intended to make sure that Jews are protected by the Civil Rights Act's "prohibition against discrimination based on race, color, or national origin."
He says that the executive order does not define Jews as a nationality, but he goes on to proclaim that "anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism." This formulation essentially labels Jews -- along with Palestinians and all others -- who don't support Zionism as anti-Semitic.
Jews come in all races, colors and ethnicities. The Trump/Kushner view is an insidious way of claiming that Jews are all somehow linked to or accountable to Israel. That charge of "dual
loyalty" is one of the oldest anti-Semitic canards around.
Of course, even as the Trump administration tries to silence criticism of Israel, real anti-Semitism is rising, especially during the Trump administration. We know what it looks like.
Anti-Semitism looks like the attack on a synagogue outside San Diego. It looks like Pittsburgh, where the alleged Tree of Life synagogue killer accused Jews of "bring[ing] invaders in that kill our people" by supporting resettlement of refugees. It looks like Klansmen and Nazis shouting "Jews will not replace us" in Charlottesville.
That virulent anti-Semitism doesn't come from supporters of Palestinian rights. It comes from the violent white supremacists operating increasingly publicly and proudly across the United States. Those same anti-Semites are still reveling in the support of the president, who called them "very fine people" after Charlottesville.
Real anti-Semitism is also coming directly from the White House itself -- from a president who tells Jewish Republicans that he doesn't expect their support because he doesn't need their money, who invites to a White House Hanukkah party a Christian pastor who says Jews who don't convert to Christianity "are going to hell," and who asserts that Jews will "have to vote for me, you have no choice" because Democrats are proposing tax hikes on millionaires and billionaires.
Trying to suppress criticism of Israel even as Israel's government becomes ever more repressive of Palestinian rights won't work, especially when the White House itself is surrounded by anti-Semitism. Jewish and other progressive student groups are already asserting their intention to fight against the denial of free speech.
Likewise, insisting that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism doesn't make it true. A new generation of young Jews -- and a whole bunch of us who aren't so young anymore -- know that's wrong.

We're Aging Fast, and Not Doing Anything About It

Texto completo: Like climate change, the aging of America demands a serious rethinking of the way we live.
One of the paradoxes of this presidential campaign is that while many of the candidates are in their eighth decade of life, fundamental issues associated with the aging of American society are still receiving relatively little attention from the public, the press and politicians themselves. In 2031, the oldest baby boomers will turn 85, entering the land of the "old old" and facing exponentially higher risk for dementia, serious physical disabilities and long-term dependency.
Like climate change, the aging of America demands serious reconsideration of the way we live. Confronting the issue and its many implications, from Medicare's failure to cover long-term care to the ethics of physician-assisted dying, requires what seems to be the most difficult task for human beings -- thinking about the future.
In November, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the birthrate among women of childbearing age had dropped to a record low, continuing a sharp decline in births that began around the financial crisis of 2008. At the same time, The Journal of the American Medical Association reported an increased death rate in the 25- to 64-year-old age group, with the main causes thought to be opioid overdoses, alcoholism and suicide.
What these statistics mean is that if these trends continue (always an important caveat in demographic studies), there will be many fewer young and middle-aged people to care for the frailest of the old, whose death rate has not increased in recent years. The population of the prime caregiving age group, from 45 to 64, is expected to increase by only 1 percent before 2030, while the population over 80 will increase by 79 percent.
In certain respects, the crisis is already upon us. A study published this year by Gallup and West Health, a research organization dedicated to lowering health care costs, showed that people over 65 had withdrawn an estimated $ 22 billion from long-term savings accounts in the previous year to pay for health expenses Medicare didn't cover. A recently published article in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society underscores the sobering likelihood that one out of seven 65-year-olds today can expect to be disabled for at least five years before death. The largest increase in the disabled population is projected to occur in the 2030s.
Although there has been considerable talk about health care during the Democratic presidential debates, nearly all of the focus has been on the young with inadequate insurance coverage. That Medicare as we now know it fails to work for many retirees, leaving them in danger of going bankrupt, gets short shrift.
The other side of the coin is that many people in their 60s and 70s are self-sufficient and hate nothing more than the thought of retirement. Why else would five septuagenarians -- Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren -- be seeking the presidency? "Because we are aging as a society, it's time to cast aside outdated assumptions that people over a certain age are monolithic," says Jean Accius, senior vice president of thought leadership at AARP. "We need to recognize the opportunities of all stages of life, not just the challenges."
Our conflicting attitudes toward aging play a critical role in the silence about age-related issues. On the one hand, many Americans cherish the idea that "70 is the new 50" -- a rosy falsehood contradicted by any serious study of the age curve for major diseases. On the other, we remain scared to death of the very word "old" (which politicians themselves, and the journalists who question them, almost never use). "Older" (as in "older Americans") tend to be the preferred euphemism. This is particularly silly, given that everyone is older than someone.
The day-to-day specifics of what it means to have so many ill old people living longer are so numerous that it is hard to think about them simultaneously. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia for those over 85, offers a textbook example of this complexity.
For people older than 85, the risk of developing Alzheimer's is 14 times higher than for those ages 65 to 69. Contrary to the narrative that America is a selfish society in which most people neglect their older relatives or neighbors, the Alzheimer's Association reports that 83 percent of help received by old adults in the United States is provided by family members, friends or other unpaid caregivers. Approximately two-thirds of the caregivers are women and one-third of those aiding people with dementia are daughters.
The financial impact on both the old and those in late middle age is staggering. The median savings of people in their middle age is just $ 15,000, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. Social Security plus $ 15,000 presents a scary prospect for those who hope for a decent standard of living throughout the average 20-year American retirement.
When dementia strikes, all bets are off because even if there is a child who desperately wants to keep his or her sick parents at home, it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to do so without home health care aides -- which, again, Medicare usually generally does not pay for. The problem is not just the shortcomings of Medicare, or the inadequate savings of many Americans, or the absence of effective treatment for Alzheimer's. It is all of those things.
First, it is vital to address the disturbing human realities behind the statistics. An aging society affects everyone, but it affects women most because of their greater longevity. How can we continue to count on women to provide two-thirds of unpaid caregiving? I gnash my teeth every time I encounter one of those ubiquitous television ads for a business called "A Place for Mom," which provides much-needed service by helping people find long-term care for parents. It's not called "A Place for Dad" for a very good reason. We assume that Mom (or Daughter) is caring for Dad at home.
Second, public programs and private companies need to cooperate to provide opportunities for old people who want to and are perfectly able to go on working. That's an important objective of AARP, which held town halls on aging in Iowa last summer. Most candidates attended at least one of the meetings, but the discussions received little national publicity.
Third, a healthier attitude toward aging also means examining moral issues. Physician-assisted suicide, for example, is the source of a fierce ethical debate that matters greatly to anyone who can imagine growing old. Questions about the end of life, like those about abortion, should be posed in every national forum. According to a Gallup poll conducted last year, 72 percent of Americans agree that doctors should be allowed to help end a patient's life painlessly if there is no hope of a cure and the medical assistance is requested by patients and their families. The support drops to 65 percent if the phrase "doctor-assisted suicide" is used instead of "end a patient's life" -- yet another case of the American preference for euphemism.
No single "program" can deal with the intimate, painful problems associated with the growing proportion of old people who experience long but not necessarily healthy lives. Facing our own fears about what it means to grow old, without resort to soothing euphemisms, is the essential psychological shift that all Americans must make before we can meet the deadline to create a better reality for the old and their families.

Texto completo: Pepe, Gaysper and other symbols teach us that tech companies need policies that adapt to a changing world.
The idea that platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram should remove hate speech is relatively uncontroversial. But doing this isn't easy. Hate speech is fluid, dependent on cultural context and social meaning. To manage it, platforms must constantly re-evaluate hateful symbols and communicate with users about their decision-making.
Few examples illustrate this need better than the long, strange journey of Pepe the Frog, the crudely drawn comic-book amphibian that originated as a mascot for slackers; was repeatedly altered by white supremacists for racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic memes; was classified by the Anti-Defamation League as a hate symbol in 2016; and was repurposed this summer and fall by protesters in Hong Kong to promote a pro-democracy message that had nothing to do with white supremacy or terrorism.
Though exactly the same in appearance, the Hong Kong version of Pepe is a different frog. It provides a real-time demonstration of how hate speech can be defanged, based on shifting circumstances, expanded frames of reference and varied common usage.
At times, the targets of hateful terms have reworked or reversed them. Take a former epithet like "queer." It originally had neutral connotations of general nonmainstream behavior before the early 1900s. "Queer" became associated primarily with homosexual men between the 1910s and 1920s, and became a slur. Beginning in the 1990s, AIDS activists re-appropriated the term as a signifier of self-identity, to highlight the ugliness of homophobia in order to confront it. "Queer" has generally regained a neutral or even positive connotation. For many, it stands for inclusivity. Similarly, the pink triangle, which was originally a badge used by Nazis to identify gay people, was transformed into a sign of pride.
Shifts like these have always happened. But today, thanks to meme culture, online audiences can flip hate speech on its head faster than ever. In April, the Spanish political party Vox tweeted a meme referencing "The Lord of the Rings": a picture of Aragorn, digitally manipulated to include the party logo and a Spanish flag. Aragorn was facing down orcs, who sported symbols for feminism, communism, media outlets -- and oddly, an Android ghost emoji striped with rainbow colors. Cunning users termed him Gaysper, and as the image went viral, he transformed from intended insult to a stance against hatred via mockery and humor.
Pepe, Gaysper and other once-hateful symbols teach us that tech companies should institutionalize impermanence -- they should build their policies to continually adapt to the changing world. Those who call on the companies to take steps to stem the tide of xenophobia, racism and the targeting of minorities that we're seeing around the world should keep this in mind as well.
Local activists in Hong Kong transformed Pepe into an emoji on encrypted platforms, dressed as a protester or a journalist. "Symbols and colors that mean something in one culture can mean something completely different in another culture," a protester told The Times, "so I think if Americans are really offended by this, we should explain to them what it means to us." Most seem to understand the frog to be a symbol of youth and were unaware of his link to the alt-right. If Google, Twitter and Facebook had built in photo recognition to take down all images of Pepe the Frog, the movement might have been robbed of a critical rallying cry.
So what can platforms do? First, they can fill the public information vacuum around hate speech policy. While platforms have been doing better at making broader commitments against hate, like Facebook's recent announcement to take a wider view of hate speech and extremist-related content, what's missing is the ground-floor view. Tech company terms of service don't explain how, in practice, they decide if nonhistorical content is hateful or no longer hateful. They do not state how context shifts affect their operations. The public does not know if companies revisit their enforcement calculus and, more important, the contours of how that might occur.
Second, platforms should consider attaching a periodic expiration date to exclusionary actions. This is not to render them toothless but to provide a mechanism allowing company policy to recalibrate at given points, and adjust to the fluidity of the internet and evolving social mores. This can help the targets of hate speech as well. Companies may be more willing to act if everyone understands that their processes are constantly evolving.
Third, companies should be responsive to shifting memes, especially in volatile contexts. Human rights impact assessments are common best practices in corporate social responsibility, but this is not yet a regular activity for most tech companies, especially in the context of hate speech and its impacts. Platforms need to evaluate when it is more likely that content on social media will result in offline consequences -- especially in risky situations like political unrest and around elections -- and then quickly reallocate more of their staff members, time and attention to monitor trends and challenges in related content and respond quickly.
If common usage can change a comic strip into a hate symbol, then authentic engagement can similarly transform its meaning. If platforms want to protect their users from hateful content while ensuring that vital political expression isn't affected, they should make hate speech policies that are informed by this reality.

Texto completo: BY CATHY BUSSEWITZ
The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Travis Kalanick, who built Uber into a ride-hailing giant only to be ousted as CEO over the company's sexist "bro" culture, is cashing out.
Kalanick disclosed Tuesday that he has sold off all his Uber stock - estimated at more than $2.5 billion - and is resigning from the board of directors, severing ties to the company he co-founded a decade ago.
"Uber has been a part of my life for the past 10 years. At the close of the decade, and with the company now public, it seems like the right moment for me to focus on my current business and philanthropic pursuits," the 43-year-old entrepreneur said in a statement.
Uber, based in San Francisco, transformed the way people get around and the way they make a living, too, turbocharging the gig economy and undermining the taxi industry. Its nearly 4 million drivers around the globe have logged 15 billion trips since 2010, when Kalanick and Garrett Camp came up with the idea of hailing a ride from a smartphone after a trip to Paris when they couldn't find a taxi.
But Kalanick was fired as CEO in the summer of 2017 with the company mired in lawsuits.
Uber under Kalanick grew with incredible speed, but like a number of other tech startups, it ran into trouble with a corporate culture that appeared at times to be spinning out of control. It was a problem Kalanick acknowledged. Before his ouster as chief executive, he said he needed to "fundamentally change and grow up."
His career at Uber seemed to fit a certain pattern seen in Silicon Valley: The brash and disruptive personalities who are great at creating startups can be ill-suited for the corner office when the company reaches maturity. Sometimes "adult supervision" in the form of experienced executives has to be brought in.
In one of the Uber's biggest scandals, Kalanick was accused of presiding over a workplace environment that allowed rampant sexual harassment.
A former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, leveled sexual harassment and sexism allegations in a 2017 blog post, saying a boss - not Kalanick - had propositioned her and higher-ups had ignored her complaints. Kalanick called the accusations "abhorrent" and hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate. Holder recommended reducing Kalanick's responsibilities.
The problems went beyond employee relations.
Waymo, the self-driving car company spun off from Google, sued Uber in 2017, alleging a top manager at Google stole pivotal technology from the company before leaving to run Uber's self-driving car division.
Uber also gained a reputation under Kalanick for running roughshod over regulators, launching in markets before officials were able to draft rules and regulations to keep the ride-hailing business in check.
During Kalanick's tenure, The New York Times revealed that Uber used a phony version of its app to thwart authorities in cities where it was operating illegally. Uber's software identified regulators who were posing as riders and blocked access to them. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating.
"Many investors will be glad to see this dark chapter in the rear view mirror," Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said in a note to investors.
Kalanick is not alone among visionary tech entrepreneurs who have stumbled after building startups from nothing.
Tesla founder Elon Musk has had too loose a grip on his Twitter habit and has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors with a tweet. He was also sued for defamation, but ultimately cleared, for going on Twitter and calling a British cave explorer "pedo guy" - short for "pedophile."
Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, recently stepped aside after the company canceled its initial public offering amid concerns about his judgment, including his use of company stock to secure a $500 million personal loan.
After Kalanick's ouster, former Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was brought on as Uber's chief executive to clean up Uber's image and steer the company to its stock market debut in May. But Uber's stock floundered and fell almost 11% in its first day of trading as a public company. It has tumbled more than 30% since.
Kalanick had been one of Uber's biggest shareholders, owning 9% of the company at the time of the IPO.
"Let's call it like it is: Uber stock has been a nightmare since the IPO coming out of the gates," Ives said.

Resumen: Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ...

Texto completo: Not long ago, I was in a meeting to talk about a public policy issue. It was a little complex, and as we considered the various angles I began to think about what it would take to translate talk into change on the ground. I wasn’t analyzing the politics of it — I was focused on the types of people who’d have to roll up their sleeves.
What I came away with was a list of skills, none of them unusual, but all of them vital to getting things done in the increasingly complicated world that government faces. Here’s some of what it takes: * You need a legislative draftsman, someone who understands the specialized language of bill-writing and how to translate ideas into law; * You’ll almost certainly need several lawyers involved to steer clear of legal shoals, as well as budget experts who can handle cost estimates and projections; * It’s helpful to have someone who understands what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior in the field you’re addressing; * There are a lot of subject matters that play a role in almost any major problem: environmental, financial, security and military, logistics, health, education, international dimensions — and you’ll want to be able to consult with experts in all of them; * Because, almost invariably, you’re dealing with computer systems or actual machinery, it’s helpful to have the appropriate types of engineers on hand; * It’s often helpful to work with a historian or two who can put the problem in context; * You need people who are familiar with the private sector and understand what businesses and corporations can and cannot reasonably achieve, since so many issues today involve both the public and private sectors; * You have to be able to understand and cover the politics of your approach, meaning you need people who can bridge the White House and Congress or the governor’s office and the legislature; * Somewhere along the line you’ll need PR experts who understand radio, print, TV, and social media, since you’ll have to enlist the public, or at least win its support; * And, of course, you’ll need to figure out how to raise the money you’ll need, both through the public purse and from the private and nonprofit worlds.
My point is simple: To make our system and this country work, we need a lot of experts and competent bureaucrats to deal with the problems that come cascading down on government. And here’s what I can tell you, after decades of close contact with federal civil servants: We have them. By and large, this country is served by a professional and dedicated group of public employees, whether you’re talking about the National Weather Service, the Foreign Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Defense Department ... We’re blessed with a lot of talented people.
Which is why I’ve never shared the contempt and outright hostility toward federal bureaucrats that is so often expressed in the public arena these days. They deal with very tough problems and they’re usually good at what they do. They just don’t toot their own horns about it.
This was on full display in the recent House Intelligence Committee hearings on impeachment. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it recently, "[T]he civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them." He went on to quote political scientist Hugh Heclo, "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a ‘professional’ manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some bad apples within the bureaucracy. There always are, but they’re rare. And most of the time, inspectors general, administrative processes, and, when it’s working, congressional oversight address the problems reasonably well. Attacking cabinet officials and civil service employees publicly, the way President Trump seems to enjoy doing, seems counterproductive. These are, after all, the very people he has to depend on to move his programs forward.
In the face of the many challenges we confront, the professionalism, talent, and competence of our civil servants matter. We’ve been fortunate: many of them have withstood attacks on themselves and the systems they depend on for support. So far.

Sondland is pivotal piece to the puzzle

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Gordon Sondland seemed to feast on his newfound political power when he snagged a plum ambassadorship and landed in Brussels as America's top diplomat to the European Union.
USA TODAY explains
What to expect this week as eight key witnesses prepare to tell their stories. 2A
Appointed to the post by President Donald Trump after he donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, Sondland had a direct line to the Oval Office. And he wasn't shy, or even careful, about using it.
He apparently flaunted his ability to dial Trump's phone number at will and told more seasoned administration officials to move aside as he usurped their portfolios – particularly when it came to Ukraine, even though it's not part of the EU.
Now, Sondland's relationship with Trump and his extensive dealings with Ukraine have put the former hotelier, and his boss, in a precarious position. On Wednesday, Sondland takes center stage in the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry when he gives public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. For impeachment investigators, he is a unique witness; he was Trump's point man in the effort to push politically motivated investigations in Ukraine, and he seemed to have the most extensive, direct dealings with the president on the matter.
"Sondland will be the first individual in this inquiry to give open testimony about direct contacts with Mr. Trump on the issue of the investigations, military assistance (to Ukraine) and the relationship with Zelensky," said Aaron David Miller, a top State Department negotiator for past presidents of both parties and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"Whether he chooses to open the door to further teasers I don't know," Miller said.
The wealthy Portland hotelier has already told lawmakers he relayed a quid pro quo to a top Ukraine official, telling him U.S. military aid to Ukraine was likely contingent on a public statement by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, committing to the investigations Trump wanted. These included one into former Vice President Joe Biden and another into a debunked theory about Ukraine's involvement in 2016 election interference.
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, likened Sondland's diplomatic agenda to a "drug deal." Bolton's deputy, Fiona Hill, portrayed him as a dangerously uninformed and unconventional diplomat.
Now, new evidence emerged during last week's first public impeachment hearing that makes Sondland an even more intriguing witness for House Democrats.
The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, revealed Nov. 13 that one of his deputies overheard Sondland chatting with the president on July 26 while they were in a restaurant in Kiev.
In that cellphone call, "the member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone asking Ambassador Sondland about "the investigations," Taylor recounted during the House Intelligence Committee's first public impeachment hearing. "Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward."
After the call, Taylor's aide asked Sondland what Trump thought about Ukraine. "Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden" than he does about Ukraine, Taylor recounted.
House Democrats interviewed Taylor's aide during a closed-door session on Friday. David Holmes told lawmakers Sondland assured Trump that Zelensky "loves your ass" and would do "anything you ask him to" when asked about investigations he sought, according to his opening statement obtained by CNN and confirmed by The New York Times.
Holmes testified, "I then heard President Trump ask, 'So, he's gonna do the investigation?' Ambassador Sondland replied that 'he's gonna do it,' adding that President Zelensky will do 'anything you ask him to.'"
Trump told reporters on Nov. 13 that he didn't remember any Kiev phone call with Sondland.
"I know nothing about that. First time I've heard it," the president said, adding that there was no quid pro quo "pure and simple."
The day before the call with Sondland, on July 25, Trump pressed Zelensky to open the two investigations during a phone call that triggered a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. That allegation is the focus of the House Democrats' investigation.
Even before the Nov. 13 revelation, Sondland had told lawmakers a White House visit for Zelensky – something the Ukrainian leader desperately wanted as a public demonstration of U.S. support – would be granted only after Zelensky publicly committed to the investigations Trump, and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were demanding. Sondland also told the House panel that he "presumed" U.S. military assistance was linked to a public Zelensky statement because there was no other credible explanation for a delay in that aid.
Sondland offered that testimony in a Nov. 4 addendum he submitted to the House Democrats after his initial closed-door interview. He said testimony from other witnesses had refreshed his memory about his dealings with Ukrainian officials.
Taylor's new information links Trump even more directly to the Ukraine pressure campaign. It also raises fresh questions about Sondland's diplomatic portfolio and qualifications.
"He's not someone who is trained either in the art of diplomacy or in the practicalities of information security," said Ned Price, a former CIA counterterrorism analyst. Price noted that in Sondland's initial closed-door testimony, he seemed to minimize the president's role in Ukraine by failing, for example, to mention the July 26 call and the link between U.S. military aid and the Biden investigation.
"I think he faces a decision as to if he wants to betray his political benefactor, or if he wants to risk his own reputation," said Price, who also was a National Security Council adviser under President Barack Obama. "Obviously he's going to be facing a lot of pressure because it's either him or Trump."
Trump has moved to distance himself from Sondland in recent days. "I hardly know the gentleman," he told reporters on Nov. 8. Before Sondland testified, Trump called Sondland "a really good man and great American" in a tweet.
Price and others say Sondland's July26 call with Trump raises red flags for another reason: It was likely a highly compromising security breach, and illustrates how lax Sondland was about following State Department protocols to protect sensitive information.
"The president is the most lucrative intelligence target throughout the world," Price said. "When the Russians presumably heard that he was connected to the president of the United States, they knew they had hit the jackpot."
Even before Wednesday's new disclosures, other witnesses had raised questions about Sondland's security practices and his unorthodox approach to diplomacy. Text messages and other testimony shows that Sondland spent months relaying Trump and Giuliani's demands to Ukrainian officials and other U.S. diplomats. Sondland has said he got his authority and instructions from Trump and Giuliani.
Before he amended his testimony, Sondland had told lawmakers there was "no quid pro quo" and that Trump relayed that to him directly.
"There is no quid pro. The president repeated, no quid pro. No quid pro quo multiple times," Sondland told lawmakers during his closed-door deposition Oct. 17. "This was a very short call. And I recaIl that the president was really in a bad mood."
But in his three-page amendment, Sondland said he recalled a Sept. 1 meeting in Warsaw with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky, in which he said aid wouldn't resume without investigations. "After that large meeting, I now recall speaking individually with Mr. Yermak, where I said that resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks," he said.

Texto completo: In recent years, Kacey Musgraves, John Legend and Gwen Stefani have all paid tribute to classic televised holiday variety shows, banking on baked-in holiday nostalgia.
If you weren't wearing your glasses during "The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show," you might have thought you were watching some sort of Cher retrospective. Musgraves, a Grammy-winning country star, was channeling the pop icon, from her shiny waterfall of black hair down to her many outfits including a feathered sheer bodysuit reminiscent of Cher's renowned 1974 Bob Mackie number. It was no coincidence.
Musgraves told The New York Times that her holiday special, which premiered on Amazon Prime last month, was indeed modeled after variety shows of decades past, namely Cher's titular show from the '70s and the Judy Garland Christmas special from the '60s -- "things that I love like that, but with a very fresh, modern take," she said.
In recent years, she is just one of a handful of celebrities to try to reinvigorate, but not necessarily reinvent, the classic TV tradition of Christmas variety shows.
This month, NBC aired "Holidays With the Houghs," a new special from the brother-sister duo Derek and Julianne Hough, and reran John Legend and Chrissy Teigen's "A Legendary Christmas With John and Chrissy" from 2018 as well as Gwen Stefani's "You Make It Feel Like Christmas" from 2017. Bill Murray's 2015 special, "A Very Murray Christmas" on Netflix, scored an Emmy nomination.
All were star-studded affairs, with Musgraves's a turnstile of A-listers. She duetted with James Corden, Lana Del Rey, Camila Cabello, Zooey Deschanel and Troye Sivan, among others. Kendall Jenner swung by for a skit.
"It started as a tiny idea over a year ago," Musgraves said, to bring her album "A Very Kacey Christmas" to life. Her vision: "an old-school sort of TV special with comedy and visually stimulating sets, but making it about the music."
Americans are in an era of peak nostalgia television, but when it comes to Christmas on TV, nostalgia isn't a phase, it's the bedrock. This month, the 1964 classic stop-motion animated film "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" (CBS) won its time slot, with an audience of over seven million. That same week, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" (NBC), from 1966, landed on top and "A Charlie Brown Christmas" (ABC), which first aired in 1965, was in the top three, drawing about five million viewers each.
"One of the properties of Christmas is nostalgia," said Robert Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture and a trustee professor of those subjects at Syracuse University. "All of a sudden at Christmastime, the old, the non-innovative, the old fashioned becomes an asset, not a liability," he said. "Parody, tongue in cheek, elbow and rib, irony are all good for modern entertainment, but at Christmas, they become an irritant."
Most Christmas variety shows play right into that sweet, earnest nostalgia but in a completely different way than the classic movies watched year after year. Variety specials shift and evolve -- with different hosts and guests, for example. Their appeal instead hinges on an enduring formula: dances, sketches, jokes and, most important, familiar songs in the context of stories about giving to others, family and returning to the hearth. (The Musgraves and Legend specials both brought family members onto the shows.)
"Variety is a format that goes back to the 19th century," Thompson said. "Vaudeville was doing that as far back as 1880, and then radio picked up on that."
Through the 1930s, '40s and into the '50s, radio broadcast musical variety shows. Within those shows were Christmas episodes, in which the star would sing Christmas songs and guests would come on and do Christmas sketches.
When TV emerged, and it was still experimental, shows needed to be done cheaply, and variety shows were cheap -- cameras could be mostly positioned in a single spot and the shots were interiors.
By the time TV established itself in the late 1940s and early '50s, some of the biggest hits were variety shows from Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle and Red Skelton. Variety television continued to prevail until the proliferation of rock in the 1960s. And while the 1970s offered up glitzy variety shows for a new era from standard-bearers like Carol Burnett, Flip Wilson, Donny and Marie Osmond, and Sonny and Cher, there were fewer of these programs and they usually had lower ratings than similar programs from the previous era. In 1976, "The Brady Bunch Hour," for example, lasted only nine episodes.
"Rock 'n' roll really delivered the writing on the wall for variety," Thompson said, essentially killing off the everyday variety shows, deemed culturally irrelevant. The time machine that is Christmas though allowed the genre to come back.
And come that festive time of year, come back it did. Some of variety's biggest stars like Burnett, Bob Hope, Perry Como, Andy Williams and Johnny Cash kept up the tradition of holiday-specific shows. There was even a "Star Wars Holiday Special" in 1978.
In the 1980s and 1990s, some of the more tenacious old-schoolers were joined by new faces like Pee-wee Herman and Vanessa Williams, who hosted their own holiday specials. And this century, an oddball mix of stars tried their hands at it, including 'NSync, Britney Spears, Ozzy Osbourne, Kid Rock, Michael Bublé and Lady Gaga, who hosted two Thanksgiving specials in the style of Christmas variety.
But it is those ever-changing components of Christmas variety that might be to its detriment as far as integrating itself into America's collective memory. "Nostalgia is like a barnacle; it needs something to latch onto," Thompson said. The sameness of classic holiday films provides that with "an infrastructure that makes them even more powerful now than they were in the first place."
Variety doesn't have that. "That's why Christmas variety shows are a lot harder to pull off from the nostalgic standpoint because you're not getting the original stuff, you're getting modern interpretations of that mode," he said, pointing out that old Como, Bing Crosby and Andy Williams specials aren't passed down like holiday films from those eras are.
That said, one indomitable annual variety program has defined the odds: Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which kicks off the Christmas season. It has aired on television since 1948.
This year, over 22 million viewers tuned in, scoring a 5.5 rating among adults 18 to 49 years old, the highest for any program since the Oscars in February.
How has it maintained its charm? By playing by the rules that made these programs appealing in the first place, which is that they're incredibly sincere, Thompson said. "If you're watching a Christmas special in the first place, you're obviously looking for something else besides cutting edge, right? Never underestimate the power of cheese."

California businesses at the breaking point due to minimum wage hikes

Texto completo: California’s minimum wage rises to $13 an hour on Jan. 1, and a number of its localities now have wage rates above $15 an hour.
Labor groups promised that $15 would be an economic boon for the state, while then-Gov. Jerry Brown worried that “economically, the minimum wage may not make sense.” The state’s experience with rapidly rising wage rates show the former governor was right to be concerned.
Consider the impact on the state’s full-service restaurant industry, which faces a double-whammy when the wage floor rises. California is one of a handful of states that doesn’t count tips towards an employee’s income; even if a server earns $300 on a Friday night, an effective wage rate of $60 an hour, his employer can’t count one cent of it towards the minimum wage requirement.
Restaurant owners are forced to give a raise to top-earning employees who take home far more than the minimum, with few options to offset the cost.
Paul Fraga, who announced he’s closing Sacramento diner Original Perry’s after more than 50 years in business, explained the dynamic. “For every dollar that [minimum wage] goes up, it costs me around $40,000…I can’t raise menu prices fast enough to compensate [for] that.” He added: “If they could sign a waiver, 99 percent of my servers would be against a minimum wage increase…”
Fraga isn’t alone in feeling the pinch from a rising minimum wage. Another affordably-priced option in town, the beloved Greek restaurant Opa! Opa!, announced that after 14 years in business it would be shuttering its doors. The owner said that since he first opened, prices have increased over 50 percent as a result of burdensome mandates placed on him by the state. Now, fourteen employees are left jobless right before the holidays.
These aren’t just anecdotes. Census Bureau data suggests the state’s restaurant owners have reacted to scaled-up wage costs by scaling back on hiring. In Los Angeles County, for instance, year-over-year full-service employment growth topped seven percent as recently as 2012; it’s fallen every year since then, and dipped below one percent in 2018. In Orange County, growth last year was near-zero.
A similar trend is seen statewide, with sub-one percent growth replacing five percent growth from as recently as 2013. In San Francisco County, stagnant growth turned negative last year, with the city losing nearly 1,000 restaurant jobs. A study published by Harvard University Business School and Mathematica examined the impacts of wage increases in the San Francisco Bay Area. The results were startling. The research found that each one dollar increase to the minimum wage resulted in a 14 percent increase in the likelihood that a 3.5 star (the median rating) restaurant would be forced to close.
Another study, recently released by my organization, found that in states like California with a high minimum wage for tipped employees, full-service restaurants hired 18 percent fewer tipped workers as a share of the workforce. In practice, that means full-service restaurants embrace self-service alternatives where the customer provides much of the service themselves. (The New York Times chronicled a trend in San Francisco of fine-dining restaurants adopting elements of fast-food style service models.)
Will California legislators wise up? Don’t hold your breath.
The state’s Future of Work Commission, which was assembled by the governor to examine future workplace challenges for employers and employees, is stacked with some of the very parties responsible for those challenges. SEIU president Mary Kay Henry, who co-chairs the governor’s commission, has overseen more than $100 million in spending on the Fight for $15, a policy that has forced countless employers to replace human employees with automated alternatives. Another commission member, labor activist Saru Jayaraman, has encouraged other states to follow California’s failed payment model for tipped employees. She’s been opposed in that goal by thousand of tipped servers, who understand the consequences for their own bottom line should their states make California’s mistake.
Gov. Newsom boasts that California is setting an example for the rest of the country to follow. He’s right; the state is showing the rest of the country why a $15 minimum wage is a bad idea.

Texto completo: In the weeks leading up to Christmas in 1975, my mother made a hard choice: Her marriage was dead and it was time to leave it.
My father had not been physically abusive, but he had also not been kind. He was a drinker and philanderer who had dishonored my mother, an upstanding and conservative woman who never caroused or cavorted.
My mother left with my brothers and me, a gaggle of little boys stretched out over eight years — from the oldest, at 13, to the youngest, me, at 5 years old.
My great-grandfather had recently died, shortly after his wife. Theirs was a love deep and strong. Her death hastened his. How to live in a world when the woman who was your world has moved into memory?
My great-uncle, a man who could neither read nor write, had lived with my great-grandparents his entire life. They had taken care of him. But, with his father’s death, he now needed another caretaker.
My grandmother actually owned the house my great-grandparents and great-uncle lived in, so this collision of unfortunate circumstances created an opportunity to solve two problems with one action: My mother, my brothers and I would move into the house because we needed somewhere to stay, and my mother would become my great-uncle’s caretaker because he needed help.
In the days before Christmas we loaded our meager things onto the flatbed of my grandmother’s husband’s pickup truck and ferried them across town to our new home. On Christmas Eve, as we stood in a nearly empty house, a call came. It was my grandmother calling from our new house.
She said Santa had just stopped there.
My brothers and I ran out of the house into the cold stillness of the night, jumped on our bikes and raced through the town’s streets toward the new house. My mother trailed us in the car, her headlights illuminating the way for us.
That was the last time I was ever in the old house.
We burst into the house, eyes aglow, short of breath, mood electric. Gifts ringed the Christmas tree. Nothing major; we were poor.
My mother had worked at a poultry processing plant, dismembering chickens on an assembly line before getting a job as an office assistant at the high school, taking night courses to finish her degree and eventually landing a job as a teacher.
But that one salary had to finance a family of young boys in school and an old man who couldn’t work.
We struggled. Many of our toys came from foraging rummage sales or picking through heaps of trash at the city dump.
My mother, being a resourceful and industrious woman, planted and gardened and bought some pigs and a calf. We would be poor, but we wouldn’t be hungry. I think part of her determination to make our new life work was also to prove all the folks in town wrong: the one who warned that half-a-man was better than no man, the ones who thought my mother was trying to reach higher than her station.
That is how I grew up: working a garden and chasing runaway hogs that rooted out of their pen. I grew up watching my mother make quilts so that we wouldn’t catch a chill from the winds that whistled through the drafty house. I grew up watching my mother clipping coupons and stretching two bags of groceries over two weeks.
This Christmas, please remember the people like my family: the poor, the people whose lives took a turn, those starting over, the fractured families, those working hard but not quite getting ahead.
It can be tempting in a strong economy like this one with such a low unemployment rate to overlook the poor. It can be easy in the consumer craze of Christmas to forget when we are splurging on gifts that there are people without food or medicine.
Poverty has declined in the U.S., but it has by no means disappeared. According to the Census Bureau, in 2018 there were 38.1 million people living in poverty, including 11.9 million kids under the age of 18.
And in this is a distinct and disturbing racial disparity: 20.8% of black people live in poverty, compared to 8.1% of non-Hispanic whites, 10.1% of Asians and 17.6% of Hispanics.
This is one reason that I was heartened to hear candidates at Thursday’s debate specifically invoking and remembering the poor. As Pete Buttigieg put it, “I know you’re only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but we’ve got to talk about poverty in this country.”
Yes we do, and there is no better time to remember the poor than on Christmas.

ELECTION 2020; A TV hitmaker pines for an America he once knew; For Norman Lear, defeating Trump is first step in fixing the country

Texto completo: And so, Norman Lear, how do you think things are going in America these days?
"When I'm asked a question like that, my mind goes immediately to the youngest people I know," he says. "It's clear to me that young people are not growing up in the America I grew up in. It's very different, and I worry about that."
So begins a conversation with the entertainment impresario and political activist, the man who created the bigoted Archie Bunker and then his antidote, the left-leaning advocacy group People for the American Way.

He is 97 and, on this day in Lear's lair atop the Morita Building in the Sony complex in Culver City, he is wearing a light-colored porkpie hat, blue jeans and a black vest covering a purple paisley shirt that's open at the neck. Plus white socks.
He says things like: "I think all the time about why I haven't been arrested."
He lets the sentence linger, perhaps intending to shock. But in truth the shocks these days are felt by Lear himself: shock at the presidency of Donald Trump, shock at what he regards as the perfidy of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, shock at how the Democrats are responding. There's enough shock in the room to light Los Angeles.
But there's some light too.
Lear is a barometer of political and social change, albeit one that responds to the barometric pressure on the right and then shapes the atmospheric pressure of the left. And right now his internal barometer records an important climate change in America and brims with short-term readings, especially about former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York:
"Of the candidates currently running," Lear says, "he has more experience with what I imagine will be most helpful as president. So I find him interesting. I've had a couple of meals with him. I like him. He's very smart and very interested."
He stops to make sure his listener understands the difference between the words "interested" and "interesting" and then, convinced that the point has been made, adds: "He's interested in life and things around him."
But mostly Lear is interested in defeating President Trump, and he thinks the Democratic field has some strong contenders.
"I like Elizabeth Warren. I like young Pete. But I have a sense Elizabeth Warren can make it. Long-, long-, long-term it would be healthy for the world to see a woman president. I believe she genuinely cares. I like the way she thinks of 'us.' "
How about former Vice President Joe Biden? "I think Joe Biden is last year's news."
And Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont? "I love Bernie. But I don't like him." Then this, about the face of Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican sculpting the GOP strategy to win a Senate acquittal for Trump after his impeachment by the House:
"I don't know anything I want to push a pie into more."
How has it come to this -- a pie in the face of the Senate majority leader?
"I made a crystal radio set on a cigar box, and one evening I caught a voice and heard a phrase about Jesus. It turned out to be Father [Charles] Coughlin. It was the first time I learned there were enough people to have a radio show whose star hated me because my mother and father were Jewish.
"From that moment I had a nose for, and a sensitivity to, anti-Semitism. I was that little boy when I started to see the [Rev. Jerry] Falwells and the [Rev. Pat] Robertsons and the religious right. I felt I had to do something about it."
Thus, People for the American Way.
"His love of country is the thing that may motivate him the most, and that his opponents don't realize," said Ralph G. Neas, the onetime chief legislative assistant to two Republican senators who served as president and CEO of People for the American Way from 2000 to 2007.
Not everybody likes Norman Lear, just as not everybody at the time liked "All in the Family," a TV show that revolved around Archie Bunker, the patriarch of a working-class family who spouted racist, homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic views. Daily Variety described Lear's signature series as "nothing less than an insult to any unbigoted televiewer."
The irreverent sitcom provoked Laura Z. Hobson, the author of a novel that explored prejudice in America called "Gentleman's Agreement," to write a New York Times essay that argued, "I don't think you can be a black-baiter and lovable, or an anti-Semite and lovable. And I don't think the millions who watch this show should be conned into thinking you can be."
Over the years, Lear has also given "Sanford and Son," "Maude" and "The Jeffersons" to television viewers in the United States and around the world. It is television that his longtime producing partner Brent Miller described in an interview as entertainment "grabbed from the headlines on a daily basis."
David R. Shumway, a professor of literary and cultural studies at Carnegie Mellon University, argues that "All in the Family" was notable for bringing contemporary political argument into American living rooms. "It was able to deal with controversial subjects and potentially offensive language by putting them in the mouths of characters who engendered empathy even in the face of disagreement or disapproval."
But for Lear, Trump engenders no such empathy in the face of his disagreement and disapproval.
"It angers me that the media doesn't call attention to the fact that he can be described in psychological terms," he says. "I feel qualified to say in some sense that he's not a well man."
And he has just as much contempt for congressional Republicans:
"Despite the fact I'm a Democrat and they're Republicans, I'm still a human being -- a father, a grandfather and a citizen of this country. They are too. I don't understand them as human beings, how they can allow themselves to be led by this president."
What ties together men and women of advancing age -- what ties together former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a post-bench crusader for political education, and Lear, who refuses to sit on the bench in today's raucous political climate -- is regret that civics classes largely have disappeared from the American secondary-school curriculum.
"My priorities -- the preamble of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence -- we are not as aware of them as we once were," Lear said.
Thus begins a riff from a man who flew 52 World War II missions out of Italy:
"We loved America in a way my children don't know how to love America.... We learned to care about America for what it promised, what it intended. We weren't fooled to know it kept all its promises, but it was on that road. There was reason to think, 'God bless America.' "
He goes on:
"I remember coming back from the war feeling that so keenly: Look what we did. And we helped Europe get on its feet again. We had leaders who taught the American people that we were the good guys and God's chosen. The passion to keep the promises dissipated."
While Lear is firmly part of America's cultural canon, he is increasingly a part of the American past. But with his indefatigable will, Lear is still focused on America's future.

Texto completo: Catch John Mulaney in a new children's special on Netflix, or celebrate Christmas Eve with a couple of holiday movies.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's Streaming
JOHN MULANEY & THE SACK LUNCH BUNCH (2019) Stream on Netflix. John Mulaney channels his inner Mister Rogers in this new children's variety special, which he describes as "a show for kids, by adults, with kids present." The comedian and the Sack Lunch Bunch, a group of children ages 8 to 13, share their biggest fears and tell odd stories in talking head interviews, variety sketches and elaborate musical numbers, including "I Saw a White Lady Standing on the Street Sobbing" and "Grandma's Boyfriend Paul." A number of guest stars join the fun, among them David Byrne, Natasha Lyonne and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays a manic, mustachioed entertainer called Mr. Music.
LOST IN SPACE Stream on Netflix. For another family offering from Netflix, consider tuning into the second season of this big-budget sci-fi series, a reboot of the CBS show from the 1960s. Set in 2048, the first season introduced us to the Robinsons, space colonists whose course was derailed and wound up on an unknown planet. In Season 2, the family is stranded on an oceanic planet without their trusty robot, forced to overcome a new set of hurdles. In his review for The New York Times, Mike Hale said this remake draws from a number of adventures and sci-fi classics, including "E.T.," "Star Wars" and "Jurassic Park." For those who wish to live in a time before reboots, all three seasons of the original "Lost in Space" are available to stream on Hulu.
What's on TV
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) 8 p.m. on NBC; stream on Amazon. Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" features George Bailey (James Stewart), a small-town businessman, who is contemplating suicide on Christmas Eve. A guardian angel (Henry Travers) is assigned to save him, and, to do so, he shows George what his town would have been like had he not been born. The film received five Oscar nominations, including best picture, but flopped at the box office when it was first released. Yet like many other holiday films that performed poorly upon opening, it has since become a feel-good classic.
WHITE CHRISTMAS (1954) 8 a.m. on Sundance TV; stream on Netflix. Set in 1994, this Christmas musical follows two soldiers-turned-performers (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who fall for two sisters (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) and join them at a failing resort run by their former commanding officer. The group tries to save the resort, and their newly minted relationships, from falling apart. If you have yet to see the film, Sundance TV is airing it all day long. That's seven chances to watch the stars perform the titular closing number.

Most Democrats prefer moderate policies, survey finds

Texto completo: Progressive policy ideas have dominated the early stages of the Democratic primary campaign. But Democratic voters may be seeking more moderate options.
Only 1 in 4 Democratic voters said they would favor eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with a government-run plan — the centerpiece of the “Medicare for All" proposals put forward by Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. And only 1 in 3 favors making public college tuition free for all Americans regardless of income, another idea shared by the two leading progressives in the race.
Those results, from a survey conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey, are striking because past polls, including those from the Times, have shown broad-based support for progressive ideas among Democrats. Last month, 81 percent of Democrats said they approved of Medicare for All; in July, 82 percent said they supported making public colleges free for all.
But those earlier surveys asked simple yes-or-no questions. The most recent survey offered respondents more options to choose from. And it found that Democratic voters consistently preferred policies that were well to the left of current law but were more moderate than those proposed by Sanders and Warren.
Most Democrats, for example — 58 percent — said they would like to make government-run insurance universally available while allowing people to keep their private insurance if they prefer it, a policy similar to the “Medicare for all who want it" plan proposed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and a related proposal from former vice president Joe Biden. A further 15 percent said the United States should reform the health care system without adopting a government-run plan at all, or that the current system was working well. Only 25 percent said they would prefer a Medicare for All plan that eliminated private insurance.
The preference for more moderate policies cuts across age groups, races, education levels, and even ideology: Among Democrats who said they were “liberal" or “very liberal," only 30 percent chose the most progressive option for health care reform.
The Times survey showed similar results when it came to “free college" proposals. About one-third of Democrats said that the government should make public colleges free to low- and moderate-income families but that the wealthy should still have to pay — again, a policy close to that proposed by Buttigieg. Another third said that college should be more affordable but that most families should have to pay something. The remaining third expressed the most liberal position, that college should be free for all.
New York Times
Key Democratic senator undecided on Trump
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, who won a special election victory in 2017 and faces a difficult reelection campaign next year, said Sunday that he remains undecided on whether President Trump should be removed from office.
Jones, a former prosecutor and moderate Democrat representing a deeply conservative state that overwhelming backed Trump's presidential campaign in 2016, said he is keeping his mind open ahead of the pending Senate trial, following the House's vote to impeach the president last week.
Jones and other Democrats who represent states won by Trump, such as Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, are seen by top Republican strategists as possible swing votes in a Senate trial.
But Jones is considered by party leaders to be the most vulnerable Senate Democrat ahead of the 2020 campaign season, because Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by 28 percentage points in Alabama.
Republicans who are being monitored ahead of a Senate trial include Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Mitt Romney of Utah, according to two GOP officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The Republican primary race to challenge Jones is crowded. Former attorney general and former senator Jeff Sessions has launched a comeback bid, and Representative Bradley Byrne is also running, as are former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville and Roy Moore, among others.
Washington Post
Buttigieg leads 2020 rivals in Wall Street contributions
The financial sector, blamed by progressives for spawning the 2008 economic collapse, is lining up behind Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign.
The mayor of South Bend, Ind., has collected more campaign cash from donors and political action committees tied to the financial, insurance, and real estate sector than any other White House hopeful, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.
The $3.06 million in contributions compares with $2.8 million directed toward former vice president Joe Biden and $2.03 million for Senator Cory Booker, whose home state of New Jersey has strong ties to Wall Street.
While Buttigieg is hardly alone in turning to the finance industry for support, the data could leave him exposed to further attacks from his progressive rivals, especially Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Democrat repeatedly hit Buttigieg during Thursday's presidential debate for his ties to large donors.
Buttigieg's campaign said Friday it has returned a $5,000 donation from one of Wall Street's most prominent lawyers, H. Rodgin Cohen.
Buttigieg's team argues his campaign has broad support, noting his average donation was $32 for the third quarter if 2019 and that 98 percent of the donations are under $200. Buttigieg spokesman Sean Savett said the candidate is “proud to be running a campaign that's powered by more than 700,000 grass-roots donors from across the country."

Tighten State Methane Regulations

Texto completo: The ongoing growth of the natural gas industry in Pennsylvania and nationally has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 10% since 2007, even though carbon output spiked by about 3.4% in 2018, according to the Rhodium Group, a private sector research firm that used data from the Energy Information Administration and several other sources.
Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas but it is less potent than methane - the natural gas that is being used to supplant coal for power production.
It takes far less methane than carbon dioxide escaping into the atmosphere to worsen atmospheric warming. But as the gas industry grows it is clear that state and federal regulators do not have a good handle on just how much methane leaks during gas extraction, processing and transportation.
Monday, The New York Times reported that a new satellite, the first designed to detect from space methane emissions on the ground, had recorded a record methane release from a well blowout in eastern Ohio that was more than twice as large as the driller’s estimate. Dutch and American scientists analyzed data from the February 2018 blowout and said it had released more than 120 metric tons of methane an hour for the 20 days that it took to plug the well.
That blowout was atypical. But if the driller and regulators did not know how much methane such a major event produced, that raises the question of how much methane escapes undetected during routine operations.
To help answer it, the Wolf administration has proposed a rule to tighten the state’s methane regulation. It would end an exemption for methane monitoring and repairs on low-producing wells, and would require regular inspections of production facilities regardless of the results of previous inspections.
It makes little sense to press natural gas as a partial answer to carbon pollution if regulators cannot restrict methane, which is more damaging to the atmosphere. Several major producers have agreed to the proposed rule. The administration should implement it quickly.

We salute Jamaica's newly crowned Miss World

Texto completo: A week ago the name Toni-Ann Singh would be just an ordinary name.
Today Toni-Ann Singh is fast becoming a household name not just in Jamaica but throughout the Caribbean and the Jamaican diaspora. Why?
Toni-Ann Singh was crowned Miss World 2019 on December 14,2019. News report indicates that 2019 marks the 69th year of the Miss World pageant and just to think that Toni-Ann Singh was chosen as number one out of 111 contestants! That's enough reason to celebrate.
As news of the newly-crowned Jamaican beauty spread near and far, there is a sense of elation that this kind of world class accomplishment brings. What am I talking about?
The sense of pride we felt when Usain Bolt earned the title of the world's fastest man or when other Jamaicans, like Shelly Ann Price, excelled in the Olympics. The fact is Toni-Ann Singh is the 4th Jamaican to win this coveted title. Singh is following in the footsteps of a line of Jamaican beauties who also won the Miss World title, Carole Joan Crawford (1963) Cindy Breakspeare (1976) and Lisa Hanna (1993).
This is a GREAT historic time because Toni-Ann Singh is the fifth Black woman to earn a major title and a crown. Notably, Kaliegh Garris, Miss Teen USA; Nia Franklin, Miss America; Cheslie Kryst, Miss USA; Zozibini Tunzi, Miss Universe have all made the headlines and have made it known to little black girls around the world that they too can be beauty queens. How wonderful is that?
I feel a personal sense of pride since I was also raised in St. Thomas Jamaica and therefore feel a certain sisterhood with this young lady. One of the main things that we have in common is a humble beginning. Regardless of that fact Singh's inner strength gave her the determination to keep working towards her goals. Singh immigrated to the United States at a very young age. She is a graduate of Florida State University.
Also, over the years St. Thomas is one of the Parishes that natives often describe as the "forgotten parish" because most of the island's economic wealth comes from the other parishes that are mainly vacation destinations. Despite the "misnomer", St. Thomas has produced a sure enough winner!!
The New York Times in an online article, included a very profound statement uttered by Singh after she was crowned Miss World. She indicated that she would use her title to work for a sustainable change for women and their children. This statement is an indication that Singh understands the struggle that so many women endure on a daily basis as they seek to maintain their families especially in the rural areas of Jamaica. Regardless of the fact that she is the winner of a beauty contest one of her statements was that her pageant win is so much more than vanity. She knows that it is a victory for her people, the island of Jamaica (her family, friends and countrymen)
Some excited Jamaicans, here in the U S., including Dr. Winston Whhe a long time resident of Miami Florida, commented "my first reaction to Toni-Ann S.ngh was one of criticism as at first glance she didn't appear to be tall as the others so I became skeptical. I'm also married to a beauty I must admit I am atways critical however after watching her interviews I changed my opinion. She is truly talented, poised, innocently beautiful and a true gem. Jamaica is blessed to produce all of these talented people."
Denval McKoy Fort Laudadale Florida had these comments "I am very el ated with the crowning of Miss World 2019." "The fact that she is from the Parish of St. Thomas, town of Bath, my hometown, makes me more proud." "This proves that no matter where you are from whatever someone believe and conceive they can achieve."
There is a Youtube video circulating that shows people from the town of Bath celebrating. There is no mistaking the jubilation among the people. They brought out the pots and pans, knocking them because they wanted their joy in the moment to be heard near and far. For them, this is family. ToniAnn Singh is one of their own. Her uncle, Theodore Bailey, said that she told him when she was just a tiny girl that she would win a crown. And she did. A win for one, especially on such a large scale (the world's stage), is a win for ALL.
Singh summed up her feelings in an emotional tweet: "To that little girl in St. Thomas, Jamaica and all the girls around the world - please believe in yourself. Please know that you are worthy and capable of achieving your dreams. This crown is not mine but yours. You have a PURPOSE."
Wow! You go girl.

Texto completo: One of the more poignant televised moments of the Trump administration was White House counselor Kellyanne Conway going on CNN and sharing a deeply personal detail of her history. Ostensibly there to comment on the news, she instead found herself - unplanned, she’d later say — clearing her throat several times before telling Jake Tapper, “I’m a victim of sexual assault.” Her voice trembled slightly, and then she jutted out her chin and continued with the job she’d come to do: defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and President Donald Trump.
It was such an emotional, unexpected moment, and I found myself wondering, not for the first time, what made Conway tick. How did she identify with, or not identify with, the #MeToo movement? Had she ever wondered how she might feel if someone dismissed her experience, as she’s dismissed the testimonies of the 20-plus women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct?
The first big-budget, post-#MeToo dramatization about sexual harassment opened this weekend in theaters around the country. It’s not about the liberal activists who invented the hashtag or the liberal actors and politicians who championed it. “Bombshell,” starring Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson, is about the toppling of Fox News founder and alleged serial sexual harasser Roger Ailes. So really, it’s about the experiences of a group of strong conservative women.
The characters in “Bombshell” suit up every morning in the Ailes-mandated uniform of short skirts and teetering heels because they dearly believe in the channel’s mission. They’re women who, after a producer in one scene mentions the New York Times, utter a collective, vocal “ugh.” In another scene, a devoted employee has a lesbian sexual encounter. Does she feel conflicted about sleeping with a woman? her paramour asks afterward. The Fox employee, noticing a Hillary Clinton poster in the bedroom, replies that she a) wants it to be clear she’s not gay, and b) is mostly horrified she slept with a Democrat.
More than anything, the movie is about women who repeatedly announce, “I’m not a feminist.”
Megyn Kelly’s character says it not once but three times. In a staff meeting about an upcoming presidential debate, Kelly, who will be the debate moderator, shares her plan to ask then-candidate Trump about his derogatory statements toward women. “Is this some feminist thing?” a wary colleague replies — as if only an unhinged misandrist would object to a man calling women “fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.” Kelly’s team immediately runs interference: “She’s not a feminist,” they say in panicked unison.
We could quibble here about the definition of “feminist” and argue that anyone fighting against slamming women for their appearances actually is one, at least on some level. But the relevant information is that Kelly doesn’t see herself that way. Neither does a fictional composite character played by Margot Robbie — an ambitious reporter named Kayla who cites watching Fox News as a cherished communal tradition in her family.
They don’t want to overhaul the system; they like the system just fine. They would simply prefer that as they moved through the system, their bosses stopped demanding to see their underwear.
“Bombshell” is a feature film, not a documentary, but it brings up interesting questions. How should a movement pushing for mass social change fold in women who are happy with the status quo? Who carry tremendous personal pain, but who are lukewarm on policy shifts that might stem pain for thousands of victims? And is feminism an identity or can it be actions undertaken by conflicted figures who drag stubborn institutions toward equality?
“My parents are Fox people,” screenwriter Charles Randolph shared at a recent Washington screening of “Bombshell.” As he figured out how to tell a compelling story of sexual harassment, he thought of his family. His mom and dad might doubt the broader #MeToo movement, but they could identify with Megyn Kelly; They watched her every night. Telling the story from her perspective, Randolph said, “would connect it to the idea that this isn’t a partisan issue. Maybe my parents would pay attention to a woman who doesn’t consider herself a feminist.”
At the same event, Theron talked about her struggle to portray Kelly, whom she finds emotionally inscrutable and politically distasteful, with the right notes of humanity. “I want to believe we can all be terrible, and we can all still have a moment where we shine,” Theron said.
Which is, of course, the way to think about it. Good women, bad women, liberal women, conservative women, black women, white women, rich women, poor ones — none of them deserve to be sexually harassed, ever.
What I appreciated about “Bombshell,” though, was its willingness to let the stories of these women be messy and complicated. Theron’s Kelly is ostensibly the hero, but when she tells Robbie’s Kayla that Kayla will be supported if she goes to HR to report her harassment, Kayla asks why Kelly never reported her own. It would have paved the way, she says, for more junior female employees. Kelly’s face turns stony as she explains she had her own career to think about. Her feelings about Ailes are conflicted. Yes, he grabbed her and forcefully tried to kiss her. He also championed her career and, at times, offered mentoring that was entirely platonic.
This feels right, and true to life. The #MeToo movement isn’t filled with saintly women and individual bad men. It’s filled with complexities - women who turn the other cheek because they don’t want to jeopardize their own success. Women who don’t immediately do the “right” thing because, frankly, it’s not even clear what the right thing is half the time. Women who have been harassed or assaulted themselves, but can’t believe that someone like Donald Trump or Brett Kavanaugh — or Bill Clinton or John Conyers Jr. — could be guilty of it. Abusers who have been genuinely wonderful friends and advocates to some victims, while making others’ lives miserable.
Even bad men aren’t bad all the time. They’re human, of course. And even “heroes” aren’t good all the time. They’re human, too.

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Lessons from Watergate on what impeachment should be for

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Texto completo: When Rita Moreno, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez were announced in October as grand marshals for the 131st Rose Parade, the selection was fitting.
Over the years, several past choices reflected California in some way. These three Latina women (a veteran Puerto Rican entertainer, Cuban-American actress, Puerto Rican-American Olympic gymnast) epitomize the 2020 “Power of Hope” theme in a state where Hispanics comprise the population’s largest ethnic group.
“Through their talent, efforts, persistence and dedication, they have achieved excellence and have given back to the world stories of hope, dreams fulfilled, dignity, respect and inspiration,” Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses president, said about the trio in a statement.
A look at the careers and accomplishments of the 2020 grand marshals:
Rita Moreno — who turned 88 on Dec. 11 — was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in Long Island, N.Y. She started doing Spanish voice-overs for American films at age 11. A couple years later, Moreno scored her first Broadway role and was soon starring in multiple film, television and theater productions.
The multi-faceted entertainer is probably best known for the performances that netted Primetime Emmys (“The Muppet Show,” “The Rockford Files”), a Grammy (“The Electric Company”), an Oscar (1961’s “West Side Story”) and Tony (1975’s “The Ritz”) — putting Moreno in the rare EGOT club. She also won Golden Globe, Peabody, Kennedy Center, Presidential Medal of Freedom and National Medal of Arts awards.
During the 1970s and ’80s, Moreno did guest spots on “The Love Boat,” “The Golden Girls” and “Miami Vice.” Other notable TV appearances include “Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego” (the animated series and its 2019 film version), “Oz,” “The Nanny,” “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” “Ugly Betty,” “Grace and Frankie” and “One Day at a Time.” In late 2020, Moreno will be seen in the Steven Spielberg-directed film remake of “West Side Story,” starring Ansel Elgort.
Having participated in the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, famous for one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s stirring speeches, Moreno still keeps active in social causes. Two years ago, she joined Jennifer Lopez, Gloria Estefan, Camila Cabello, Marc Anthony and others for the Hurricane Maria benefit single, “Almost Like Praying,” under the name Artists for Puerto Rico. The project was spearheaded by “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Gina Torres , 50, is a Manhattan native who grew up in the Bronx. She started singing as a child, attended a performing arts high school in NYC, trained in jazz and opera and was in a gospel choir. Torres appeared in Broadway plays and musicals working with acclaimed theater legends Tommy Tune and Jerry Zaks.
But her main focus was acting, and the 1990s saw appearances on such TV programs as “Law & Order,” the daytime soap opera “One Life to Live,” “Xena: Warrior Princess,” “Hercules: the Legendary Journeys” and “La Femme Nikita.”
Since the 2000s, the Afro-Cuban actress has gained a reputation for taking tough, confident female roles. She added some big screen work, notably with two of “The Matrix” sequels and more television appearances on “Alias,” “Firefly,” “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,” “24,” “The Shield,” “Without a Trace,” “Boston Legal,” “Bones” “Criminal Minds” and “Gossip Girl.”
Astute gamers might recognize Torres’ voice work on “The Matrix” and “DC Universe” online, as well as the “Destiny” series and “Lego DC Super Villains.” More recent TV roles include “The Vampire Diaries,” “Hannibal,” “Westworld” and “The Catch.”
Torres spent seven seasons as Jessica Pearson, the co-founder of a law firm on USA Network’s “Suits” and then transitioned to the short-lived “Pearson” spinoff earlier this year. She is now recurring on “Riverdale.”
Laurie Hernandez , like Moreno, knows her way around the dance floor, from jive to cha-cha and tango. She won ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” in 2016 with partner Val Chmerkovskiy. Hernandez is the youngest winner of the main competition to date.
The 19-year-old Hernandez is an Olympic medal-winning gymnast born in New Jersey to parents of Puerto Rican descent. As a member of the Final Five women’s team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Hernandez won gold in the team event and silver on the balance beam.
A 2017 inductee into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame, she is currently training at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa with an eye toward making the U.S. team again for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
Outside of gymnastics, Hernandez has authored “I Got This: To Gold and Beyond,” which covers her young life journey, and the children’s picture book “She’s Got This.” Both appeared on the New York Times Best Sellers list.
On television, she appeared on “Celebrity Family Feud” and co-hosted “America Ninja Warrior Junior” and also voiced the Valeria character on Nickelodeon’s “Middle School Moguls.”
Additionally, Hernandez serves as a global ambassador for STOMP Out Bullying, a prominent national bullying and cyberbullying prevention organization for children and teens.

Texto completo: EVERYTHING IS COPY
A few years ago, an essay in the New York Times' Modern Love column went viral for a good reason: It provided a recipe for falling in love.
The formula is simple. You ask your future soulmate 36 questions and then silently stare into each other's eyes for four squirmy minutes. The questions don't require you to solve Fermat's last theorem or posit an answer to the problem of evil.
They are, in fact, rather banal: Whom would you most want to dine with? What's your most treasured memory? Your most terrible memory? What would you save from your burning home? What would you change about the way you were raised? Do you have a hunch about how you will die?
Asked and answered, Cupid draws, loads and lets his broadheads fly.
Here's the takeaway: If you want to get to know another person in a meaningful and intimate way, ask them questions.
Most of my 800 first dates have followed the same pattern: A reasonably attractive and age-appropriate man will sit across the table from me. He will talk about himself and ask me not a single thing. After an hour, my coffee gone cold and undrunk, I'll check my watch and say, "Oh, look at the time."
He'll respond, "This was a lot of fun. Wanna go out on Saturday night?"
Um, no.
Here's the thing. I love hearing people's stories. I ask many questions and have managed to find a career that allows me to indulge my nosiness professionally. Listening to narratives of lives and experiences different from mine lets me armchair-travel through time and distance and reminds me how interesting most people are - if you bother to try to find out.
When I find someone who has a job I know little about (flight instructor, FBI agent, professional bull rider) or has expertise in an area in which I'm ignorant (pretty much everything), I'll happily listen for hours to lectures on anything from the latest ski technology to the baking properties of egg wash. I'm never afraid to appear stupid.
It's not always been this way. When I was much younger, I knew, well, everything. As a student at a fancy pants university, I learned to talk about books I hadn't read. I developed a bravado commensurate with my vast insecurity. It took years to get over the nagging feeling of being an impostor. And to embrace asking questions.
But these days I find I am rarely asked anything. I pay attention to conversational dynamics. I notice who is doing the talking and for how long, and how inclusive the exchange is. Far too often, it seems, we're playing the linguistic equivalent of a game of jacks. You take your turn, and, when you're finished playing by yourself, you hand over the ball. It's not about volleying.
Recently a friend told me about a book his daughters gave him titled "Your Father's Story." It seems to be not much more than a notebook with prompts, the kinds of questions that lead to love. He said he'd been thinking about which to answer first and how honest he should be.
I love the notion of creating an artifact that will last. How differently this book will read depending on where his daughters are in their own life stages and where he is when he writes. It's a way for children to see aspects of their parents they tend not to be interested in until, often, it's too late to ask.
The idea isn't new, and technology has made it easy for people to create their own oral histories. You can even do it with your phone. I like the book idea because I like books, but I understand that not everyone is comfortable writing.
But really, there's something about personal interaction, the ability to watch the changes in a person's face as she recalls a beloved childhood pet or he talks about the career in music he wished he'd been able to pursue, that is more difficult and important to capture. That's what creates moments of true intimacy.
We've become a nation of spouters. We sound off about politics, about the weather, about who's going to the Final Four. We say what we think often without asking the person we're talking to what she thinks. Social media allow people to rant into empty space.
The neologism "mansplain" might be sexist at its root, but the concept isn't gendered. Plenty of women have condescendingly explained to me things I already know.
When we want to know something these days, we whip out our devices. We call up facts and tutorials and rely on our devices more than we do our neighbors. I've had doctors give me diagnoses and prescriptions with instructions to google.
While we can in a few clicks find answers, I prefer a more interactive and human approach. I like seeing how people's minds zig and zag. I like engaging with them.
Now that we're living in an era when the thought of a holiday family dinner sends many into a cold sweat, the clouds of current politics chilling and darkening the room, I wonder how many tables would be warmed and enlightened if family members took turns answering basic questions about their lives.
What if, instead of listening to Uncle Charlie drone on about "kids today" and trot out the same old war stories, someone asked questions summoned by genuine curiosity. Why did he join the Army? What was it like for Aunt Rose to leave home at 18? Why did cousin Sally run off to an ashram, and why did she leave?
When people brag and boast, when they complain or assert their certainty, it's easy to turn off. But when someone tells us something real and true, something that reveals vulnerability, we lean in. We listen more carefully, and, usually, if we're really paying attention, we can't help but take their side.
That Modern Love column likely went viral because everyone wants a one-size-fits-all fix to getting what you want, and most of us are in the market for love. When it comes to dating, you'd think the goal would be to find out about the object of your right-swiping rather than blather on about yourself. But I think the bigger lesson is that we've lost the art of conversation, the sharing of personal histories.
Sometimes, all it takes is for one person sitting around a table at, say, a holiday meal to start asking questions and for everyone else to agree to listen. Some folks are happy to grab the mic and monologue. The more reticent need to be prompted and encouraged. Many of those who are unaccustomed to the spotlight have stories that will amaze and delight.
Who knows? You might even come to appreciate your least favorite family members.

Texto completo: Ken Rudy calls himself a word nerd.
He was trained as a comparative linguist, but spent most of his working life as a machinist.
"(Creating crossword puzzles) fills in for the academic career I never was able to have."
Rudy spends a lot of time cycling, hiking, backpacking and cross-country skiing, but he is always exercising his mind.
"I do read a lot and enjoy trivia and puzzles of almost any kind - in short, anything that stretches the mind and really makes you think."
Rudy said he has always been a crossword aficionado, but he hit a roadblock.
"For the longest time, I had a hard time completing any of the New York Times Sunday crosswords," Rudy said. "About a year ago, something clicked and they started becoming easy to solve most weeks."
Breaking down that barrier inspired him to begin creating his own crosswords.
"I haven't had anything published nationally yet, but I'm getting close," Rudy said. "I got some very nice feedback on my last couple submissions to the New York Times. That's the Holy Grail for me right now - to have a puzzle be accepted for the Sunday New York Times."
OK, the New York Times may have a few more readers, but just remember, Ken, you broke in with The Spokesman-Review!
Give Ken's samples a try. There are four crosswords labeled Cruciverbalist Potpourri. You'll find the answers at the back of the section.
Scramble this
Scattered about in today's puzzle section you will find excellent photos by The Spokesman-Review photographers combined with scrambled words that will test your local trivia knowledge.
These puzzles are perfect for a break from the real brain teasers brought to you by our friends at the national syndicates. They are not real tough, but they are popular and allow us to show off photos from our staff.
The puzzles were put together by our talented sports designer Madison McCord. He is used to slam dunks, touchdown spikes and home runs, not puzzles. He made the easy transition, proving once again that sports guys are agile.

Thankfully, Hallmark's gay wedding ads are back

Texto completo: "Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to error that counts," wrote poet Nikki Giovanni. She might as well have been writing about the recent mess at the Hallmark Channel, which in the past two months zigzagged from promises to be more inclusive of LGBTQ families on its TV channel (there are none currently), to yanking four commercials featuring two brides (calling them "controversial"), to completely reversing course this weekend and apologizing to Zola, the wedding planner company that had produced the ads. The president and CEO of Hallmark Cards, Inc., said the earlier action to ban the ads featuring lesbian brides "was the wrong decision."
Good for Hallmark. And good for viewers.
I confess: One of my guilty pleasures is watching the Hallmark Channel's Christmas movies, especially the royal fantasia "Crown for Christmas." Schmaltzy? Check. Unrealistic? Of course. Inclusive? Hardly. The lack of representation of queer people has been only one part of the Hallmark Channel's failed diversity efforts, which unfailingly presents "white Christmas" storylines, which is to say very few African Americans or other people of color in starring roles.
As an example, take the two-dozen holiday movies that Hallmark is debuting this month as part of its annual "Countdown to Christmas." "None center on a same-sex couple or feature LGBTQ characters," reported LGBTQ news website The Advocate. Fortunately, that failure to represent queer couples and families appeared to be coming to an end when the CEO of Crown Media Family Networks, the Hallmark Channel's parent company, told The Hollywood Reporter in November they are "open" to any type of movie, including with gay leading characters.
After all, it's nearly 2020. There are more than half a million same-sex married couples in the United States, now that gay marriage is legal in every state in the union.
Not coincidentally, before the Zola ads were pulled, the advocacy group One Million Moms, which is a part of the religiously conservative American Family Association and defines part of its mission as the "fight against indecency," hosted a petition on its site that urged Hallmark to "reconsider airing commercials with same-sex couples, and please do not add LGBT movies to the Hallmark Channel. Such content goes against Christian and conservative values that are important to your primary audience. You will lose viewers if you cave to the LGBT agenda."
(As of Monday, the petition had only 30,000 names, while One Million Moms has just about 97,500 "likes" on Facebook.)
Wait, wait – there's a gay agenda lurking within wedding planning ads? The only agenda I could find was a commercial one: The brides' guests would have arrived on time and purchased them nicer gifts if they'd used Zola, which brands itself as "the home of all things wedding."
A Hallmark Channel spokesman told the New York Times that the brides' "public displays of affection"– a typical lips-together smooch – were in violation of its policies. Well, that PDA policy wasn't uniformly applied, since the channel had approved two Zola commercials and, in one of them, the heterosexual couple kissed, too.
As I wrote in my book about LGBTQ etiquette: The acceptability of public displays of affection is about location, not sexual orientation. In other words, where you are (a club versus a church, the movies or the family dining room) and not who you are (a same-sex or opposite-sex couple).
To paraphrase Gertrude Stein: A kiss is a kiss is a kiss.
Do LGBTQ people still need to make the argument that we are families, too? That we are part of the fabric of American life, even as the Trump administration erases equal protections for members of our community? A Zola spokesman nailed it when he said, "All kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love."
Zola was joined by an outpouring of support from the LGBTQ community and celebrities, with the Twitter hashtags #BoycottHallmark trending at one point over the weekend. Ellen DeGeneres and Sandra Bernhard, who played an openly bisexual character on "Roseanne," also weighed in with Bernhard tweeting: "All the groovy gay ladies i know won't be watching your Christmas schlock."
On "Saturday Night Live" the Hallmark decision was mocked, and Netflix U.S., a Hallmark competitor, tweeted images from a TV show and film labeled "Titles Featuring Lesbians Joyfully Existing And Also It's Christmas Can We Just Let People Love Who They Love."
Finally, on Sunday, Hallmark Cards, Inc., did the right thing, with its president and CEO saying the network would reinstate the Zola ads and stand up for diversity: "Our mission is rooted in helping all people connect, celebrate traditions and be inspired to capture meaningful moments in their lives. Anything that distracts from this purpose is not who we are. We are truly sorry for the hurt and disappointment this has caused."
Thank you, Hallmark.
Meanwhile, the One Million Moms website lists a number of active campaigns critical of the supposed "LGBTQ agenda." Sure, you can try to erase us everywhere. But don't forget: We are here. We get married. And for now we'll watch sappy Christmas movies on Netflix and, yes, Hallmark.

Texto completo: Only Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have met the new criteria to take part in the debate, scheduled for Jan. 14 in Des Moines.
LOS ANGELES -- One day after seven candidates took the stage for the most intimate debate of the Democratic presidential primary cycle so far, the Democratic National Committee increased the qualification standards for its next debate in January, making it likely that the field of candidates will be winnowed even further for the event.
The announcement on Friday that candidates will need to receive at least 5 percent support in four qualifying polls or 7 percent in two early-state polls, in additional to amassing at least 225,000 individual donors, came despite intense public and private lobbying from Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and his allies to lower the barrier to participate in the party's debates. That cause gained momentum in recent days after just one person of color, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, qualified to participate in Thursday's debate in Los Angeles.
Five of the seven candidates who took part -- former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- have already met the newly announced thresholds for the next debate, scheduled for Jan. 14 in Des Moines.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a billionaire who is self-funding his campaign, has also met the polling standard but will be thwarted by the donor requirement, unless he relaxes his opposition to accepting contributions from others and is able to attract hundreds of thousands of donations in less than a month.
But two candidates who were on Thursday's debate stage in Los Angeles -- the businessman Tom Steyer and Mr. Yang -- will have work to do in order to qualify for January.
Mr. Yang, who has met the 225,000-donor threshold, has reached 5 percent only once in recent weeks, while Mr. Steyer, who is just shy of reaching the donor threshold, has met the polling mark twice. Only qualifying polls released between Nov. 14 and Jan. 10 will count toward meeting the thresholds, party officials said.
"Whatever qualifications they set, you know that this guy is going to be there," Mr. Yang said Thursday while touring a pop-up store selling campaign merchandise in the Fairfax section of Los Angeles. "The Yang Gang cannot be stopped. We are growing when other campaigns are shrinking and we are going to be there through the spring as the voting gets underway."
Short of a dramatic turnaround in his fortunes, the 5 percent threshold will doom Mr. Booker's chances of returning to the debate stage. He has not reached 5 percent in a qualifying poll since March. The former housing secretary Julián Castro, the only Latino candidate in the race, has never reached 5 percent.
Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, which puts out one of the surveys that can help candidates qualify for debates, said it currently only plans to release one qualifying poll before the January deadline. He added that it seemed unlikely that a total of more than four or five qualifying polls will be released in time for the debate next month.
"We saw a big gap in polling output because of Thanksgiving for this last debate," he said. "Now we've got an even longer holiday period where I don't think a lot of people are going to poll."
The January debate, scheduled to take place at Drake University, could be moved or postponed if President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate is taking place in mid-January. It remains unknown when the trial will begin or how long it will last.
Mr. Murray noted that the focus on impeachment could tilt pollsters toward conducting national surveys rather than ones in early voting states, which could hurt candidates who have had no choice but to invest heavily in advertising in places like Iowa and New Hampshire.
Three more debates are planned for February -- one each in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Mr. Booker on Saturday organized eight other Democratic presidential candidates to sign a letter to Tom Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, asking that debate thresholds be lowered in a way that would allow him and Mr. Castro to participate in the January and February debates.
But Mr. Perez spent little time considering their request. Instead he spent the weekend facilitating an agreement for unionized cafeteria workers at Loyola Marymount University, in order to avoid picket lines outside Thursday's debate, which took place there.

A Shamefully Hasty Impeachment

Texto completo: The investigation against President Clinton was thorough and nonpartisan. The Trump proceedings have been the opposite in every way.
As I walked into the House chamber on Wednesday evening, I had flashbacks to a sadly familiar scene. Just a day short of 21 years ago, I had cast my votes to impeach President Bill Clinton and was then selected to serve as a House manager -- a prosecutor -- to argue our case before the Senate. While the Clinton impeachment was a bitterly divisive moment in our history, I did what I believed -- and still believe -- was right.
This week, the sight and sounds were similar, but the underlying facts were vastly different. After evaluating the allegations against President Trump and the process that led us here, I determined that I could not vote to impeach.
Earlier this Congress, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, and Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, set forth criteria for undertaking an impeachment. They said that the evidence would have to be overwhelming and compelling, and, importantly, it would have to be bipartisan.
Looking back at the Clinton impeachment, I'm convinced we satisfied each of these. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, conducted a very lengthy and nonpartisan investigation, delivering 36 boxes of evidence to Congress. He concluded that the president had committed grand jury perjury and obstructed justice to cover his lies. Mr. Starr testified before our committee that the president might have committed impeachable offenses.
By this time, Congress had already established that grand jury perjury was an impeachable offense: In 1989 we had removed a federal judge, Walter L. Nixon Jr., for that very crime. When I delivered the opening argument in the Senate trial, I noted that we ought not to hold the president to a lower standard than we do a federal judge.
Fast forward to the present day, and things are drastically different. Just moments after President Trump took the oath of office, The Washington Post ran a headline, "The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun." Mr. Nadler later campaigned for the Judiciary chairmanship with the promise that he was best fit to lead an impeachment. Worse, 103 current members of the House Democratic caucus voted to move forward with impeachment even before President Trump's July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
Vitriol and blind hatred aside, President Trump has been robbed of his constitutionally protected due process rights. There was no independent investigation. Instead, Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, conducted a few weeks of closed-door hearings in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center. This is the same man who infamously stated on cable television that he had overwhelming evidence that President Trump had colluded with the Russians during the 2016 election. The special counsel Robert Mueller found nothing of the sort.
The closed-door hearings led to a railroad job in the House Judiciary Committee, where a majority denied those of us in the minority our rights. When we finally considered the articles of impeachment, they were so broad and flimsy that almost any other president could most likely have been accused of them. Article II, the obstruction of Congress charge, is particularly bad, as Democrats failed even to give a court -- the proper arbiter of these disagreements -- the chance to weigh in on the matter.
Further, none of the articles allege that the president committed a crime -- a drastic departure from the Nixon and Clinton cases. Nevertheless, Democrats prioritized haste as they jammed through their impeachment vote. Again and again, Democrats told us that Congress could not wait to impeach the president. Yet Speaker Pelosi's decision to withhold the articles from the Senate shows us that we can apparently wait. This whole exercise has been completely bunk.
Earlier this year, I wrote in The Wall Street Journal that an unfair process cannot lead us to true justice. The House impeachment inquiry and process was unfair, and therefore unjust.
A majority of my constituents in Wisconsin -- a key battleground state -- do not support the impeachment charade against the president. Rather, they ask why we don't wait a few months and let the voters decide whether President Trump should remain in office.
One fear, proffered by Al Green, a Democratic representative from Texas, is that "if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected." Apparently, the voters cannot be trusted. They might just choose President Trump. Again.
The real damage done by all of this is the precedent it sets. President Trump -- if ever tried in the Senate -- will most likely be acquitted. However, by lowering the bar of what is an impeachable offense and by failing to meet the Pelosi/Nadler criteria, we will all but ensure that all future divided governments will lead to impeachments. Mere policy disagreements will become charges of abuse of power.
The founders feared that impeachment might someday be used for solely partisan reasons. For 230 years, Congress had fought off that temptation. Unfortunately, in 2019, some let their disdain for President Trump lead us down this path.
I never thought I'd experience another presidential impeachment. As I walked out of the House chamber following my second, I felt saddened, not just for President Trump and the 63 million people who elected him, but also for future generations. If Democrats thought impeaching a president was difficult, just wait until they have to clean up their mess.

Texto completo: Why and how the young rule our time.
There are eras in history, like the 1950s, when older people set the cultural and moral terms for the young. And there are eras, like the 1960s, when it's the other way around.
The current decade has been in the latter mold. Its true beginning was Dec. 17, 2010, when a 26-year-old street vendor in Tunisia, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire, setting off protests that quickly toppled governments across the region. Now it approaches its end with the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg named Time's Person of the Year.
In between, the decade has been fundamentally shaped by the technological creations of the young, in the form of social media and mobile apps; by the mass migrations of the young, from Africa and the Middle East to Europe and from Latin America to the U.S.; by the diseases of the (mostly) young, notably addiction and mental illness; and by the moral convictions of the young, from the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements in the U.S. to mass demonstrations from Cairo to Hong Kong.
Why and how did the young dominate the decade? Let's narrow the focus to America.
Demography first. What history usually thinks of as "the sixties" (beginning around 1964 with the Civil Rights Act and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) coincided, in the United States, with the coming-of-age of the baby boomers, roughly 75 million strong. Our current decade coincides with the coming-of-age of millennials, another generation of about 80 million. More people, more power -- or at least more influence. By comparison, my generation, the underwhelming Generation X, numbers only 65 million.
Next, anger. History is often a series of reactions and counterreactions. We remember the nonconformism of the 60s as a response to the conformism of the 50s. This decade, too, has been a reaction to the last: to two wars that began in moral fervors and ended in strategic fizzles; and to a financial crisis whose victims numbered in the millions and for which nobody accepted blame.
Not surprisingly, this decade has been marked by the intense hostility of the young toward truisms that once governed our thinking. As they saw it, the liberal international order didn't uphold the peace -- it bled us dry. Capitalism didn't make the country rich -- it made the rich richer. Silicon Valley didn't innovate technology -- it mined our data. The Church didn't save souls -- it raped children. The cops didn't serve and protect -- they profiled and killed. The media didn't tell the news -- they spun it.
This hostility isn't manifest just on the progressive left. It also accounts for the rise of the populist right.
As for tech, not only did the young invent and shape social media, social media shaped and reinvented the young. This was the decade when algorithms meant to cater to our tastes succeeded mainly in narrowing those tastes; when the creation of online communities led to our Balkanization into online tribes and the dissemination of disinformation and hate; when digital connection deepened our personal isolation, vulnerability and suggestibility; and when the ubiquity of portable screens with infinite data meant there was always something more interesting to do than interact with the person before us.
One result has been a kind of shallowing of our inner life: of time spent wondering, wandering, reading, daydreaming and just thinking things over. Another result has been a shallowing of our political life via the replacement of wit with snark and of reasoned arguments with rapid-fire tweets and hot takes.
Technology had another effect: It vastly accelerated the speed with which previously outlying ideas became, in the hands of their mainly youthful advocates, moral certitudes.
Some of those ideas, like marriage equality (the single greatest moral victory of the decade) were long overdue. Others, like intersectionality, gender fluidity, new standards of sexual consent or the purported centrality of racism to American identity, are much more debatable. Moral certitude isn't the exclusive posture of the young. But it is an easier one to hold when life hasn't yet given you sufficient time to leaven idealism with experience, second-guess yourself and learn that the things you once thought were most true aren't quite so.
As with any decade, this one contains paradoxes and countercurrents. One paradox is the election of the oldest president in history. Yet Donald Trump, a baby boomer, embodies the spirit of the time as much as he rejects it, not least in his mastery of social media and the cynical, suspicious and angry nature of his politics.
One countercurrent is that some movements that have animated the decade are, at bottom, old-fashioned. So-called third-wave feminism contains a powerful streak of Victorianism. Similarly, the "resistance" to Trump is partly founded on the belief that moral character matters to presidential fitness, and that this president falls radically short.
Pedantic readers of this column will note that the decade won't really end until Dec. 31, 2020. They're right. We have a year to go before we can render a more final judgment on this decade of disillusion, and to begin to sense what comes next.

Texto completo: Dan Krauss's war drama arrives on Amazon, and "The Santa Clause" film series airs on Freeform.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's Streaming
THE KILL TEAM (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon or Vudu. The director Dan Krauss revisits the case at the center of his 2014 documentary "The Kill Team" in this war drama. Andrew (Nat Wolff), a young American soldier in Afghanistan, starts his deployment with fortitude. But after he witnesses fellow recruits kill innocent Afghan civilians, he second-guesses his brigade's mission and considers reporting their behavior. What stops him, though, is a terrifying sergeant (Alexander Skarsgard) and the possibility that Andrew's fellow soldiers would kill him, too. "Dramatizing these events makes them seem isolated -- a bad-apples incident," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his New York Times review. "The documentary had a more haunting implication: If you train soldiers for Hollywood-ready combat, violence on peacekeeping missions becomes inevitable."
MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (1974) Stream on Criterion. This classic whodunit adapts one of Agatha Christie's most popular murder mysteries for the big screen. Directed by Sidney Lumet, the film takes place on a crowded train in the 1930s, where an American tycoon has been stabbed to death in the dead of night. Conveniently enough, Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney), a Belgian detective, is aboard and jumps on the tantalizing case, interrogating the 13 occupants in the carriage (played by an all-star cast, including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery). The film received six Oscar nominations; Bergman took the sole award for her role as a Swedish missionary. The 2017 remake of the film, directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and Willem Dafoe, is available to rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.
What's on TV
THE SANTA CLAUSE (1994) 5:05 p.m. on Freeform. Freeform has been gearing up for Christmas all month long with its "25 Days of Christmas" programming. On Saturday the channel airs "The Santa Clause" film series, starring Tim Allen. In the first of the franchise, Scott (Allen), a divorced father and toy salesman, is forced to keep the holiday spirit alive after Santa falls off his roof. Scott throws on Santa's uniform, unknowingly agreeing to a legal technicality (hence the title) that ultimately makes him the new Santa. As the months go by, he grows a full, white beard and puts on dozens of pounds, perplexing and isolating his son and ex-wife. Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin called the movie a "clever, entertaining children's film with a realistic edge and a minimum of seasonal mush." The sequels "The Santa Clause 2" and "The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause" follow at 7:10 p.m. and 11:55 p.m.
TOP ELF 7 p.m. on Nickelodeon. The three remaining contestants in this holiday-themed competition series put their design and building skills to the test in this grand finale. The challenge? Give Santa's sleigh a makeover. Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy joins the judges Santa (Tommy Snider) and Ms. Jingles (Samantha Turret) in deciding who stands alone on the nice list.

Texto completo: The Justice Department and the giant company have agreed to amend and extend the legal agreement that allowed it to merge with Ticketmaster in 2010.
The Justice Department, in what it described as its strongest enforcement of an antitrust agreement in 20 years, said Thursday that it and Live Nation Entertainment have agreed to amend and extend the regulatory decree that allowed the giant concert company to merge with Ticketmaster nearly a decade ago.
Justice officials said the settlement came after the department found that Live Nation had repeatedly violated the existing agreement. Its investigation focused on complaints from competitors that Live Nation had used its control over the concert touring business to pressure music venues into signing contracts with its Ticketmaster subsidiary.
Such behavior, the Justice officials said, violated the terms of the consent decree that the government imposed as a condition of the merger in 2010 -- a deal that created a colossus in the live entertainment business and has long been criticized for giving the company too much power.
Under a proposed amended agreement that the government filed in federal court in Washington, the decree, set to expire in July, would be extended to the end of 2025. Live Nation would also reimburse the Justice Department for its costs in enforcing the regulations, but would not be fined.
"Today's enforcement action including the addition of language on retaliation and conditioning will ensure that American consumers get the benefit of the bargain that the United States and Live Nation agreed to in 2010," said Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general who leads the Justice Department's antitrust division. "Merging parties will be held to their promises and the Department will not tolerate transgressions that hurt the American consumer."
In its statement, Live Nation said: "We have reached an agreement in principle with the Department of Justice to extend and clarify the consent decree. We believe this is the best outcome for our business, clients and shareholders as we turn our focus to 2020 initiatives."
The adjusted decree would clarify one of its most contested provisions -- how Live Nation should conduct itself in the marketplace when it is selling its ticketing services and deciding where its artists should tour.
Under the existing agreement, Live Nation is forbidden from using the might of its concert-promotion division -- which puts on tours by stars like Beyoncé and U2 -- to coerce venues into signing exclusive deals to use Ticketmaster, which holds the contracts at roughly 80 percent of major music venues.
But the decree also allowed the company to "bundle" its services and gave Live Nation the right to exercise "its own business judgment" in making deals -- terms that some antitrust experts believe made the decree ambiguous and difficult to enforce.
The revised decree would be designed to make clearer the restriction that Live Nation is not allowed to threaten venues in any way, and may not retaliate against venues that decide to use a system other than Ticketmaster.
The Justice Department said it would appoint an independent monitor to investigate and report on Live Nation's behavior, and the company agreed to name an internal antitrust compliance officer. In the future, Live Nation will pay an "automatic penalty" of $ 1 million for any violation of the agreement, the government said.
Live Nation has long denied violating the decree, saying that it had not threatened venues and faces a vigorous field of competition in ticketing. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the new agreement.
In a court filing, Justice officials said they had identified "numerous instances" where Live Nation threatened venues with making concerts a condition of a ticketing deal, and other instances in which Live Nation "retaliated against venues by withholding live entertainment events because the venue chose not to contract with Ticketmaster." The filing did not specify locations.
But competitors had complained to investigators about several incidents over the years in Louisville, Ky.; Oakland, Calif.; Los Angeles, and other cities, where they said Live Nation had used its power over concert tours by major stars to strong-arm venues into using Ticketmaster.
In the incident in Louisville, in 2014, managers of the KFC Yum! Center, a 22,000-seat arena, were considering replacing Ticketmaster with a system run by Live Nation's biggest rival, AEG. But officials at AEG told The New York Times last year that they had received a warning from a Live Nation executive, saying the Louisville arena was likely to lose concerts if it dropped Ticketmaster.
Live Nation disputed the account and supplied data showing that since 2012, the number of tours it has sent to the KFC Yum! Center has increased.
On Wall Street, where Live Nation has been a meteoric stock in recent years, the reaction to the proposed settlement was largely positive. Analysts called the government action relatively mild, and said the settlement had removed a cloud of uncertainty that had been hanging over Live Nation.
The company's stock price rose more than nine percent after the settlement was announced, closing at $ 69.83.
"This is a positive outcome," said John Tinker, a media analyst at Gabelli & Company. "The clarifications seem relatively modest and reasonable."
Response in the music industry was more muted. Independent concert promoters, who vigorously opposed the merger and have complained about the company's dominance since, said they doubted the new decree would make a difference.
"It will have no effect, and will allow them to continue their monopoly position at the expense of the consumer and competitors," said Jerry Mickelson, of JAM Productions in Chicago.
As concert ticket prices have skyrocketed in recent years, lawmakers and federal agencies have scrutinized the market, concerned about fairness toward consumers and toward competitors. Those efforts have intensified over the last few months.
The settlement comes four months after Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota asked Mr. Delrahim to investigate competition in ticketing, pointing specifically to Live Nation and asking that the decree be extended. In their request, they cited an investigation by The Times last year that discussed the incidents in several cities where Live Nation's competitors had complained to the government that its business practices had effectively stifled competition.
This month, members of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust wrote to Mr. Delrahim with similar concerns, asking him to "take all necessary action to protect consumers and enhance competition."
A Justice Department official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitive nature of the investigation, said Mr. Delrahim had become similarly concerned that the merger had harmed rivals, led to higher ticket prices for events and hampered innovation.
Justice officials in the Trump era have been unusually aggressive toward mergers of companies who are not direct competitors, but operate in adjacent business lines, as Live Nation and Ticketmaster once did. For decades, such deals, known as vertical mergers, had been largely approved by the Justice Department because it is difficult to prove a reduction in competition or harms to consumers with such mergers.
But Mr. Delrahim shocked corporate America in 2017 by moving to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, the first major challenge of a vertical merger in three decades. The government later lost the case in court. Michael Rapino, left, the head of Live Nation, and Irving Azoff, then-C.E.O. at Ticketmaster, at the Hollywood Bowl in 2010, after the companies merged. The consent decree that allowed the merger will be extended by five years. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Monica Almeida/The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: A conservative talk-radio outlet in Denver canceled a married couple's show after the husband wished on the air for something to draw attention away from impeachment.
The conservative married couple's afternoon talk show on KNUS in Denver had been going for a half-hour on Tuesday when the husband made a remark that alarmed his wife, stunned their listeners -- and soon cost them their jobs.
"All right, Chuck Bonniwell, Julie Hayden here, a little after 1:30, talking about the never-ending impeachment of Donald Trump," Mr. Bonniwell said on the air. "Yeah, you wish for a nice school shooting to interrupt the monopoly--"
Ms. Hayden quickly interjected.
"No, no, not even," she said, according to a recording of the show that was later posted by 9 News, a local television station. "Don't even say that. No, don't even say that. Don't call us. Chuck didn't say that."
Mr. Bonniwell then tried to soften his remark by adding, "In which no one would be hurt," and the couple turned to the phone lines.
But the damage was done. The comment quickly attracted a storm of outrage in Denver, and on Wednesday, the radio station canceled the couple's show, which ran from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. A statement released by KNUS cited "the history of school violence that has plagued our community."
That history includes the death of one student and the wounding of eight more in a shooting this year at the STEM School Highlands Ranch in a Denver suburb. And it reaches back to the still painful memory of the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., 20 years ago, when two students at the school killed 12 other students and a teacher.
Mr. Bonniwell said in a phone interview on Thursday that he regretted his remark.
"We've been in radio for a long time," he said. "You're going to say lots of things that are controversial. You don't expect some things to be the end of your show. You can't do 15 hours of trying to be provocative and fun, and not say something that you regret."
"And so you get canceled," he continued. "And you always know that's a possibility. That's just the way the business works. We enjoyed the program and we enjoyed the listeners. There's no hard feelings."
In a statement on the couple's Facebook page, they wrote that "as journalists and radio hosts, we have covered every school shooting and tragedy since Columbine," including the grief of victims and their families.
"We have a child in elementary school who has to practice active-shooter lockdown drills and, like all parents, we worry about the safety and well-being of our child and his classmates," they wrote, adding, "Violence causes too much hurt for victims and their families and we truly did not intend to add to that pain."
The same radio station made headlines last month when its operations manager walked into a studio and fired a host in the middle of his show after the host, Craig Silverman, criticized President Trump on the air. It was not clear exactly what led to the firing, but Mr. Silverman said he believed it came in part because the station, which is owned by Salem Media Group, was "100 percent behind Donald Trump" and he was not.
On Thursday, to replace the canceled "Chuck and Julie Show," KNUS began airing a show hosted by Sebastian Gorka, a hard-line conservative who was briefly an adviser to Mr. Trump before being forced out in August 2017.

Polls Set the Lineup, Few as There Are

Texto completo: It has been over a month since any relevant state-level poll was conducted. So if candidates like Cory Booker or Tulsi Gabbard have made gains in early-voting states, there's no polling to show it.
Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .
It might be hard to believe, considering the constant chatter about who's up and who's down in the polls, but there's a lot we don't know about where things stand in the states that vote first in the 2020 Democratic presidential contest.
That lack of clarity is worth keeping in mind as you watch Thursday night's debate.
To make it into the debate, candidates needed to receive at least 4 percent support in four Democratic National Committee-approved polls (of either the nation or an early-voting state).
But no qualifying state poll has been taken since before the last debate, on Nov. 20. That means the lineup on Thursday may not reflect the latest state of the race.
If any of the candidates who were excluded from Thursday's stage -- like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey or Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii -- have made a recent surge in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, there haven't been any qualifying polls to show it.
"Indisputably, the polls lag," said Douglas Burns, an owner of The Carroll Times Herald in northwestern Iowa. "That's always been the case, and it's certainly the case where in social-media cycles things can turn quickly."
Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is now widely seen as a leading candidate, particularly in Iowa, and he is expected to face a new level of criticism from his peers onstage Thursday. But much of his reputation rests on the nine-point lead he amassed in one Des Moines Register/CNN poll last month -- the only debate-qualifying survey to show him with an outright advantage.
(He was shown in a statistical tie with his fellow front-runners in two other Iowa polls from early November. No other D.N.C.-approved Iowa poll has come out since the Register/CNN survey, which was conducted from Nov. 8-13.)
The ground in early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire is highly fluid, and fortunes can change on what seems like a weekly basis. Reports of momentum from the field often differ from what polls indicated a few weeks ago.
"There can be radical shifts, particularly in Iowa, over the last few weeks" of a campaign, said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University poll.
That's particularly true this year, when there is an uncommonly large group of Democratic candidates -- four of whom are bunched together at the top of the field. In most national polling averages, Mr. Buttigieg is at the bottom of that tier, behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
All nine of the D.N.C.-sanctioned polls that came out since the last debate were conducted nationally, not at the state level. In such a crowded primary, with months to go before most nominating contests, the national electorate's preferences are very much subject to change.
Besides, Mr. Murray said, most voters "are going to be facing a very different set of candidates than the ones that are on the ballot right now, because the field will get winnowed down significantly after the February contests."
"So the polls simply give you a sense of who Democratic identifiers think might be a good nominee, but are in no way predictive of how this process will roll out," he added.
Indeed, in national as well as state surveys, most Democratic voters still say they are open to choosing a different primary candidate. In a CNN poll released on Thursday morning, 61 percent of Democratic voters nationwide said they hadn't yet settled firmly on a candidate. That's compared to 58 percent who said so in CNN's November poll.
The seven candidates slated to appear onstage Thursday represent the smallest lineup at any of the six Democratic debates so far. Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer -- both businessmen who have been polling in the low-to-mid-single digits -- barely qualified. Other candidates with similar national polling, like Mr. Booker, Ms. Gabbard and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York (who joined the race last month) didn't make the cut.
After Mr. Booker failed to qualify for the upcoming debate, he led a group of nine candidates in writing a letter to the D.N.C. arguing that the debate-qualification criteria -- which include a fund-raising benchmark as well as a polling threshold -- should be relaxed.
"Candidates who have proven both their viability and their commitment to the Democratic Party are being prematurely cut out of the nominating contest before many voters have even tuned in -- much less made their decision about whom to support," the letter said.
But Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, defended the criteria, which have become increasingly exclusive as the debate season has gone on. "As we get closer and closer, you need to demonstrate that you are making progress," Mr. Perez said in an interview with The New York Times last week.

Texto completo: The Electronic Privacy Information Center says the United States lags in confronting the cyber privacy threat.
To the Editor:
Re "China's Blueprint for a Digital Totalitarian State" (front page, Dec. 18):
Your reporting on the acceleration of the Chinese surveillance model should set off alarm bells in Washington. The implications are far-reaching, not simply for the inhabitants of the most populous country in the world, but also for those who live in countries with which China trades, including the United States.
China's surveillance model is being carried forward in the Belt and Road Initiative, which extends massive systems of data collection and biometric identification in Asia and Africa. China also dominates the standards-setting process for techniques like facial recognition. And these surveillance systems are being deployed against democratic protesters in Hong Kong.
United States intelligence agencies are rightly concerned about the security risks of 5G, but little has been said about the privacy risks to American consumers. The Defense Department suspended purchase of drones manufactured by the Chinese firm DJI, but again there was no concern in Washington about the privacy risks of aerial drones that enable foreign surveillance. (EPIC urged the Federal Aviation Administration to establish privacy rules for drones, but the agency has so far failed to do so.)
The United States needs comprehensive privacy legislation to safeguard the personal data of Americans. We must also establish an agency charged with advocating for the privacy interests of America. Surveillance technology takes hold quickly. There is not much time.

Texto completo: Gross domestic product, fundamentally a measure of the total value of the nation’s economic output over a specific time period, always has been among the broadest measures of national economic performance. But, as noted in a series of columns by David Leonhardt of The New York Times, it also has been an indicator of individual financial wellbeing because wages and other indicators of personal financial progress often rose in near accord with GDP.
That especially was true for several decades after World War II, when vast manufacturing enterprises accounted for a high percentage of employment and powerful labor unions fought for labor’s share.
That started to change in the 1970s and has accelerated since, so that a graph line charting GDP growth still coincides roughly with the financial welfare of the top 10% of earners, but diverges sharply for the lower 90%, and by greater degrees down the ladder.
Now a group of Commerce Department economists is working on a new calculation of GDP that still would calculate the overall performance but break it out to reflect the economic wellbeing of different income groups, possibly by each 10% and for the top 1%. The department plans to issue a prototype statistical model next year, and the Federal Reserve already makes such calculations in a more limited way.
Congress should mandate the new calculation. As Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets, who oversaw the implementation of the GDP calculation, put it in 1934: “Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known.”

Texto completo: Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to two years in prison over racketeering charges stemming from his affiliation with the street gang Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, according to the Associated Press.
The sentence, delivered Wednesday in U.S. District Court, is substantially shorter than the maximum 47 years previously faced by the 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez. Judge Paul Engelmayer attributed the leniency to Hernandez working with prosecutors throughout the 13 months he has served: "Your cooperation was impressive," Engelmayer reportedly said. "It was game changing. It was complete and it was brave."
Last week, Hernandez wrote the judge a letter expressing remorse over the crimes he committed.
"I was blessed with a gift of an opportunity that most people dream of but I squandered it by getting involved with the wrong people and misrepresenting myself when I should have been true to myself and my fans," Hernandez stated.
The New York Times reported in September that Hernandez joined the Nine Trey in 2017 to earn "a stamp of street authenticity that would guarantee musical stardom."

Texto completo: The decision was a setback to efforts by a district attorney to ensure Mr. Manafort would still face prison time if President Trump pardoned him.
A New York judge on Wednesday threw out state fraud charges against Paul J. Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, dealing a setback to efforts by the Manhattan district attorney to ensure Mr. Manafort would still face prosecution should Mr. Trump pardon him for his federal crimes.
Mr. Manafort was charged in Manhattan with mortgage fraud and more than a dozen other state felonies in March, shortly after he was sentenced in federal court for similar crimes. His lawyers argued that the state charges covered the same conduct for which Mr. Manafort had already been tried.
Justice Maxwell Wiley of the State Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday, ruling that the indictment violated a state law against double jeopardy, which says that a defendant may not be tried twice for the same offense.
"Basically, the law of double jeopardy in New York State provides a very narrow window for prosecution," Justice Wiley said during a short hearing before releasing a 26-page decision.
The district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said he would challenge the ruling. "We will appeal today's decision and will continue working to ensure that Mr. Manafort is held accountable for the criminal conduct against the people of New York that is alleged in the indictment," said Danny Frost, a spokesman for Mr. Vance's office.
The ruling was a victory for Mr. Manafort, whose lawyers maintained from the start that Mr. Vance, a liberal Democrat, had brought the indictment for political reasons.
"We have said since the day this indictment was made public that it was politically motivated and violated New York's statutory double jeopardy law," Mr. Manafort's lawyer, Todd Blanche, said in a statement. "Today's decision is a stark reminder that the law and justice should always prevail over politically motivated actions."
The move by Mr. Vance was widely seen as a way to ensure that Mr. Manafort, who had been convicted of conspiracy and tax and bank fraud in two federal cases, would still face charges if the president pardoned him.
"No one is above the law in New York," Mr. Vance said at the time, adding that his investigation had "yielded serious criminal charges for which the defendant has not been held accountable."
Mr. Trump has never said he intended to pardon his former campaign chairman. But he has often spoken of his power to pardon and has defended Mr. Manafort on several occasions, calling him a "brave man."
The 16-count state indictment accused Mr. Manafort, 70, of falsifying business records to obtain millions of dollars in loans. It grew out of an investigation that began in 2017, when the Manhattan prosecutors began examining loans Mr. Manafort received from two banks.
Mr. Manafort's lawyers had argued that the state charges should be dismissed and that the factual overlap between the federal and state cases was extensive.
Mr. Manafort did not appear in court on Wednesday. He has been hospitalized since last week, after suffering a cardiac ailment while serving seven and a half years in federal prison in Pennsylvania.
The charges against Mr. Manafort stemmed from allegations that between December 2015 and January 2017 he submitted false documentation to get mortgages from three financial institutions, defrauding them of more than $ 20 million. Prosecutors also accused Mr. Manafort of falsifying documents to obtain a $ 1 million line of credit from Banc of California.
It is a settled legal principle, set out in the Constitution, that a defendant may not be prosecuted twice for the same crime.
New York State law provides even stronger protections against double jeopardy, with some exceptions. The double jeopardy law goes into effect as soon as a jury is sworn in a criminal case, whether or not the defendant is eventually convicted or acquitted.
Sometimes, however, juries reach an impasse and cannot decide on a verdict on a particular charge, which is what happened with several counts in Mr. Manafort's federal case in Virginia.
Mr. Vance's office saw the Virginia jury's inability to reach a verdict on those counts as an opportunity to pursue state charges in New York that included falsifying business records or mortgage fraud. The state charges concerned some of the same loans noted in the Virginia case. Those loans had been issued by Citizens Bank in Rhode Island and Federal Savings Bank in Chicago.
But Justice Wiley said in his opinion on Wednesday that the district attorney's interpretation was incorrect and that prosecutors could not resurrect charges that a jury had not decided on in a preceding case.
Justice Wiley wrote that "this is not a case in which the defendant's constitutional rights are at issue," but rather that "New York courts have not yet been required to answer the question of whether this exception can apply to the two sets of federal and state fraud statutes charged in the successive prosecutions here."
Some conservatives saw Mr. Vance's attempt to prosecute Mr. Manafort as a politically motivated attack, contending that Mr. Vance was targeting a member of President Trump's inner circle.
Mr. Vance also had been harshly criticized by liberals in 2017 for not bringing charges against two of Mr. Trump's children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., after his office investigated allegations that they had misled buyers of units at the Trump SoHo, a 46-story luxury condominium-hotel in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Vance has defended his handling of that case, saying he ended it largely because the victims stopped cooperating with prosecutors after they reached a civil settlement with the Trumps and their business partners.
In August 2018, a federal jury in Alexandria, Va., convicted Mr. Manafort of using foreign accounts to hide millions of dollars from his political consulting work in Ukraine, of tax fraud and of lying to banks to obtain millions of dollars in loans.
A month later, Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty to crimes ranging from money laundering to obstruction of justice in a federal court in Washington, D.C.
In March, a judge sentenced him to four years in prison in the Virginia case. Six days later, the judge overseeing the Washington case ordered Mr. Manafort to serve an additional three and a half years, calling him a man who had "spent a significant portion of his career gaming the system."

Texto completo: A dark reimagining of "A Christmas Carol" debuts on FX. And an unusual documentary is on Hulu.
What's on TV
A CHRISTMAS CAROL 7:30 p.m. on FX. Tombstones, darkness and cold all feature prominently in this bleak Charles Dickens rethink. Created for FX and BBC One by Steven Knight (best known for "Peaky Blinders"), this three-part, not-for-kids version of the Christmas staple stars Guy Pearce as Ebenezer Scrooge, who travels back to his childhood with the Ghost of Christmas Past (given eerie form here by Andy Serkis). The journey touches on some heavy subjects: sexual abuse, neglect (particularly by Scrooge's father, played by Johnny Harris) and other cruelties. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Knight explained the reasoning behind some of the show's more disturbing elements -- like the abuse -- that make for an especially troubling telling of the story. "I wanted to look at these things, not to disrupt or be shocking, but to say the things one can say now," he said. "I am trying to make some suggestions about why Scrooge is Scrooge."
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) 4:40 p.m. on Freeform. For a more child-friendly tale of holiday repentance (with a far wider color palette), consider revisiting this lavish Dr. Seuss adaptation, which stars Jim Carrey as the ornery green Grinch. Directed by Ron Howard, this version gives the Grinch a back story -- like "A Christmas Carol," it involves a troubled childhood -- and a playground of special effects. "Every so often, beneath the layers of gadgetry and glitter and its two million feet of Styrofoam (according to the production notes), you can glimpse what might have been an enchanted family movie," Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. Discerning children will likely prefer the 1966 animated version, which is available to rent on streaming platforms including Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
IHEARTRADIO JINGLE BALL 2019 8 p.m. on the CW. Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Lizzo, the Jonas Brothers and Camila Cabello were among the performers in the latest edition of iHeartRadio's annual gathering of Top 40 acts, presented as a series of concerts across the country. Footage of some of the highlights will air in a 90-minute special Thursday night.
What's Streaming
COLD CASE HAMMARSKJOLD (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The Danish filmmaker Mads Brugger won a directing award at this year's Sundance Film Festival for this proudly odd documentary about the 1961 death of Dag Hammarskjold, then the secretary general of the United Nations. The film ostensibly aims to shed light on what led to Hammarskjold's demise -- he died in a plane crash that has long fueled speculation and conspiracy theories -- but is mysterious in and of itself. "If you were to assign a filmmaker to sift fact from conjecture, one of the last people you would trust is Brugger, who has built a career -- in movies like 'The Red Chapel' and 'The Ambassador' -- on combining reportage with pranksmanship," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times. The documentary, Kenigsberg added, is "poised unsatisfyingly between an explosive exposé and a self-conscious put-on."

U.S. Entitled to Snowden's Proceeds From Book and Speeches, Judge Says

Texto completo: The former intelligence contractor did not let federal intelligence agencies vet his book before it was published in breach of his agreements with the agencies, the judge said.
The federal government is entitled to the former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden's proceeds from his new memoir and from several of his paid speeches because he did not submit the material, which referenced intelligence activities, to federal agencies in advance, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
Judge Liam O'Grady of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., said in his ruling that Mr. Snowden, who disclosed top-secret documents in 2013 about National Security Agency surveillance programs, had previously signed agreements with the C.I.A. and the N.S.A. allowing them to review disclosures about certain intelligence-related work before he made them public.
In his memoir published in September, "Permanent Record," Mr. Snowden recounts how he came to be alarmed by the growth of the security agency's surveillance capabilities -- including its then-secret systematic collection of logs of Americans' domestic phone calls -- and how he copied documents and provided them to the news media.
He did not submit the book for review, and the Justice Department sued Mr. Snowden, seeking to seize his proceeds from it, the same day it was published.
Mr. Snowden had argued that the government had said it would not review his materials in good faith and within a reasonable time. He also argued that he should be allowed to find out whether the federal government was singling him out and had "resolved not to permit him to earn a living by speaking or writing," according to an earlier legal filing.
But Judge O'Grady disagreed, saying in a 14-page opinion on Tuesday that the memoir "contains information which both the C.I.A. and N.S.A. Secrecy Agreements obligated Snowden to submit for prepublication review." Judge O'Grady said visual aids used by Mr. Snowden in speeches also should have been submitted for review -- Mr. Snowden had used them at a TED Conference, an internet security trade fair and two universities, the judge noted.
Brett Max Kaufman, a lawyer for Mr. Snowden, said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that it was "far-fetched to believe that the government would have reviewed Mr. Snowden's book or anything else he submitted in good faith."
"For that reason, Mr. Snowden preferred to risk his future royalties than to subject his experiences to improper government censorship," Mr. Kaufman said.
It was not immediately clear if Mr. Snowden would appeal the ruling, but Mr. Kaufman said "we disagree with the court's decision and will review our options."
The United States attorney's office in Alexandria, Va., referred questions to the Justice Department in Washington. The department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
The ruling on Tuesday addressed only Mr. Snowden's liability for breaching his agreements with the intelligence agencies, not how much the government would seek to recover or how it would do so. The lawsuit against Mr. Snowden also named his publisher, Macmillan, as a defendant, but prosecutors have said they were only seeking to prevent the company from paying royalties to Mr. Snowden that should instead be turned over to the federal government.
Mr. Snowden has been celebrated as a whistle-blower by advocates for privacy and civil liberties but denounced as a traitor by some national security officials. His disclosure in 2013 prompted a worldwide debate about the reach of modern government-surveillance programs.
It also prompted reforms. In 2015, Congress ended the N.S.A.'s collection of logs of Americans' phone records. The Trump administration asked Congress in August to reauthorize an alternative surveillance system.
In 2013, federal prosecutors charged Mr. Snowden with violations of the Espionage Act, which outlaws the disclosure of potentially harmful national security information to someone not authorized to receive it.
Mr. Snowden, however, has been living as a fugitive in Russia and the case has not proceeded. He has said that paid lectures are one of his main forms of income there.
Consenting to prepublication review is a routine part of gaining a security clearance.
But Tuesday's ruling came as groups, including the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University and American Civil Liberties Union, are challenging the process, arguing in a lawsuit filed in April by former military and intelligence officials that it is "dysfunctional" and unjustifiably restrictive of free-speech and due-process rights.
The lawsuit said reviewing officials can delay or discriminate against lower-ranking people who criticize government actions while quickly clearing favorable memoirs and other writings by retired senior officials.
Federal officials have said they are working on a new policy for the reviews.
Mr. Snowden's memoir debuted at No. 2 on the New York Times best-seller lists for both hardcover nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction on Oct. 6. The list used sales information from Sept. 15 to Sept. 21.
In an interview on "The Daily Show With Trevor Noah" in September, Mr. Snowden said the government's lawsuit had helped popularize the memoir.
"You can say the attorney general is the best hype man that I've ever had," he said.

Texto completo: The ride-hailing company "permitted a culture of sexual harassment and retaliation," the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found.
SAN FRANCISCO -- In 2017, a former Uber employee wrote a public essay describing how the ride-hailing company had permitted sexual harassment to fester at the workplace.
The revelations led to an outcry over Uber's toxic culture. Federal authorities and others began investigations into the company. More than 20 employees were later fired over their part in the behavior. And the disclosures raised questions about Uber's growth-at-all-costs mentality, resulting in the ouster of Travis Kalanick, a co-founder and then the chief executive.
On Wednesday, Uber resolved one investigation into its workplace culture. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has been examining the company since 2017, said it had "found reasonable cause to believe that Uber permitted a culture of sexual harassment and retaliation against individuals who complained about such harassment."
Uber said it had agreed to a settlement with the agency by establishing a $ 4.4 million fund to pay current and former employees who were sexually harassed at work. It also agreed to three years of monitoring by a former agency commissioner to ensure that it changes its practices.
"This agreement will hopefully empower women in technology to speak up against sexism in the workplace knowing that their voices can yield meaningful change," Ami Sanghvi, a trial lawyer with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who consulted on the investigation, said in a statement.
Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, said the company had "worked hard to ensure that all employees can thrive at Uber by putting fairness and accountability at the heart of who we are and what we do" and was working with the commission to improve those efforts.
The settlement showed how Uber was addressing the repercussions of its internal conduct more than two years after the envelope-pushing behavior of its executives and employees first came to light.
The company remains under investigation by the Justice Department over a tool it created to help it evade scrutiny by law enforcement authorities. It is also the subject of a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission over its privacy practices until 2038. Last month, the authorities in London said they would not extend the company's license to operate there because Uber did not meet the "fit and proper" standard needed to hold a taxi license.
Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, pledged to turn around Uber when he joined the company in late 2017, saying that his motto was "do the right thing." He then replaced much of the senior leadership, eliminated a mandatory arbitration provision for sexual assault and harassment claims against the company, and said that executive compensation would be tied to whether or not Uber reached its goals for hiring a more diverse staff.
Uber has also tried to be more transparent about its track record on safety and harassment. This month, it released its first report documenting the number of sexual assaults that occurred in the United States during Uber rides. Uber said it had counted 3,045 sexual assaults in 2018, which it said represented a small fraction of its rides.
Uber's workplace culture first became an issue in February 2017 when a former engineer, Susan Fowler, detailed how her complaints about sexual harassment at the company were brushed aside because the man who had harassed her was considered a high performer. Ms. Fowler now works as an editor at The New York Times.
"The tech industry, among others, has often ignored allegations of sexual harassment when an accused harasser is seen as more valuable to the company than the accuser," said William Tamayo, the San Francisco district director of the employment commission.
In the aftermath, Mr. Kalanick faced scrutiny for putting growth ahead of how Uber's employees were treated. Uber was also found to have engaged in other dubious tactics to protect its business, including using data collected from its app and other techniques to identify and sidestep law enforcement, a scheme known as "Greyball."
As part of the settlement announced on Wednesday, Uber employees who worked at the company after January 2014 will be eligible to submit claims to the commission.
Uber said it would also develop tools to help it respond proactively to harassment accusations. The company said it would begin identifying employees who have been the subject of more than one harassment complaint, and identify managers who don't respond quickly when their employees raise complaints of harassment.
A spokeswoman for the commission said it was pleased with the $ 4.4 million settlement, which is a tiny amount for Uber. The company's revenue totaled $ 3.8 billion in its most recent quarter. In October, Intel paid $ 5 million as part of a settlement with the Labor Department over allegations of pay discrimination.

Texto completo: A middle-distance runner from New Zealand, he set world records in five events and won three Olympic gold medals.
Peter Snell, a middle-distance runner from New Zealand who set world records in five events and became a three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1960s, died on Thursday at his home in Dallas. He was 80.
His wife, Miki, confirmed the death to The New Zealand Herald. She said he had had a longstanding heart ailment.
Snell was a virtual unknown on the international track scene when he surged in the stretch of the 800-meter race at the 1960 Rome Olympics to overtake Roger Moens of Belgium, who held the world record.
"I went to Rome hoping to make the final," Snell was quoted as saying in SunMedia, a conglomerate of newspapers in New Zealand. "It was hard to believe that suddenly I was an Olympic champion. I recall looking up to the giant results board above the track and seeing P G Snell NZL at the top of the list. That was one of the great thrills of my life."
Murray Halberg, also from New Zealand, won the 5,000-meter race on the same day that Snell took the 800 meters.
Snell won both the 800 meters and the 1,500 meters at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, matching a record for gold in those events in a single Olympics that had been set by Albert Hill of Britain at the 1920 Antwerp Games.
In January 1962, racing at Whanganui, in New Zealand, Snell ran a mile in 3 minutes 54.4 seconds, breaking the world record held by Herb Elliott of Australia by one-tenth of a second. He eclipsed his own record by three-tenths of a second in November 1964, this time in Auckland. Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who ran the mile in 3:43.13 at Rome in 1999, is the current record-holder.
Snell also set world records for 800 meters, 880 yards and 1,000 meters, and as a team member in the 4x1-mile relay. He won gold medals at 880 yards and the mile at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth, Australia, in 1962.
But for all the acclaim he had received internationally, he chose to settle in the United States in the 1970s and live a quiet life working at a research center in Dallas, where he focused on the effects of aerobic exercise on cardiac health.
Peter George Snell was born on Dec. 17, 1938, in the New Zealand beach town of Opunake, to George and Margaret Snell. His father was an electrical engineer.
He excelled at many sports as a teenager and at 19 began working with the prominent middle-distance and long-distance trainer Arthur Lydiard, a New Zealand coach who emphasized slow but grueling long-distance training runs to build stamina. Snell, who was 5-foot-10 and powerfully built, ran up to 100 miles a week in training for the Olympics.
"I don't think tactics count too much above simple common sense," he told The New York Times in 1965, his last year on the international racing circuit. "Conditioning is the main factor, and determination makes you get in good physical condition."
After retiring from competitive racing, Snell worked in sports promotions for the tobacco company Rothmans International, making speeches and giving clinics at a time before such sponsorships became a matter of controversy.
"Rothmans had sent me on a year's sabbatical to London in the 1970s, and I wound up reading all this scientific literature," he told The Dallas Morning News in 1983. "I got hooked. I really changed. I came back to New Zealand and worked for another year or so, after that realizing that I really wanted to change my career."
Snell earned a bachelor of science degree in human performance from the University of California, Davis, and a doctorate in exercise physiology from Washington State University. In 1981 he became a research fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
He later became an associate professor at the university and was director of its Human Performance Center.
Snell said that he "really wanted to know what made athletes tick" and that he hoped "to understand why Arthur Lydiard's training methods worked so well," he wrote in "Peter Snell: From Olympian to Scientist" (2007), a collaboration with Garth Gilmour.
He found that it would be easier to do that sort of work out of the spotlight, in America.
"There are big advantages in being able to be anonymous, and one of them is that you have to rely on your other attributes in order to make progress and achieve things," he told the magazine New Zealand Listener in 2004. "If I was still living here in New Zealand, I'd be tending to think that I deserved to be given things or treated differently or whatever."
In addition to his wife, whom he married in the early 1980s, Snell's survivors include two daughters, Amanda and Jacqui, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce.
Snell became an American citizen in 1994. In 2009 he was knighted by New Zealand, and in 2012 he was one of 24 inaugural members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Hall of Fame.
Mike Stanley, the New Zealand Olympic Committee president, said in a statement upon Snell's death that "his achievements are at the heart of New Zealand's sporting history and have helped shape our national identity."

Texto completo: A Vietnam veteran with decades of State Department experience, William B. Taylor Jr. sharply objected to what he saw as the Trump administration's shadow foreign policy in Ukraine.
WASHINGTON -- William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine who described for Congress and the public what he saw as President Trump's efforts to pressure Kyiv to go after political rivals, said on Tuesday that he was stepping down from his post.
In a brief email to The New York Times, Mr. Taylor said he would leave in early January because his temporary appointment to Ukraine last June is set to expire. Under the Vacancies Act, political appointees in an acting position can hold office only for about 200 days. Earlier in the day, people familiar with the planning had suggested he would leave by the end of December.
"The administration will nominate a permanent ambassador soon," Mr. Taylor said. He did not elaborate. His departure was first reported by NBC.
Mr. Taylor served as something of a star witness for the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump. In public testimony last month, he calmly and confidently recounted for lawmakers what he described as a pressure campaign by the Trump administration to leverage American security aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into Mr. Trump's political opponents.
"Security was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interests," Mr. Taylor testified at the Nov. 13 hearing. "To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy."
At the hearing, Mr. Taylor described a growing sense of alarm at learning that $ 391 million in military aid for Ukraine had been held up. He also said he had discovered that Mr. Trump was conditioning "everything" about the United States' relationship with Ukraine -- including a White House meeting for Ukraine's president -- on the country's willingness to commit publicly to investigations of his political rivals.
In a July 25 telephone call, Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate two politically charged allegations: one was a widely debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian involvement in 2016 election tampering and the other was related to corruption at an energy company that employed the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that the Bidens were involved in wrongdoing.
Mr. Taylor, a longtime diplomat, was asked to come out of retirement after the United States ambassador to Kyiv, Marie L. Yovanovitch, was ousted for resisting a shadow foreign policy campaign in Ukraine that was run by Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.
But after Mr. Taylor was pulled into what he called an "irregular channel" of diplomatic relations between Washington and Kyiv, he became one of the most senior State Department officials to openly challenge it.
Withholding the security aid as threatened would be "crazy," Mr. Taylor wrote on Sept. 9 in a text to Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Taylor also threatened to quit if Ukrainian officials committed to an investigation of Mr. Trump's rivals and still did not receive the $ 391 million in aid -- what Mr. Taylor called a "nightmare" situation.
He was recalled to the State Department from a position helping lead the United States Institute of Peace after nearly five decades of government work -- including a tour in Vietnam as an Army infantry soldier, a stint as a Senate staff member and diplomatic postings including Brussels, Baghdad and Kabul, Afghanistan.
But he was expected to serve in Kyiv only temporarily.
Names already are being rumored for Mr. Taylor's replacement, including retired Lt. Gen. Keith W. Dayton, according to a person familiar with the issue. Mr. Dayton currently is the director of the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, in Germany, but was appointed in 2018 as the senior United States defense adviser to Ukraine, according to his biography.
Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.

Eviction Crises That a Few Hundred Dollars Could Solve

Texto completo: Can Washington do something to help them? A growing number of politicians think so.
Among the millions of recent eviction cases researchers have begun to compile across the country, there are a startling number of modest sums. There are dozens of families in Texas evicted with money judgments -- unpaid rent, late fees, court costs -- totaling $ 516. There are multiple families in Cumberland County, N.C., who owed all of $ 301. There is a household in Providence, R.I., whose 2016 court record shows a debt of just $ 127.
Such relatively small sums suggest that, for all of the intractable problems of poverty and affordable housing driving the nation's eviction crisis, a little intervention could help many people. And politicians in Washington increasingly have such ideas in mind: court translators, more legal aid, mediation -- even emergency rent assistance.
One bill, introduced in the Senate on Thursday by a Democrat, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and a Republican, Rob Portman of Ohio, would create a federal grant program to fund local emergency aid for tenants at risk of eviction. The bill, which would also establish a national database tracking eviction cases, is the latest in a series of federal proposals aimed at a problem that touches high-cost coastal cities and smaller towns alike.
Several Democratic senators -- Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland -- introduced a bill this fall that would create federal grants for landlord-tenant mediation programs and translators. In the House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has introduced a bill that would fund legal aid in states and cities that establish a right to counsel for tenants that is akin to a new mandate in New York City.
And in the Democratic primary, an anti-eviction agenda is now practically a required element of candidates' housing plans. Bernie Sanders supports a national "just cause" standard, limiting the grounds on which a landlord can evict a tenant. Cory Booker wants to prevent consumer reporting agencies from listing eviction cases won by the tenant. Amy Klobuchar wants to create new kinds of savings accounts that renters could tap in an emergency.
Such strategies most likely would not address the structural problems of sluggish wage growth and a scarcity of low-cost housing that underlie the eviction crisis. But they imply that even if eviction is a necessary remedy for landlords, perhaps there could be less of it.
"Sometimes you hear this response from property owners who say, 'What do I do if a tenant is behind five, six, seven months?' And that's a really important question," said Matthew Desmond, a sociologist at Princeton whose eviction research has influenced politicians. In data his Eviction Lab has analyzed from 22 states, that situation of tenants deep in debt is rare. It's far more common, the lab has found, that tenants owe the equivalent of less than a month's rent.
"That suggests a shallower end of the risk pool that you could lop off," Mr. Desmond said.
Failure to pay rent is by far the most common cause of eviction. Across the 22 states where the Eviction Lab has data covering at least some counties, the median money judgment for cases between 2014 and 2016 was $ 1,253. Because that total includes other costs accumulated during the court process, most tenants initially faced eviction for the failure to pay a smaller rent sum (which is often not documented in eviction records).
Nearly half of the money judgments the lab has analyzed in Virginia were for less than the median rent in the census tract where the eviction occurred. In North Carolina, that's true in more than 40 percent of cases. Across the 22 states, about a third of money judgments were for less than the local median rent.
"That third of the people that can't come up with a month's rent, finding a way to stabilize their housing situation will actually be less costly than the remedy of throwing them out in to the street -- for everybody," said Mr. Bennet, who is also running for president. "Today, the externalities of that third of people are invisible to society."
The public doesn't see the cost of homeless shelters, or the cost to landlords of having to find new tenants, or the costs when newly homeless children change schools and classrooms are disrupted, said Mr. Bennet, who was previously the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools.
Many of these proposals are effectively trying to slow down the eviction process, or to create more alternatives to it.
"The court system has been set up so that the choice for the landlord is really eviction or nothing," Ms. Hassan said.
Her bill would also charge the Department of Housing and Urban Development with studying insurance models that landlords or tenants could buy into to guard against the possibility of a missed rent payment.
"Most families in poverty that are renting are spending half their income on rent, with no margin for error," said Mike Koprowski, who leads a network of advocacy groups through the National Low-Income Housing Coalition that has pushed for emergency assistance grants. "There's no margin for the broken-down car, the unreimbursed medical bill, the hours cut at your job."
Landlord associations respond that such precariousness is the real problem. Wages have stagnated for the poor, and the supply of housing affordable to the poorest renters has dwindled. Between 1990 and 2017, the national stock of rental housing grew by 10.9 million units, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Over that same time, the number of units renting for less than $ 600 a month in inflation-adjusted dollars fell by 4 million. All net growth in rental housing in America, in other words, has been for higher-income tenants.
"We regard evictions generally as a symptom of a larger problem that we have, which is a lack of housing that's affordable," said Greg Brown, the senior vice president of government affairs for the National Apartment Association. "The question we have to ask ourselves is, do changes in the process address that core issue, or do they lengthen a process of eviction and really end up in the same place?"
One recent study linking eviction records in Cook County, Ill., with credit report and payday loans data suggests that policy interventions to the court process itself may be too late to help many poor families. The study found that in the years leading up to an eviction filing, tenants who would ultimately wind up in court had mounting and substantially higher debts, compared with random tenants in the same neighborhoods.
"The signs of that disruption and financial distress appear two to four years ahead of the eviction filings," said Winnie van Dijk, one of the study's authors. For policymakers who want to help these families, she said, "it's not as simple as avoiding a court order for eviction, unfortunately."
The Bennet-Portman bill envisions some outcomes where a tenant might lose housing they can't afford but still land in a better place. The bill would also create a grant program to support community courts that might, for instance, be tied directly to local providers of social services. The Cleveland Municipal Housing Court currently operates a similar model, where the most vulnerable tenants facing eviction are flagged for social services. In 2018, about 17 percent of eviction cases that came before the court were referred to case workers who tried to find programs like mental health support and homeless services for tenants.
Sherrae Landrum, 74, was summoned to the Cleveland court last December for accumulating clutter that her landlord objected to. She ultimately lost her home, but a social worker the court connected her to helped her find a temporary homeless shelter and then a permanent home. The social worker drove her to doctor's appointments and accompanied her to pay the deposit on her new apartment. She helped enroll Ms. Landrum in a home health aide service, a meal-delivery program, and a class to manage hoarding tendencies.
Eviction court can present, at least, an opportunity to connect tenants with agencies that might help halt cycles of poverty, said Casey Albitz, who runs the court's social service referral program.
"It was a blessing," Ms. Landrum said of her case. She has more resources and support now than she ever did before. "They did me a favor."

Texto completo: Inside Horcher, a fine-dining restaurant in Madrid, the tuxedoed servers and the cushions they place beneath diners' feet appear straight out of late-1930s German high society. The opulence is sufficient to let patrons of the original Horcher, open from 1904 to 1943 in Berlin, focus not on Hitler's rise or subsequent war, but on evening gowns and champagne bubbles.
In February 1943, after a brutal defeat in Stalingrad, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels delivered his 'Total War' speech, calling on all citizens to commit to the war effort and announcing the shuttering of many Berlin restaurants: 'It may be that an occasional person thinks that, even during war, his stomach is the most important thing. We cannot pay him any heed.'
He might have meant Hermann Göring.
As hedonistic as he was savage, Göring, the Air Force's commander in chief, kept pet lions and loved haute cuisine, fine wine and bling. Horcher was his favorite restaurant. A fighter pilot hailed as a hero after World War I, he was welcomed at Horcher free of charge. 'They scratched each other's backs,' says historian Giles MacDonogh. 'Horcher fed Göring, and in turn, whenever Göring had to entertain, he hired Horcher to cater or took his guests to the restaurant.' When the paramilitary smashed Horcher's windows, Göring helped move the restaurant to Madrid. According to Uki Goñi's book 'The Real Odessa,' the Madrid Horcher, too, became a Nazi hangout. There, Nazis hiding in Spain planned the 'ratlines,' their escapes from Europe into Latin America.
For 115 years, Horcher has maintained its reputation for feeding the elite. It's still in the family: Owner Elisabeth Horcher (who initially agreed to be interviewed for this story but stopped responding to follow-up questions) is the fourth generation. 'There is no other restaurant in the history of the twentieth " or indeed any " century,' MacDonogh wrote in Gastronomica, 'that has relocated from one European capital to another without losing a jot of its social exclusivity.'


We start with vichyssoise , decidedly French (though Julia Child claimed it as American) but certainly not un-German (potatoes!), and move on to kartoffelpuffer, or what we Hanukkah celebrants call latkes, alongside fermented herring in cream sauce. Horcher's renown rose during World War I because the restaurant served game meat from the Black Forest, food that wasn't rationed in wartime Germany. Game remains on the menu, though Göring's favorite dish, Viennese chicken, is gone. Göring was known to sample other offerings, too: After the Night of the Long Knives, a 1934 massacre that consolidated Hitler's power, Göring, Holocaust-architect-to-be Heinrich Himmler and other celebratory Nazis headed to Horcher and feasted on crab.
I order crab deep-fried in its shell and served with spicy sauces. My dining companion loves her stroganoff, the brown sauce tart and creamy, the spaetzle just right.

The labels 'Nazi' and 'fascist' should be used prudently, but it's tough to ignore the hiccup of historical repetition. In many European countries, the far right is ascending. The Holocaust began long before Kristallnacht and Auschwitz, with ostracism, dehumanization and deportations, which are happening the world over, the United States included.
Spain has its own far right. Launched in late 2013, the Vox party campaigns from an ethnocentric platform and has proposed building a wall to keep out Moroccans. One of their slogans? 'Make Spain Great Again.' In April, Vox won 24 seats in Congress, but soon after, many predicted that its star was dimming. In July, Paloma Cervilla, a journalist for Madrid's politically conservative ABC, told me, 'Spain is not the U.S.' She was referring to a Spanish aversion to extreme politics. Jingoism reminds them of dictator Francisco Franco, who ruled from 1939 until his death in 1975. But her prediction may have been premature: November's election elevated Vox to the third-largest party in parliament.

Shortly after April's election, Cervilla's friend called her from Horcher with gossip: At one table, Mariano Rajoy " former leader of Spain's conservative party, Partido Popular, ousted for his role in a corruption scandal " was dining with friends, near a table full of members of Vox, the party that capitalized on Rajoy's demise. That's Horcher: a seat for everyone, a list that through the decades has included not just the political class but also Salvador Dalí, Sophia Loren and Ernest Hemingway.
Like its revisionist history-chic decor, Horcher's open-arms policy is as charming as it is discomfiting. Though restaurateurs aren't obligated to police their customers' decency, egalitarian treatment becomes ethically murky against politically perilous backdrops. Sure, let those Vox folks eat in peace, but where should a line be drawn? At drunk, disruptive customers? At legislators of racist policies? At Nazis? These aren't questions with simple answers, but the topic grows increasingly relevant. 'There are moments in time when people need to live their convictions,' the owner of the Virginia restaurant Red Hen told The Washington Post last summer. She had just eighty-sixed then-press secretary Sarah Sanders, disseminator of Trump's anti-democracy rhetoric that the press is the 'enemy of the people.'
In late 1930s and early 1940s Europe, though few knew the extent of Hitler's atrocities, the atmosphere of hate was palpable. Germans most certainly did know that Jews were living in fear, weathering violence, disappearing. They heard the Nazis' cries that Jews were a threat to national security, to the aesthetics of Germany and to the world.
In an interview last year with the Spanish publication El Confidencial, Elisabeth Horcher addressed her restaurant's history, calling her grandparents 'survivors,' a word that, when used in reference to World War II, is usually reserved for Jewish prisoners who were miraculously alive when the camps were liberated. 'I feel proud of my great-grandparents and my grandparents, who set up the restaurant. They were survivors. They had to live through a very convulsive time. They had to leave their country.' She added that 'both Germans and English' dined at Horcher. 'My grandparents were not supporters of the regime.'


Every October of my childhood , my family drove from the Boston suburbs to Salem. Though it's home to a museum dedicated to the 17th-century witch trials, Salem in autumn is a Halloween destination with a haunted house and a 'Haunted Happenings Harbor Cruise,' as though its legacy is a cartoon witch in a pointy hat riding a broom, rather than the executions of innocent women. That's history made palatable. It's cringeworthy whitewashing.
Horcher is a time capsule, from the framed photos of celebrity diners (minus, you know, Göring and Himmler) to the miniature men on horses encased behind glass, but it's a time capsule that makes no mention of the suffering of Jews, as if World War II-era Berlin merits nostalgia. When I mention this to MacDonogh, a descendant of Jews who were sent to concentration camps, he asks me what I'm proposing, a Third Reich museum in one of Madrid's fanciest restaurants? 'That wouldn't be conducive to appetite,' he points out. He also notes that many businesses are more complicit than Horcher. Plenty of restaurants fed Nazis. And Hugo Boss, for example, produced the SS uniforms.
But isn't there a resting place between Third Reich Museum and erasure? Perhaps photos on Horcher's walls of Nazi-resistance figures? Acknowledgment of the family's opportunism in lieu of a tale of 'survival'?
Or maybe my visceral reaction to Horcher is a product of the moment we're living in. Nostalgia has been politically weaponized to the point of vulgarity in both the United States and Spain: Making any country that has progressed toward diversity and equality 'great again' necessitates willful ignorance of the past, idealization of ethnic purity, a greenlighting of abuse toward certain swaths of society.

For dessert , we enjoy what our waiter calls the 'star' of Horcher: baumkuchen, German for 'tree cake' because its layers resemble tree rings. The cake stands tall on its own table outside the kitchen for guests to admire. The metaphor is glaring: Though rings may prove a tree is old, they don't reveal its whole story.

Ross Douthat: Laughing through the Trump Era

Texto completo: An essential motion picture for the Trump era is one that I didn’t particularly care for when it first came out. I speak, of course, of “Burn After Reading,” the Coen brothers’ pitch-black comedy about morons attempting spycraft in Washington, D.C., which upon first viewing seemed too unremittingly misanthropic, too grimly contemptuous of its characters, without the flashes of grace that illuminate the darkness in most Coen depictions of human folly.
That was in 2008; how young and naïve I was back then. Just over a decade later, the Coens’ portrait of grasping fools and self-important Beltway nitwits trying to behave like characters in a John le Carré novel seems less like misanthropy and more like prophecy — a vision of amoral political buffoonery that’s arguably the most realistic depiction of Trumpiness to date.
I am not the first to point this out: Jeet Heer of The New Republic has been a frequent “Burn After Reading” booster, and he devoted a short essay to the movie in 2017, comparing the attempts of its chucklehead antiheroes, Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) to sell what they think are state secrets to the Russians to the blundering, “if it’s what you say I love it” way that Donald Trump Jr. and his cronies tried to hook up with Russian dirt-peddlers in 2016.
But Heer’s take needs updating now that we have the inspector general’s damning report on the credulous, overreaching FBI investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties — a report that rounds out the Russiagate narrative by revealing the breadth of farce involved.
If you imagine “L’Affaire Russe” as a movie pitch, it would promise to tell three intertwining stories. In the first thread, Russian hackers use the simplest of phishing techniques against clueless Democratic muckety-mucks to tap into a bunch of Democratic Party emails, exposing not state secrets but a bunch of squalid intraparty backbiting.
In the second thread, the dolts and self-promoters surrounding a buffoonish presidential candidate try to make contact with the Russians, something the Russians don’t particularly want and the dolts are too doltish to accomplish — leading to absurdist scenes like the famous Trump Tower meeting, where Don Jr. shows up expecting a big intel deal and instead gets a lecture on Russian adoptions while Jared Kushner tunes out and checks his phone.
This comedy of hapless would-be dirty tricksters then weaves into the third thread, the one the inspector general report has unspooled for us: In this part of the movie, the law-enforcement agents watching the Russian hacking unfold become convinced — with an assist from a top-secret dossier compiled by a handsome ex-spook who used to pal around with the buffoonish candidate’s daughter — that they’re investigating a vast, world-shaking conspiracy, complete with Russian intelligence assets in the Trump campaign and secret Prague meetings to set the agenda for a Manchurian candidacy. And then their investigation, which focuses on a couple of random, comic Trumpworld figures and comes up empty, gets taken up by a credulous media, which spins a narrative of noble G-men and legal eagles who are supposedly about to reveal Putin’s baroque, dating-to-the-1980s conspiracy to install a puppet in the White House, knock out our power grid and probably poison our precious bodily fluids as well.
To borrow from Oscar Wilde, it would take a heart of stone to contemplate this tale without some laughter — enough to easily justify casting comic actors in all the different parts. (I’m thinking Will Arnett doing the full Gob Bluth as Don Jr., George Clooney playing Christopher Steele in full handsome-bungler mode, Vince Vaughn looming as Jim Comey, Kate McKinnon radiating paranoid intensity as Rachel Maddow, Bill Murray as a nearly-comatose Robert Mueller and — post-prison — Roger Stone and Anthony Weiner as themselves.)
Of course the stone-hearted will object that we shouldn’t laugh so long as the punch line is still that Donald Trump is president. Sure, at some point we might be able to look back and find mordant comedy in an arc like Comey’s — who sabotaged Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign by announcing a last-minute investigation of the infamous Weiner laptop and then remade himself as a self-righteous icon of the Resistance by legitimizing “pee tape” rumors. But the time for laughter is later, once Trump is gone, the shadow of corruption lifted and all the vulnerable and marginal people victimized by this administration can breathe safely once again.
I have two answers to this case against laughter.
The first is a rejection of its final premise: Trump has indeed hurt vulnerable people, but between the leaven of incompetence in his cruelty, his rejection of some of the disastrous ambitions of his predecessors and a certain amount of fool’s luck, his administration is arguably responsible for fewer human tragedies so far than more high-minded, less personally degraded presidencies.
And I don’t just mean to reference George W. Bush and the Iraq War here. To return to the subject of my last column, in President Barack Obama’s first few years in office about 1,500 U.S. soldiers and thousands more Afghans died for a futile and dishonestly justified campaign. If laughter was permissible while that deadly folly was transpiring (mostly out of the public eye), it’s probably OK to laugh at our situation now.
The second answer, meanwhile, is a mild suggestion that a little more laughter might actually be good for the anti-Trump Resistance. In particular, anti-Trumpists might be a touch more effective if they could recognize how humorlessness and constant self-important dudgeon frequently helps the Trumpian cause, by setting up the dynamic I just sketched in my movie pitch — where the country is asked to choose between two kinds of folly, one squalid and corrupt but the other pompous, insufferable and paranoid in its own self-important way.
The latter sort of folly is at its worst, not on the far left, but on the establishment center-left and the Never-Trumper center-right, to which I belonged in 2016 and still do, in the sense that I continue to regard our president as unfit for his job and undeserving of a second term. But that belief, it seems to me, should coexist with some self-awareness about the many blunders by the great and good that brought us to this pass, some instinct for how absurd it sounds to write and talk as if the republic dies daily only to be resurrected overnight and slain by Trump anew, and some recognition that when our law enforcement agencies send their G-men to save the Republic from Vladimir Putin, sometimes they don’t send their best.
Or to bring things to a finer point: If you couldn’t see, long before the Mueller report fizzle or the latest revelations of FBI incompetence, that Comey was a fundamentally comical figure rather than a paragon of old-school American virtue, then you have no business leading a resistance movement against a president whose main political talent is to make his rivals look ridiculous.
At the end of “Burn After Reading,” the pompous, alcoholic CIA-agent character Ozzie Cox, played with urbane self-delusion by John Malkovich, confronts one of the civilians he believes has tormented and blackmailed him. “You represent the idiocy of today,” he says. “You’re part of a league of morons .”
That Malkovich’s character is himself an idiot, that “League of Morons” could be an alternate title for the entire Coen farce, is obvious to any viewer. And at this point, the reality that many would-be saviors of the Trump-era republic bear an unfortunate resemblance to Ozzie Cox should be obvious to our own black comedy’s audience as well.

Texto completo: A wintry mix of precipitation throughout the Midwest that has led to deadly weather-related crashes is expected to continue into Tuesday, but the Pittsburgh region faces only a threat of minor flooding this week.
At least nine people have died in weather-related crashes in several Midwestern states amid a storm that dumped nearly a foot of snow in places, forced schools to close and snarled traffic, authorities said. The weather was part of a storm system that was expected to extend into the Northeast through Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.
A large stretch of the country, from Colorado to the Northeast, would probably see 1 to 2 inches of snow through Tuesday, said Patrick Burke, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.
Locally, a 12-county area of Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia already is under a flood advisory - from Allegheny County south - due to as much as three-quarters of an inch of snow and rain that fell through Monday, with another 1 to 1½ inches forecast overnight into Tuesday, said Myranda Fullerton, a weather service meteorologist in Moon.
The level of the Ohio River near the Mon Wharf in Downtown could reach 1½ feet above the flood stage of 18 feet sometime between Tuesday evening and Thursday morning, the weather service said.
As a precaution, parking along the lower planter wall of the wharf will be prohibited Tuesday. Vehicles should be removed by 7 p.m. as river levels rise, the weather service stated.
The flood advisory includes Allegheny, Fayette, Greene, Washington and Westmoreland counties in Pennsylvania, along with Preston, Tucker, Marion, Marshall, Monongalia and Wetzel counties in West Virginia and Garrett County in Maryland.
A flood watch also was issued Monday for Elizabeth and Charleroi, in Washington County, both situated along the Monongahela River.
In Missouri, the storm dumped 3 to 9 inches of snow across much of the state, which was under either a winter weather advisory or winter storm warning Monday.
The Missouri State Highway Patrol said three people were killed Sunday night when a driver lost control and overturned on Route 67 in St. Francois County in the eastern part of the state. A motorist who was stranded after a previous crash and two good Samaritans who were trying to help were struck.
And in mid-Missouri's Callaway County, an 18-year-old was killed when his vehicle went off the side of a highway and overturned.
The patrol also said in a tweet Sunday night that it had responded to 525 calls from stranded motorists and to nearly 560 other traffic crashes.
In Nebraska, a crash Sunday on Interstate 80 northeast of Lincoln left three passengers, ages 10, 15 and 19, dead. The crash occurred when the driver of an eastbound SUV lost control amid slick conditions, struck another eastbound vehicle before veering into the median, rolling and entering the westbound lanes. The SUV was then hit by a car and a pickup truck, according to the Nebraska State Patrol.
In Kansas, the storm brought up to 11 inches of snow. The Kansas Department of Transportation said multiple roads were partially or completely snow-covered. A 21-year-old man died Sunday when a pickup truck in which he was riding overturned on an icy Wichita road.
Weather was also believed to have been a factor in a collision Monday between an SUV and a pickup truck that killed a woman and her son along a road east of Indianapolis, police said. Fifty-four-year-old Amy Cox and her 24-year-old son, Isaac Cox, of New Palestine, Ind., were pronounced dead at the scene.
At St. Louis Lambert International Airport, about 20 departing flights and 20 arriving flights were canceled Monday morning due to the storm. The storm also closed the University of Missouri and Emporia State University in Kansas.
In the the Tri-State Area, scattered snow showers are expected through Wednesday with no significant accumulation, with cloudy skies late in the week, Ms. Fullerton said, noting only a slim chance of a white Christmas next week

Texto completo: Donald Trump is considering skipping the 2020 presidential debates, according to a New York Times report Thursday, throwing into question Belmont University's starring role as host of the final debate.
Trump has reportedly discussed avoiding the televised matches because of his distrust of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the group that organizes the events.
The Times, citing anonymous sources, said Trump is more concerned about who the debate moderator would be than who he would be debating from the Democratic field of candidates.
In October the commission named Belmont as the winning finalist to host the third presidential debate on Oct. 22, 2020.
At the time, Belmont President Bob Fisher called the campus's 2008 presidential debate a "transformational moment" for the university that "changed the way we thought about ourselves."
A representative from Belmont on Friday referred questions to the commission.
"It's just too early to tell," commission co-chair Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr. said in an interview Friday.
He pointed out that President Jimmy Carter declined to attend one debate in 1980.
"There is no guarantee," he said. "There is no way you can force a president. ... We're going forward with our planning."

Texto completo: "Children of Virtue and Vengeance" (Henry Holt and Co., 416 pp., ) is the highly anticipated sequel to "Children of Blood and Bone," the first book of Tomi Adeyemi's West African-inspired fantasy trilogy, Legacy of Orïsha. Famously, "Children of Blood and Bone" netted the now-26-year-old Adeyemi a seven-figure advance, one of the biggest in the history of young adult fiction. Quickly after that, Fox 2000 picked up the film rights. As of now, "Children of Blood and Bone" has been on The New York Times best-seller list for more than 34 weeks, and has spent 20 weeks on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.
The dynamics of power, corruption and identity are further explored in "Virtue and Vengeance." Where "Blood and Bone" explores how persecuted minorities find ways to retain their culture, "Virtue and Vengeance" places that minority on an equal playing field with their oppressors overnight. The characters are forced to rethink what they know about their culture and exactly who gets to own it.
The first book follows Zélie, her brother Tzain and runaway princess Amari in a quest to return magic to the land of Orïsha, where the maji people who formerly had powers are being ruthlessly persecuted by the monarchy. The monarchy chases the trio as well as Amari's brother, Prince Inan, who also discovers he has powers and a special bound to Zélie. Unlike Zélie, Inan sees his magic as curse rather than a blessing, especially under the rule of his father, who sees the maji only as "maggots."
At the end of "Blood and Bone," Zeilie, Tzain and Amari return magic to the lands of Orïsha, and the once-powerless majis now have the magic they had lost, and with it a desire to reclaim their culture that had nearly been wiped out.
Yet, the majis are not the only ones who wake up with powers. The ruling class also discover they have new powers and even more reason to wipe out the majis for good. And that includes the genocidal queen of Orïsha, Nehanda, who now takes her husband's place on the throne after he is killed by his daughter Amari at the end of "Blood and Bone."
Peace has never been more fragile. The book grapples with the idea of compromise when unspeakable violence has been committed against a group of people who are now returning such violence with a vengeance. The central conflict of the story is the war between the monarchy and the newly empowered maji, but the discord starts in the intimate bonds among the main characters, with characters' actions rippling out from the personal to acts of war.
Adeyemi expands on the strengths of the first book and raises the stakes in both friendships and in war, challenging the loyalties that were strongly cemented in "Blood and Bone." (though some relationships, especially the romances, feel underdeveloped and rushed). "Virtue and Vengeance" also introduces characters and revives old ones, revealing more difficult questions about redemption, power and reparations. Adeyemi does not pull any punches relating the horrors of genocide and war, yet her books still maintain a spirit of fantasy and adventure without her message losing its impact.
It builds to an ending that leaves the reader with a feeling that can only be described as dread. The dread is not a negative point, but adds scope to the series and more complexity to the theme of identity. Adeyemi writes a mean cliffhanger and successfully upends expectations.
The last chapter will undoubtedly leave fans shaking with questions until the final installment of the trilogy is published.

THE YEAR IN PICTURES
An article on Page 4 about a New York Times project to photograph the record number of women in the 116th Congress misstates how many participated. Most female representatives and senators took part, not all of them.
TRAVEL
The Check In article on Dec. 1, about several standout ski resorts, referred incorrectly to the location of Whistler, British Columbia. It is in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, not in the Canadian Rockies.
BOOK REVIEW
The Shortlist feature on Dec. 1 misstated the surname of the author of "Leonardo da Vinci: The 100 Milestones" and "Leonardo by Leonardo" in several instances. He is Martin Kemp, not Kent.

State District Court makes decision on 'New Mexican' suit

Texto completo: A state District judge has dismissed a countersuit filed by The Santa Fe New Mexican against the Public Service Company of New Mexico, the state Public Regulation Commission and BHP Billiton New Mexico Coal after they sought in 2015 to keep the newspaper from publishing documents they said were confidential.
In its countersuit, The New Mexican contended it had the right to publish documents involving PNMs plans at the time for the San Juan Generating Station in the Four Corners area. The newspaper received the documents through a public records request that asked for all emails between PNM and the Public Regulation Commission, which oversees utilities in the state. The documents were included as attachments in those emails.
The commission filed a request for a temporary restraining order against the newspaper and days later was joined by PNM and two coal companies, one of which has since gone bankrupt. The New Mexican published the documents on its website.
The companies that intervened in the suit tried to withdraw and the regulatory commission eventually reached a settlement in which the commission agreed to pay The New Mexican $20,000 and agree to never again try to impose a publication restraint.
However, the newspaper in a countersuit had asked the judge to dismiss the case with prejudice, which would mean the claims could never be filed again. The countersuit also claimed the companies had tried to stop publication of the documents in violation of the state Inspection of Public Records Act and the First Amendment and asked the court to award damages, attorneys fees and expenses.
Judge Francis Mathew, who took over the case when Judge David Thomson was appointed to the state Supreme Court, dismissed the newspapers countersuit in a decision handed down earlier this month.
In the ruling, Mathew agreed with arguments that governments must meet a high threshold for trying to prevent a paper from publishing, citing a landmark 1970 case involving the New York Times. But in granting a motion for judgment based on the pleadings in the case, Mathew said the companies had an established right to petition the government by suing the newspaper in court, and The New Mexican did not meet criteria to show it was an objectively baseless lawsuit.

Teamwork, Patience and Strong Support From Outside Funders Made This Report on Child Abuse Possible

Texto completo: ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.
Sometimes the old expression “it takes a village” applies very much to investigative journalism.
Today’s report on America’s stalled war against child abuse required the combined efforts of not only The Boston Globe and ProPublica, but also financial support from four outside funders, including Participant, a producer of the Academy Award-winning movie “Spotlight.”
And none of it would have happened if not for the relentless efforts of two Spotlight Fellows and a crew of interns who didn’t give up during the more than two and a half years they needed to collect extensive information about child abuse from all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
Emily Palmer, who writes about courts and crime for The New York Times, and Jessica Huseman, who writes about elections at ProPublica, were selected to be Spotlight Investigative Journalism Fellows in May of 2017 on the strength of their proposal to prove that virtually every state was violating the nation’s primary law against child abuse. The judges were impressed with their ambition as well as the importance of the topic.
After all, Participant, founded by Jeff Skoll and dedicated to entertainment that inspires social change, created the Spotlight Fellowship in 2016 as a way to champion tough investigative reporting in the wake of the enormous success of its film “Spotlight.”
But the fellowship was designed to provide funds for a one-year investigation, and Palmer and Huseman’s task proved much taller than they initially expected as many states were reluctant to provide details, especially about children who died from abuse. So the investigation continued into a second and then a third year.
Along the way, three other organizations provided financial support to the project, starting with the Massachusetts-based Freelance Investigative Reporters and Editors, or FIRE, which provided initial funding. Later, The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism at Columbia University as well as Investigative Reporters and Editors, a professional organization, provided funding as well. (No funding went to Huseman, a full-time staff member at ProPublica, or to ProPublica itself.)
Through it all, Palmer and Huseman just kept going.
In the end, working with interns from Columbia Journalism School, Palmer and Huseman were able to demonstrate that not a single state follows every major provision of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act — but the federal government has taken virtually no enforcement action. The reporters also showed that the federal government simply does not know how many children die each year from abuse and neglect.
Their report is in the spirit of The Boston Globe Spotlight Team’s history of long-term investigations, including Spotlight’s investigation of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, the topic of the 2016 movie. And it certainly makes us all appreciate why investigative reporters need a team behind them.

Trump’s issue is less with the potential Democratic nominee and more about the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit organization that sponsors the debates, according to the New York Times.
Trump told his advisers he does not trust the commission and worries about the media personality who will be chosen to moderate the debate.
The president repeatedly complained about the debates in the 2016 general election, which gave Hillary Clinton a bump in the polls after each of their matchups.
After his debate performance in September 2016 was criticized, Trump blamed a “defective mic” and questioned whether it was done “on purpose” to boost Clinton. The commission acknowledged that a technical malfunction had affected the volume of his mic during the debate.
His debate team also clashed with the commission over a group of women who accused President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or sexual harassment. The Trump campaign invited the women to the second debate and wanted them seated in the V.I.P. box, where the former president would have to walk past them. The commission threatened to have the women removed if they sat in Trump’s box.

Texto completo: The most terrifying aspect of the U.S. political drama isn’t the revelation that the president has abused his power for personal gain. If you didn’t see that coming from the day Donald Trump was elected, you weren’t paying attention.
No, the real revelation has been the utter depravity of the Republican Party. Essentially every elected or appointed official in that party has chosen to defend Trump by buying into crazy, debunked conspiracy theories. That is, one of America’s two major parties is beyond redemption; given that, it’s hard to see how democracy can long endure, even if Trump is defeated.
However, the scariest reporting I’ve seen recently has been about science, not politics. A new federal report finds that climate change in the Arctic is accelerating, matching what used to be considered worst-case scenarios. And there are indications that Arctic warming may be turning into a self-reinforcing spiral, as the thawing tundra itself releases vast quantities of greenhouse gases.
Catastrophic sea-level rise, heat waves that make major population centers uninhabitable and more are now looking more likely than not, and sooner rather than later.
But the terrifying political news and the terrifying climate news are closely related.
Why, after all, has the world failed to take action on climate, and why is it still failing to act even as the danger gets ever more obvious? There are, of course, many culprits; action was never going to be easy.
But one factor stands out above all others: the fanatical opposition of America’s Republicans, who are the world’s only major climate-denialist party. Because of this opposition, the United States hasn’t just failed to provide the kind of leadership that would have been essential to global action, it has become a force against action.
And Republican climate denial is rooted in the same kind of depravity that we’re seeing with regard to Trump.
As I’ve written in the past, climate denial was in many ways the crucible for Trumpism. Long before the cries of “fake news,” Republicans were refusing to accept science that contradicted their prejudices. Long before Republicans began attributing every negative development to the machinations of the “deep state,” they were insisting that global warming was a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast global cabal of corrupt scientists.
And long before Trump began weaponizing the power of the presidency for political gain, Republicans were using their political power to harass climate scientists and, where possible, criminalize the practice of science itself.
Perhaps not surprisingly, some of those responsible for these abuses are now ensconced in the Trump administration. Notably, Ken Cuccinelli, who as attorney general of Virginia engaged in a long witch-hunt against climate scientist Michael Mann, is now at the Department of Homeland Security, where he pushes anti-immigrant policies with, as The Times reports, “little concern for legal restraints.”
But why have Republicans become the party of climate doom? Money is an important part of the answer: In the current cycle Republicans have received 97% of political contributions from the coal industry, 88% from oil and gas. And this doesn’t even count the wing-nut welfare offered by institutions supported by the Koch brothers and other fossil-fuel moguls.
However, I don’t believe that it’s just about the money. My sense is that right-wingers believe, probably correctly, that there’s a sort of halo effect surrounding any form of public action. Once you accept that we need policies to protect the environment, you’re more likely to accept the idea that we should have policies to ensure access to health care, child care and more. So the government must be prevented from doing anything good, lest it legitimize a broader progressive agenda.
Still, whatever the short-term political incentives, it takes a special kind of depravity to respond to those incentives by denying facts, embracing insane conspiracy theories and putting the very future of civilization at risk.
Unfortunately, that kind of depravity isn’t just present in the modern Republican Party, it has effectively taken over the whole institution. There used to be at least some Republicans with principles; as recently as 2008, Sen. John McCain co-sponsored serious climate-change legislation. But those people have either experienced total moral collapse (hello, Sen. Graham) or left the party.
The truth is that even now I don’t fully understand how things got this bad. But the reality is clear: Modern Republicans are irredeemable, devoid of principle or shame. And there is, as I said, no reason to believe that this will change even if Trump is defeated next year.
The only way that either American democracy or a livable planet can survive is if the Republican Party as it now exists is effectively dismantled and replaced with something better — maybe with a party that has the same name but completely different values. This may sound like an impossible dream. But it’s the only hope we have.

Texto completo: Douglas Miguel Rodríguez, trabajador inmigrante de Guayaquil (Ecuador) que murió en la masacre del martes en un supermercado judío en Jersey City, ha sido proclamado un “héroe” porque aún herido ayudó a una persona a escapar por la puerta trasera del establecimiento.
La Fiscalía de Nueva Jersey confirmó ayer que el tiroteo que culminó con la muerte de seis personas -4 víctimas y 2 novios pistoleros fanáticos religiosos- se investiga como “potencial acto de terrorismo doméstico”, alimentado por el antisemitismo y el odio a los agentes del orden.
Anoche se realizó una vigilia emocional en Jersey City. Parientes, amigos y completos extraños se unieron en memoria de las cuatro vidas inocentes que se perdieron en un instante, reseñó CBS2.
El rabino David Niederman dijo que Rodríguez murió como un héroe. “Después de recibir un disparo, abrió la puerta trasera para que rescataran a un cliente”, dijo a la prensa. “Desafortunadamente, murió al pisar esa puerta”.
Su esposa contuvo las lágrimas mientras agradecía al mercado que empleaba a su esposo por aceptarlo. “La comunidad judía aprendió a amar a mi esposo y estuvo allí para él y lo recibió”, dijo.
Otro doliente dijo que Rodríguez era como un hermano para él. “Lo amamos, lo extrañamos, pero sabemos que estará bien porque creía en Jesús”, dijo.
Su servicio conmemorativo se llevará a cabo de 5 a 9 p.m. mañana sábado en el Michigan Memorial en Paterson, Nueva Jersey.
Una página ha sido creada en GoFundMe en su memoria. Al momento se han donado allí más de $70 mil dólares para su esposa e hija. El Consulado de Ecuador también las está apoyando.
Rodríguez murió trabajando en “Jersey City Kosher Supermarket”, el único negocio kosher en la zona, informó The Fayetteville Observer.
También murieron la dueña del local, Leah Minda Ferencz (33), y su primo Moshe Hirsch Deutsh (24), miembros de la comunidad judía ortodoxa; el detective Joseph Seals (40), considerado un héroe local; y los atacantes, el hombre David Anderson (47) y la mujer Francine Graham (50), que se cree están vinculados al grupo religioso “Israelitas Negros” (Black Hebrew Israelites), según The New York Times.

Texto completo: A document seeking financing and partners for a new Club World Cup suggests FIFA may have designs on controlling a larger share of soccer's riches.
Make us an offer we can't refuse.
That is FIFA's message in a document sent to investors, commercial partners and media companies interested in teaming with soccer's world governing body on a new World Cup for clubs that starts in China in 2021.
The document, reviewed by The New York Times, offers potential partners the chance to propose their own vision for soccer, but it also offer clues that suggest FIFA's ambition is not merely to stage an expanded club championship every four years, but to become the global leader in club soccer. That kind of power shift would be significant, carrying with it huge implications for current competitions like the Champions League, but also for the influence of the continental governing bodies that have long managed the club game.
FIFA's tender offer says its objective is to find partners to create "the world's greatest club football experience," and it has told interested parties that they may suggest visions for future club tournaments that differ from the quadrennial club championship approved by FIFA's executive board earlier this year and awarded to China in October.
Offers "may include suggestions for alternative tournament parameters, including as to frequency, format, qualification process and team participation," FIFA said. Curiously, though, potential investors have been given only 11 business days to come up with a proposal to perhaps remake the model soccer has operated under for, in some cases, more than a century.
European soccer's governing body, UEFA, which organizes and profits from soccer's richest club competition, the Champions League, reluctantly agreed to FIFA's plans for an expanded Club World Cup after months of acrimony between its president, Aleksander Ceferin, and FIFA's, Gianni Infantino.
Any more substantial changes to the structure of club soccer are likely to be bitterly opposed by UEFA, which makes the bulk of its revenue -- as much as $ 1 billion a year -- from the Champions League.
Just last week, Ceferin reacted furiously after The Times reported that Infantino had met with Florentino Pérez, the president of Real Madrid, and discussed the details of a plan in which Europe's richest clubs would break off from UEFA to form their own independent competition. Such a move would see powerhouse clubs like Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and others abandon their domestic competitions.
Pérez, who as Real Madrid's president became a founding member of a new global association for international clubs when it was created last month at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, has floated similar breakaways in the past. But with Infantino's backing -- which remains uncertain -- his dream of a league in which powerful clubs write the rules and control the revenues could come closer to reality than ever before.
Pérez and Infantino declined to describe details of their discussions about the future of club soccer, but Ceferin rejected as "insane" any plan in which big clubs would leave their leagues and national associations.
"It would be hard to think of a more selfish and egotistical scheme," he said.
Until Infantino's arrival in 2016, FIFA had largely stayed in its lane when it came to club soccer, content with organizing and monetizing the World Cup, the multibillion-dollar tournament featuring national teams which is responsible for more than 90 percent of FIFA's revenue. Since becoming FIFA president, however, he has pushed harder and faster than any of his predecessors for world soccer's governing body to get a slice of the riches available in the club game.
Last year, he was forced to abandon a plan to close a $ 25 billion agreement with a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for two new events, including an expanded World Cup for clubs, after opposition from members of FIFA's board, led by Ceferin, and representative bodies for leagues and clubs.
That setback led FIFA to change its approach. It first sought approval for the quadrennial club world championship, and scrapped an idea for a national team league, before saying it would go to market with the event. But for the past months, it has held talks with CVC Capital Partners, the former majority owner of the Formula One racing series. CVC, one of the world's largest private-equity firms, also has significant investments in sports like rugby and motorcycle racing.
The Financial Times reported last week that the company has spoken with both FIFA and Real Madrid, and is interested in being a partner with FIFA for competitions and events beyond a single four-year tournament. A spokesman for CVC declined to comment.
Other companies have also expressed interest in the project, including Infront Sports & Media, a sports marketing company owned by the Dalian Wanda Group, one of FIFA's main sponsors. Officials there, and at least two other businesses interested in the tournament, expressed surprise that FIFA had not held preliminary discussions with them ahead of issuing its request for offers, but also at the short window to create a plan in time for the Dec. 19 deadline.
FIFA did not respond to an email for comment on the tender offer, or on its plans for a bigger role in club soccer.
Infantino has been open about his vision for club soccer to grow outside of its European stronghold. Earlier this month, he pushed the idea of investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a new Pan-African league, as a means to increase quality on the continent and slow the global talent drain to Europe. The FIFA president has also had talks with national associations in Asia about the possibility of creating regional or subregional leagues there, and conversations with President Trump about the quality of soccer in the top United States league, Major League Soccer.
"One of the FIFA president's duties is to listen to stakeholders' perspectives about relevant topics for football," FIFA said in a statement last week in response to questions about Infantino's discussions with Pérez and others about changes to the club game. "FIFA believes that an open and constructive dialogue between different members of the football community is essential to find the right balance and the best solutions for the future of the game."
FIFA's 2021 club world championship will feature 25 teams, with a playoff match reducing the field to 24 teams placed into eight groups of three teams. In the current format for the tournament, group winners would move into a knockout round that culminates in a final. Europe (eight) and South America (six) will provide the bulk of the teams for the event under a plan outlined by FIFA, which said the event would take place over 15 match days.

A South African Helped Save Russian Athletes From a Complete Ban

Texto completo: Penny Heyns, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, said she had opposed a blanket ban on Russian athletes.
Even before global antidoping leaders confirmed this week that Russia would be banished from top-level international sport for four years, the athletes' committee they consulted was expressing frustration that the punishment did not go far enough.
That athletes' group, led by Beckie Scott of Canada, an Olympic gold medalist in cross-country skiing, released a statement critical of the penalties on Sunday, the night before they were announced in Lausanne, Switzerland. The statement said anything short of a blanket ban of all Russian athletes would be an insufficient response to Russia's repeated violations of antidoping rules, and would only encourage further malfeasance.
But one other athlete whom the World Anti-Doping Agency consulted extensively -- a former swimmer from South Africa -- disagreed. And when the world's senior antidoping executives lined up on Monday to announce their decision, they said the views of the swimmer, Penny Heyns, had played a significant role.
Heyns, 45, has served on the committee charged with overseeing the Russian doping investigation since January, when Scott resigned over the agency's handling of the Russia scandal. In recent weeks, Heyns made a passionate defense of the importance of protecting innocent young Russian athletes, said Jonathan Taylor, the British lawyer who led the panel.
In her first interview since the announcement, Heyns told The New York Times that she had no regrets about the punishment, which bans Russia and its officials from major international sports but is likely to allow hundreds of Russian athletes to continue competing if they can prove they are clean. Heyns said she had made up her mind at a recent swimming event in Budapest, where teenage Russian swimmers showed great promise.
"They were 10 or 11 when all of this was going down; they are not part of the system," said Heyns, who won the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke events at the 1996 Olympics, becoming South Africa's first post-Apartheid era gold medalist. "They're totally innocent. We needed to take a decision that's looking after whole world."
Heyns said the panel had discussed a blanket ban, which is something she remembered from her childhood, as South Africa was barred from international sports for decades because of its apartheid policies. She said that the penalty was appropriate for the time, but that it had also "destroyed a lot of dreams" for young athletes.
Heyns argued that the mission of the doping authorities was to protect clean athletes everywhere. "It's our duty to ensure all clean athletes have the right to compete, including those from Russia who can honestly prove their innocence," she said.
The organization announced the ban for Russia on Monday after concluding that the country's authorities had manipulated or deleted thousands of files containing athlete antidoping data. That action makes it unlikely that scores of potential drug cheats who benefited from the state-run cheating program may never be punished. Officials said that any athletes who were linked to the doping scheme or the subsequent cover-up would be barred from international sports, and most likely be stripped of any medals.
But hundreds of Russians are likely to be cleared to participate as part of a neutral team at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, where the Russian flag, anthem and uniform will be outlawed. Heyns said that ban, which critics have labeled more symbolic than severe, was important.
"Russia does not exist," she said. "Looking at the way things have gone thus far, the manipulation and everything, I think what's more important is the word 'Russia' is gone."
Heyns said it was unfair to single out Russian athletes for special attention, even though the scale of the cheating program and the subsequent cover-up are among the biggest scandals in sports history.
One criticism is that the punishments do not go as far as those issued by track and field's governing body in 2015, penalties that remain in place today. Track's leaders have banished Russia from all events -- local, regional and international -- and have instituted a strict vetting process to allow individual athletes to participate under the rubric "Authorized Neutral Athlete."
Another criticism is that the ban announced Monday does not include high-profile competitions that are not world championships. The Russian team will take part in next summer's European soccer championships, for example, and Saint Petersburg will remain one of the 12 host cities. Russia also is expected to retain the hosting rights to the 2021 Champions League final, the biggest match in club soccer.
Heyns said the relevance of regional events did not factor into her opposition to a blanket ban.
"To be honest," Heyns said, "my focus was so much on the Olympic level that I didn't actually consider the continental events."
Heyns asked whether the very best athletes would even want to compete in events where Russia was excluded, suggesting that winning without having faced major rivals would be unsatisfactory to many elite competitors.
"Any athlete who is honestly a true competitor -- you want to compete against the best of the best," she said. "I'd be curious to know how some of the top athletes would feel about that."
She also disputed the level of athlete opposition. She said there were few, if any, objections to the proposed sanctions last week during a conference call organized by the International Olympic Committee that included athlete representatives from several sports.
"Nobody made a statement like, 'Why is there not a blanket ban?"' Heyns said. "If all these athletes were so upset, why didn't it come up?"
The I.O.C. provides half of the antidoping agency's funding, and its leader, Thomas Bach, has publicly opposed a blanket ban for Russia, even though the country has seemingly doubled down on its bad behavior. Bach, a German who won a gold medal in fencing at the 1976 Olympics, has said he favors "individual justice" over collective punishment.
Heyns said that she had not spoken to Scott, the outgoing chairwoman of the antidoping organization's athletes' committee, about their divergent views. She said, however, that Scott and the others critical of the ban should play a part in the process that will clear individual Russian athletes one by one.
"They should sit around the table and evaluate evidence these athletes bring in," Heyns said. "If our hearts are truly for the protection of clean athletes, and if these athletes give evidence and it's compelling, then they are clean."

Texto completo: White House targets conservatives with recent executive order, events
The setting was the gilded East Room at the White House as President Trump signed an executive order targeting anti-Semitic harassment on U.S. college campuses. But despite mention of the Holocaust and modern-day hate crimes, the atmosphere was more MAGA campaign rally than solemn observance.
At the first of two Hanukkah-themed events Wednesday, Trump riffed about how much he has done for Israel while he invited members of the assembled crowd to share their thoughts and testify to his accomplishments.
But despite the ad-libbed nature of both events, the message the White House wanted to send heading into the 2020 election as it seeks to build support among Jewish conservatives and maintain the strong backing of evangelicals was clear: Trump is using support for Israel as the defining characteristic of fighting anti-Semitism.
'With one voice, we vow to crush the monstrous evil of anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it appears,' Trump said. 'We have a lot of people in government working very, very hard on that, and we appreciate their work. It's not easy.'
Several members of the audience wore red yarmulkes stamped 'TRUMP,' which the president noted with delight.
Trump hosted a second Hanukkah reception at the White House later Wednesday, drawing an odd-bedfellows collection of Jewish friends and advisers for the two events that included sports owner Bob Kraft, legal scholar Alan Dershowitz, Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer and developer Charles Kushner, whose son Jared is Trump's close adviser and son-in-law.
'I'm very proud that the Jewish faith is a cherished part of our family,' Trump said. 'Very proud of it.'
Trump hopes to expand his support among conservative Jews in his 2020 reelection effort, although national polls do not suggest that Republicans are gaining much ground with Jewish voters. He points to his support for Israel and focuses on steps he has taken to reverse policies enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Polling during the 2018 election year from Gallup found that 26-percent of all U.S. Jews approved of Trump while 71 percent disapproved. A 2019 survey by the American Jewish Committee found 26 percent of Jews had a favorable view of Trump while 71-percent were unfavorable.
In a briefing for reporters Thursday, a Trump campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal campaign strategy, said that a 'Jewish Voices For Trump' coalition effort will be launched early next year, along with groups aimed at evangelicals and Catholics.
'The real test of Jewish voting intentions is not contained in our survey. It would be in the state of Florida,' said David Harris, chief executive of the AJC, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.
Florida is the largest state among the five to seven swing states considered the keys to an electoral college victory, and the one with the largest Jewish population.
'Clearly the president believes that he can make a strong case to those Jewish voters, I think largely by trying to depict the Democratic Party through the faces of people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib,' Harris said, referring to freshman Democratic congresswomen from Minnesota and Michigan, respectively, whose remarks about Israel have angered Democratic colleagues as well as Republicans.
Trump referred to what he called 'far-left members of Congress' in an address Saturday at the conservative Israeli American Council in Florida, which had a heavily partisan flavor despite being an official presidential event.
The president was greeted with chants of 'Four More Years,' and the audience booed both Trump's mention of Democratic members of Congress and the news media.
'You've got to be very careful. Make no mistake: Radical lawmakers who support the BDS movement are advancing anti-Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda,' Trump said, referring to the efforts to boycott, divest from or sanction Israel over human rights claims.
' . . . It's rhetorically and morally unacceptable. One lawmaker even wrote that Israel has hypnotized the world, and said, 'Support for Israel is all about the Benjamins,' ' Trump said, referring to Omar's suggestion, in a tweet, that Israel's allies in American politics were motivated by money rather than principle.
House Democrats rebuked Omar for 'anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters,' and she apologized.
Trump's own history of invoking Jewish stereotypes went unmentioned at the event. In August, Trump said Jews who vote for Democrats are showing 'either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.'
Critics said the president's remarks promoted anti-Semitic stereotypes about the loyalty of American Jews, but Trump doubled down a day later.
'In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people, and you're being very disloyal to Israel, and only weak people would say anything other than that,' he said then.
Jared Kushner cited a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes and other incidents in the United States in an essay Wednesday in the New York Times promoting the executive order. He referred to what he called discriminatory treatment of Jewish or pro-Israel students whose views do not align with liberal campus orthodoxy.
'It has become fashionable among Jew haters to characterize any discriminatory behavior " no matter how loathsome " not as criticism of Jews, but of Israel. This is a lie,' Kushner wrote. 'Especially on college campuses, where discrimination, harassment and intimidation of Jewish students has become commonplace and is routinely, but wrongly, justified.'
Kushner cited statistics from an Anti-Defamation League report that was published with a cover photo of white-supremacist marchers in Charlottesville in 2017 " an event that marked a low point for Trump.
Some of the marchers during the deadly rally chanted 'Jews will not replace us,' but Trump struggled to denounce the marchers. Trump, whose winning coalition in 2016 was heavily white and socially conservative, said there were 'very fine people on both sides' of the Charlottesville protest.
At each of the Jewish-related events in recent days, Trump listed actions he has taken in support of Israel that are broadly supported by conservative American Jews.
His list included relocating the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem despite Palestinian claims to the city, withdrawing from the international nuclear deal with Iran and granting U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. All are opposed by mainstream American Jewish organizations and many Democrats in Congress.
His declaration that he is the most pro-Israel American president ever also plays well with many conservative evangelical Christian voters, who will be crucial to Trump's reelection.
'I believe President Trump is the most pro-faith president in history,' evangelical pastor Robert Jeffress said when Trump invited him to speak at the White House event Wednesday.
'Mr. President, you know, Jewish and Christian believers alike believe what God said to Abraham in Genesis 12 " that God would bless those who bless Israel and He would curse those who curse Israel,' he said.
The executive order flows from legislative proposals that have stalled despite bipartisan support. Liberal Jewish groups are nonetheless skeptical, arguing that the order can be used to silence political speech the administration doesn't like.
The order extends federal civil rights protections to Jews as an identified ethnic group and not just a religious one. It allows the government to consider discrimination against the group as a violation of a key civil rights law, meaning schools could lose federal funding if they fail to combat discrimination against Jewish students.
Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of the center-left Jewish group J-Street, said the order 'appears designed less to combat anti-Semitism than to have a chilling effect on free speech and to crack down on campus critics of Israel.'
Jack Rosen, president of the American Jewish Congress, said in an interview that 'the president did the right thing.'
Jewish college kids harassed or threatened by activists whose beef is with Israel should be protected by the federal government, Rosen said.
'Why should any student on a college campus go to school tomorrow morning in fear?' Rosen said.
His organization does not endorse candidates, and Rosen demurred on the question of whether Trump is using things such as the executive order to appeal to Jewish voters.
'We support some actions and don't support others he does,' Rosen said.

Texto completo: El Comité Judicial de la Cámara de Representantes se reunió este miércoles a las siete de la tarde (hora del este) para argumentar a favor o en contra de el juicio político contra Donald Trump y proponer modificaciones a los cargos de los que se acusa al presidente. Pero el horario de este encuentro en el Congreso, que podría acabar después de media noche, tiene a muchos desconcertados.
Esta sesión nocturna forma parte de una reunión de varios días en la que los 41 miembros del Comité Judicial debaten, enmiendan y votan los cargos del juicio político que han propuesto los demócratas. En la mañana del jueves, el comité se volverá a reunir para y se espera que durante la tarde apruebe los cargos y los envíe a la Cámara de Representantes para su votación.
Los 24 demócratas y 17 republicanos que se reúnen la noche de este miércoles tendrán cinco minutos para hacer sus declaraciones de apertura, algo que les podría llevar varias horas. El plan de los demócratas para el día siguiente es, según publica The New York Times, pasar realmente al trabajo de modificación de las acusaciones con propuestas y enmiendas que pueden llevar a cambios importantes o a alteraciones menores. En principio, no se esperan grandes giros.
The Times explica que en este proceso legislativo, conocido como markup (anotaciones), los republicanos pueden quejarse incluso sin cambiar los artículos. ¿Cómo? Proponiendo gran cantidad de mociones que obliguen al comité a votar y que, por tanto, demoren los procedimientos . En cualquier caso, dichas enmiendas serán simbólicas para demostrar a los votantes de Trump que los republicanos están luchando contra el juicio político.
En estas reuniones no habrá testigos. Solo estarán presentes los miembros del comité aunque puede haber aportaciones puntuales de los abogados y de otros asistentes.

Russian music concerts offer a pleasing collusion

Texto completo: The Taos Chamber Music Group celebrates the holidays with a weekend of Russian music featuring works by Alexander Borodin, Sergei Prokofiev and Anton Arensky. The concerts Friday through Sunday (Dec. 13-15) at 5:30 p.m. each day, will be given at the group's performance home, the Arthur Bell Auditorium at the Harwood Museum of Art, 238 Ledoux Street.
Among performers will be virtuoso Russian pianist Gleb Ivanov, who begins the weekend on Friday with a solo recital of Prokofiev piano sonatas.
Then, on Saturday and Sunday, he joins TCMG members L.P. How on violin, Sally Guenther on cello, Nancy Laupheimer on flute and Samantha Brenner on bassoon for chamber music by Borodin ("Piano Trio in D Major"), Mikhail Glinka ("Trio pathétique in D minor") and Arensky ("Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor").
This program is titled "Return to Russia" as the group has done Russian music before with Ivanov, who will be in Taos for his eighth year with TCMG, according to executive director Laupheimer.
Called "a young super-virtuoso with musical sensitivity and an appreciation of style to go with the thunder and lightning" by The New York Times , Ivanov came to the United States from Moscow after winning the Young Concert Artists International Auditions in 2005.
He was presented at Carnegie's Zankel Hall and at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., as well as Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. He has been the recipient of numerous other awards and has traveled extensively as a recital and concerto soloist.
Recently, Ivanov has performed the Herculean feat of playing all of Prokofiev's piano sonatas (there are nine) on consecutive weekends at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston and at Bargemusic in New York City. Laupheimer said she thought "it would be a wonderful and rare opportunity for audiences in New Mexico to hear such a program. The intensity of Prokofiev's music combined with Ivanov's prodigious talent will make for an incredibly powerful live performance."
Ivanov has chosen the first three of Prokofiev's piano sonatas, which Laupheimer said are imbued with brilliance (and even a particular Russian fairy-tale quality in the second) for the first half of the program. "The eighth sonata, one of Prokofiev's 'War Sonatas,' will be on the second half," she said. "Its mood and style shift dramatically, at times underlining the chaos of World War II, but returning to a pronounced Romanticism and optimistic vision for the future that may have been informed by his affair with Mira Abramovna Mendelson, whom he would leave his wife to marry."
The Return to Russia program on Saturday and Sunday shifts to older 19th-century Russian composers, bringing attention to less performed gems of the repertoire.
Borodin, best known for orchestral music such as the evocative "Steppes of Central Asia," was an accomplished research scientist and lecturer by profession, composing on the side even though he was considered one of Russia's greatest natural talents, according to Laupheimer. "Perhaps demands for time were why his youthful 'Piano Trio in D Major' went unfinished," she said. "It was his first composition effort, beginning in 1850 and not completed until 1860 when he was on a scientific and cultural tour of Western Europe. The first three movements follow a classical format, but the trio lacks a finale."
Another gem is Glinka's "Trio pathétique," in which bassoonist Brenner makes her TCMG debut. Before moving to Taos recently, Brenner was principal bassoonist of the Mexico City Philharmonic and Mineria Symphony Orchestra. This past year she was acting principal bassoonist with the Auckland Philharmonic in New Zealand, a position she held previously with the National Philharmonic in the Washington, D.C., area.
Glinka's trio was written in 1832 for the unusual combination of clarinet, bassoon and piano, but for these performances flutist Laupheimer will take on the clarinet part. There is a quote at the beginning of the piece in French, which translates, "I have known love only through the unhappiness it causes." Glinka as an ardent 28-year-old had not been happy in relationships when he composed the work, which is probably why "pathétique" is part of the title.
The program will conclude with Arensky's elegiac "First Piano Trio in D minor," written at the end of the 19th century. Carrying on the Russian tradition started by Tchaikovsky, the piece was composed as a memorial to his (and Tchaikovsky's) friend, the cellist Karl Davidoff, who died in 1889.
Davidoff had been director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory when Arensky was a student there, and was recognized as the founder of the Russian school of cello playing. The prominent role of the cello in the piece is a tribute to that. For this work (and the Borodin), Ivanov, How and Guenther will unite for the sixth time as a now finely tuned piano trio.
TCMG's 27th season continues through May 2020.
Tickets are $25 and $12 for students. A 20 percent discount for museum members is only available with purchase at the museum store. A dinner discount is also offered to concertgoers after the performances from Doc Martin's, Martyrs, the Gorge Bar & Grill and Lambert's restaurants.

Osili: City must erase disparities

Texto completo: For years, Indianapolis' elected officials and other leaders, either through inaction or through deliberate public policy, have contributed to the wide disparities that exist here among racial and neighborhood lines.
That's according to Vop Osili, president of the Indianapolis City-County Council, who says it is past time for all local leaders – whether working in transit or criminal justice or education or public office – to shed that history and begin righting the ship together.
More than 100 such leaders were expected to turn out for one of two workshops Wednesday held by the Government Alliance on Race and Equity, which helps communities address inequities created through public policy.
Osili, a Democrat who has been touring the country to bring such an effort to Indianapolis, publicly announced the workshops Tuesday.
"How do we better accomplish outcomes that have benefits for all of our members of our community," Osili said in an interview with IndyStar, "understanding that historically certain members of our community have not had the benefit, I think, of purposeful thought and intentional thought on outcomes."
Seeking great equity in resources Asked for an example, Osili brought up infrastructure funding.
City-county councilors have historically pushed for an equal amount of road funding in each of the 25 districts every year, Osili said. But should the council approve another $1 million-plus project on 71st Street when there are still neighborhoods without sidewalks?
"How are we thinking about the decisions that we make in our primary role, which is the city and county budget," Osili said. "Are we thinking equitably about the distribution of our resources?"
There's little surprise that Indianapolis is home to plenty of disparities. The Monon Trail is a good illustration cited by IUPUI researchers in 2015. At the northern end of the trail, around 96th Street, a person's average life expectancy is 83.5 years. As you navigate south, though, that expectancy drops and drops – until you reach the southern end, at 10th Street, where the expectancy is just 69.4 years, a number worse than Iraq's.
A simple drive through many Indianapolis neighborhoods will confirm what the research and data say. In Brookside are crumbling and abandoned homes that would never be spotted in some of the city's more affluent neighborhoods. Some apartment and condo complexes near 42nd Street and Post Road have struggled as economic opportunities have dissipated in the area. There are neighborhoods without streetlights or sidewalks. A child's opportunity in school can vary dramatically based on a ZIP code.
Disparities are evident elsewhere, too. The criminal justice system is overwhelmingly represented by black men, and young black males are four times more likely than everyone else to fall victim in the city's yearslong struggle with criminal homicides.
Research that appeared in the New York Times in 2016 put it plainly: Indianapolis is one of the worst places to live if you're poor.
The adversity can seem too expansive to fix any time soon. Osili, though, insists that what may begin as a workshop for community leaders has the potential to one day transform the city into a national leader.
Osili pointed to recent announcements from other parts of the community as proof of a growing desire to solve the problem.
The Indy Chamber and other business leaders are working with Mayor Joe Hogsett's administration to require employers seeking public incentives to first provide higher pay and help in addressing issues like child care access.
The Central Indiana Community Foundation – which funded the workshops Wednesday – is now focused on addressing systemic racism through the work of community nonprofits.
Overcoming resistance and denial So Osili is looking at himself, at the City-County Council and other agencies around town and wondering what the public sector can do to also make a difference. He acknowledged that it will be difficult to overcome resistance and denial. It's human nature, he said.
"It is just resistance to acknowledging that we actually might have some additional things we could look at in ourselves," Osili said. "I realize I've got biases. And I'm kind of thinking, you know, if I've got them, most of other folks probably have them, too. So can we agree to take the time to look a little deeper? Because it'll make it a lot easier when we're making decisions in a collective setting."
That is why starting this week, Osili said, he will push for his fellow community leaders to learn something that does not come easy in Indianapolis: Ditching their "Midwestern nice" to begin having uncomfortable conversations about race, inequity and bias.
Then, Osili said, public leaders can begin the work of reversing hundreds of years of policy and inaction that helped create haves and have-nots in Indianapolis.
"I don't think we can probably get it done in like a couple of days, right? Not four days, not four months, probably not four years," Osili said. "But every day that we commit to it has the potential to significantly impact the outcomes of many, many lives."

Texto completo: "Try to imagine not having a family. You come as individual family. The grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins — they're not here."

Gov. Kay Ivey's office on Tuesday was noncommittal about whether she would allow refugee resettlement in Alabama under new terms set by the Trump administration.
In September, the president signed an executive order requiring state governments and localities to "both consent, in writing, to the resettlement of refugees within the state and locality, before refugees are resettled within that state and locality under the program."
"Our office is working through this executive order, and we will be compliant with what the Trump administration has set forth," Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ivey, wrote in an email on Tuesday. "This would be a decision made in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, and we intend to follow the proper guidelines."
Mike Lewis, a spokesman for the Alabama attorney general's office, wrote in an email Wednesday that "no request has been made to the state that we accept any refugees."
"If and when that decision needed to be made, the Governor and Attorney General would certainly work in consultation with one another, and the relevant locality/localities," he wrote.
Messages seeking comment were sent to the Mobile County Commission on Tuesday and Wednesday. Mobile is the home of Catholic Social Services, which handles refugee settlement in Alabama. Messages were left with Catholic Social Services on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Resettlement agencies have sued the administration over the order in federal court. The New York Times reports a federal judge is expected to rule on a motion to block the executive order by the end of January.
The Trump order gave the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 90 days to develop a process consistent with the consent of the state and locality. That would be Dec. 26.
"That process shall provide that, if either a State or locality has not provided consent to receive refugees under the Program, then refugees should not be resettled within that State or locality," the order says.
The order also says that the Secretary could move to settle refugees in an area that had not given consent if not doing so would be inconsistent with refugee policy. Such moves would need the approval of the president.
Very few refugees end up in Alabama. According to a U.S. Department of State report to Congress, 38 refugees were settled in Alabama in fiscal year 2018, which ran from Oct. 1, 2017 to Sept. 30, 2018. Refugees are generally defined as those who have been persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. Refugees typically go through an extensive vetting process that can last years.
Several state governors have signaled that they will accept refugees, including Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, and Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat.
In 2015, then-Gov. Robert Bentley said he would not accept refugees from Syria, following an attack in in Paris that left 129 people dead. Bentley acknowledged at the time there were no credible terrorist threats directed at Alabama. Refugee groups noted the rigorous vetting process that refugees face, and that they have legal residence once they are settled in the state.
Bentley later sued the federal government, suggesting that they had failed to provide information about refugees, but the lawsuit was eventually dismissed. The federal government noted Alabama had opted out of a federal refugee resettlement program in 2001.
Jim Mather, a pastor in Mobile who has worked with refugees for over a decade, said in a phone interview Tuesday that not allowing refugees to settle in Alabama would send "the wrong signal."
Mather said the families he works come from a number of different places, including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. They try to keep a low profile, he said, and are often cut off from family. One Iraqi refugee Mather worked with experienced a premature birth.
"So we held a baby shower in our home," he said. "Try to imagine not having a family. You come as individual family. The grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins — they're not here."

OFFICIAL: ASSAILANTS LINKED TO HATE GROUP

Texto completo: Officials identified the assailants Wednesday who fatally shot a detective and then killed three in the targeted attack of a Jersey City kosher market as a man and woman investigators also consider prime suspects in a weekend homicide.
New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal identified the pair as David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, and said they are suspected of killing a man Saturday night in neighboring Bayonne, New Jersey whose body was later found stuffed in the trunk of a Lincoln Town Car.
The victim was identified as Michael Rumberger, 34, of Jersey City, a livery driver.
Anderson and Graham were shot to death by cops Tuesday afternoon following their attack on the grocery store and an hourslong shootout that sent loud bursts of gunfire echoing off buildings in a neighborhood of homes and shops. A grade school across the street from the market was put on lockdown during the shootout.
A law enforcement source said Wednesday that Anderson and Graham were followers of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as a hate group. Grewal and other members of law enforcement Wednesday declined to discuss the assailants' motivation or ideology, citing the ongoing investigation.
"We are working to learn more about the shooters' motivations, and whether anyone besides the two gunmen may have been involved," Grewal said at a news conference.
Veteran Jersey City Det. Joseph Seals, 40, was shot to death by the suspects in a Jersey City cemetery shortly before they set out for the market, police said. Seals may have tried to question the occupants of a vehicle before they shot him, police said.
The three victims inside the store were identified Wednesday as Mindy Ferencz, 33, who ran the market with her husband; Miguel Douglas, 49 and Moshe Deutch, 24. Another unidentified individual escaped the store as the shooting began, officials said.
Also Wednesday, law enforcement officials provided new details about the shootout, which began at about 12:30 p.m. near the Bayview Cemetery, about a mile from the kosher grocery store, and where Seals, 40, was cut down by gunfire. Seals, a 15-year veteran of the department who worked for a unit called Cease Fire, had led the department in the number of illegal guns removed from the streets in recent years.
After killing the detective, police said, the assailants got into a stolen U-Haul van and headed toward the JC Kosher Supermarket, about a mile away in the Jersey City neighborhood of Greenville, a community long home to a sizable African-American population and in recent years, a growing community of Orthodox Jews. The kosher grocery is considered a focal point for the local Jewish community.
Surveillance video footage shows the assailants driving slowly through Jersey City's streets, and then stopping outside the supermarket. They calmly got out of the van and immediately opened fire with long rifles.
The two shot and killed the three victims inside the store, police said. 
A fourth bystander was shot at the store when the attackers burst in, but escaped, Grewal said. His name was not released. Chabad Rabbi Moshe Schapiro said he spoke with the survivor at a hospital.
"He said the guy next to him fell to the ground," Schapiro said. "He suffered two gunshot wounds but managed to run out of the store and climb over fences."
Fulop said Wednesday it's clear that the assailants targeted a Jewish market but he refused to call it an anti-Semitic attack.
"Last night after extensive review ... it has now become clear from the cameras that these two individuals targeted the Kosher grocery location," Fulop said in a tweet. "There were multiple other people on the street so there were many other targets available to them that they bypassed to attack that place, so it was clearly that was their target and they intended to harm people inside," he said.
One of the assailants had published anti-Semitic and anti-police posts online, and investigators found a "manifesto-style" note inside the assailants' van, according to The New York Times.
A law enforcement source Wednesday said Anderson and Graham followed the Black Hebrew Israelite movement and FBI agents interviewed members in Harlem Wednesday about the couple. 
The  Black Hebrew Israelite movement is a black nationalist theology with some sects being known for their fierce condemnations of white and Jewish people.
Anderson served about four months in prison in New Jersey on weapons charges and was paroled in 2011, authorities said.
Investigators said they also found an operable pipe bomb in the back of the pair's stolen U-Haul van.
Chabad Rabbi Moshe Schapiro, who shops at the kosher store and attends a synagogue next door, said he spoke with the store owner, Moishe Ferencz.
"He told me he had just walked out of the store into the synagogue not five feet away just before this happened, and then he couldn't get back for hours," Schapiro said. "His wife was inside the store. He said, 'I hope my wife is safe.' "
Seals had been on the Jersey City Police Department since 2006. In addition to his work with the illegal guns unit, he was cited for heroism in a Christmas Eve 2008 incident in which he and another officer burst through the window of a home and stopped a sexual assault that was being carried out against a 41-year-old woman.
"It's a really tough day for the city of Jersey City," Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said at a news conference Tuesday. Seals, he said, "was one of the best officers for getting the most guns off the streets. He was a good cop."

Texto completo: The sprawling downtown plant where the Los Angeles Times is printed has been sold to a New York real estate developer that builds large-scale mixed-use complexes in Los Angeles and other cities.
Atlas Capital Group paid about $240 million for the 26-acre site on Olympic Boulevard alongside the Santa Monica Freeway where The Times is a tenant, according to people who know about the deal.
The seller was a partnership led by Los Angeles landlord and builder Harridge Development Group, which paid $120 million for the plant three years ago. In recent years, the industrial neighborhood where it lies has enjoyed a run-up in property values as the nearby Arts and Fashion districts have seen billions of dollars' worth of new residential, office and retail projects.

Just a few blocks from the printing plant, Atlas is developing the Row DTLA on Alameda Street, where Atlas and its partners are turning 2 million square feet of historic warehouses into offices, restaurants and stores while still serving as a hub for the local produce industry.
The Olympic printing plant was built by the newspaper in the late 1980s to replace obsolete printing operations at its downtown headquarters.
The Times became a tenant in the printing plant following the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization of its then-owner, Tribune Co., which ended in a 2012 agreement with creditors that spun off Tribune's real estate holdings into a separate company.
Harridge acquired the Olympic plant from that company in 2016 and was expected to redevelop the property.
Harridge retains a minority ownership in the complex, which has about 660,000 square feet of manufacturing and distribution space with about 15 acres of open space used primarily for parking and truck loading. It also has offices and a train dock for unloading shipments of newsprint.
The Times' lease expires at the end of 2023, according to real estate data provider CoStar. Plans for printing the paper after that date are unclear, but owner Patrick Soon-Shiong owns buildings in El Segundo, including an office building on Imperial Highway where he moved The Times' editorial and business operations last year.
A representative for The Times declined to comment on company plans to print the paper in the years ahead.
The Times also prints editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal at the Olympic Plant under contracts with those news organizations.
Officials of Atlas declined to talk, and Harridge did not respond to requests for comment about the sale or about plans for the Olympic plant, which has been considered for numerous development options in recent years.
Clippers owner Steve Ballmer pondered turning the site into a basketball arena, but is now focused on building a $1-billion complex in Inglewood across the street from a stadium that will be the home of the NFL's Rams and Chargers beginning in 2020.
Other uses considered for the Olympic plant site include residences, stores and so-called creative offices that are often fashioned from former industrial buildings.
Such offices have become especially popular in the Arts District, where companies such as Warner Music, music streaming service Spotify and online coupon firm Honey have staked out new digs. Exclusive private club Soho Warehouse recently opened on Santa Fe Avenue not far from the printing plant.
Tenants in creative fields "are oftentimes skipping over the downtown financial district and going straight to the Arts District," said real estate broker Brittany Winn of Cushman & Wakefield, who was not involved in the sale. "The problem is, there is a limited supply of the cool, creative buildings they are looking for."

Case of How A Murderer Should Get Resentenced

Texto completo: An Arizona death row inmate was granted a new sentencing to consider evidence of childhood abuse. The justices examined whether that required a hearing in a trial court.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday struggled to decide what kind of new sentencing an Arizona death row inmate was entitled to after a federal appeals court ruled that the trial judge who had condemned him to death failed to take account of evidence of abuse the inmate had endured as a child.
Several justices indicated that it may have been sufficient for the Arizona Supreme Court to consider whether the additional evidence would warrant a different sentence for the inmate, James McKinney, who was sentenced to death in 1993 for killing two people in their homes during separate burglaries.
In a decision last year, the State Supreme Court reweighed the evidence, now including information about the abuse Mr. McKinney had endured, and concluded that a death sentence was still warranted.
Requiring a new sentencing hearing before a jury could cause needless distress to the victims' families, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said.
"You're requiring a new jury sentencing 28 years after the murders and after the victims' families have been through this for three decades," he told Neal K. Katyal, a lawyer for Mr. McKinney.
Mr. Katyal responded that capital sentencing should not be done based on a paper record. "We're not talking about some technical violation here or something," he said. "We're talking about the heart of what capital punishment sentencing is all about, the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances."
Oramel H. Skinner, Arizona's solicitor general, said the state's Supreme Court was perfectly capable of imposing a new sentence based on the trial court record from the original sentencing.
In 2015, more than two decades after Mr. McKinney received the death sentence, a federal appeals court gave him another chance to challenge it.
The judge who sentenced Mr. McKinney to death had acknowledged that he had suffered childhood abuse that was "beyond the comprehension and understanding of most people." But the judge said he could not take that abuse into account in determining the right sentence because Arizona law allowed consideration of mitigating evidence only if it had a "causal nexus" to the crime.
That was an error of constitutional dimensions, the federal appeals court said. The court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ordered the state to impose a lesser sentence or to resentence Mr. McKinney. The state chose resentencing and asked the Arizona Supreme Court to conduct it.
The basic question for the justices, one that could affect 19 inmates in Arizona alone, was how the resentencing should take place.
Mr. Katyal said his client was entitled to a sentencing hearing in a state trial court, for two reasons. First, he said, a 2002 Supreme Court decision, Ring v. Arizona, ruled that juries, not judges, must make the factual findings to support death sentences.
The Ring decision was issued after Mr. McKinney's original sentencing, and a 2004 Supreme Court decision ruled that Ring did not apply retroactively.
But Mr. Katyal said the Ninth Circuit's ruling effectively reopened the case. That meant, he said, that Mr. McKinney was entitled to have a jury make the factual findings on the proper sentence.
Justice Elena Kagan did not seem persuaded by this part of Mr. Katyal's argument. "Is the defendant getting a kind of windfall if Ring applies?" she asked.
"The error here has nothing to do with Ring," Justice Kagan said. "And Ring only comes into the picture because the court is trying to correct a different error."
Later, though, addressing Mr. Skinner, Justice Kagan said, "It's a little bit strange to have a new proceeding where a rule that's been around for 20 years is not being applied."
In any event, Mr. Katyal said, moving to his second argument, resentencing by the State Supreme Court was improper under a different line of Supreme Court precedent. Those decisions, which required weighing all mitigating factors whether or not they were connected with the crime, contemplated resentencing to take place in a trial court.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer appeared unconvinced. "Why does it have to go back to the trial court?" he asked, adding, "In Arizona, the sentencer is the appellate court."
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. seemed inclined to reject both arguments, saying they would amount to a "double windfall."
"You have an entirely formalistic argument, and maybe it's right," Justice Alito said, "but why don't you just admit it's entirely formalistic?"
Mr. Katyal declined. "I couldn't disagree more profoundly with that," he said.

Texto completo: Tessa Majors, a freshman, was killed during an armed robbery in Morningside Park.
An 18-year-old Barnard freshman was fatally stabbed just after nightfall on Wednesday during a mugging in a park near the college's Manhattan campus, the police and college officials said.
In a campuswide letter sent around 11 p.m., Sian Leah Beilock, Barnard's president, identified the victim as Tessa Majors and said she had been killed in an armed robbery in Morningside Park.
"Tessa was just beginning her journey at Barnard and in life," Ms. Beilock wrote. "We mourn this devastating murder of an extraordinary young woman and member of our community."
Ms. Beilock said in the letter that she and Leslie Grinage, the dean of the college, had spoken with Ms. Majors's parents, who were on their way to New York. She also urged "anyone in need" to take advantage of the college's counseling services.
The official police account of the crime offered few details. About 5:30 p.m., officers with the New York Police Department responded to a report that a woman had been assaulted near West 116th Street and Morningside Drive, the police said.
When they arrived, the officers found an unconscious woman who had been stabbed multiple times. She was taken to Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the police said.
No one had been arrested and the investigation was continuing early Thursday, the police said.
Walking on Broadway near the Barnard campus on Wednesday night, Isabel Jauregui and Aja Johnson, both 20, said they had learned about the killing from campus news alerts.
Ms. Johnson, a Columbia student, said she had participated in an effort to help clean up the park and improve its reputation as dangerous. She said Ms. Majors's murder would affect students' perception of the park.
"This is going to re-demonize the image," she said.
Major crime in New York City was down about 1 percent this year through Dec. 1 compared with the same period last year, but murder was up about 8 percent, according to Police Department statistics. There had been 298 murders by Dec. 1, compared with 275 at that point in 2018, police data showed.
Ms. Jauregui, a Barnard student who works on the Columbia Spectator campus newspaper, said students were on edge.
"My friend is throwing up in the bathroom," she said. "She's so scared."
Niharika Rao, 19, and Layne Donovan, 18, two Barnard students, said the attack had left the entire campus shaken.
"Everybody knows each other," Ms. Donovan said.
Ms. Rao recalled encountering Ms. Majors once while eating on campus.
"She has green hair," Ms. Rao said. "I told her at Diana I liked her hair," referring to the Diana Center Cafe.
Tristen Pasternak, a Barnard sophomore, was waiting near campus for a shuttle home late Wednesday. She said she was not completely surprised to hear that someone had been attacked in the park.
"I used to go through there," Ms. Pasternak, 20, said. "It's always had a weird vibe."
This week is a so-called reading week for Barnard students, and many have been cramming for coming exams. Ms. Pasternak said that as she made her way around campus on Wednesday, she could tell that people were learning of the attack from the expressions on their faces as the looked at their phones.
"It's so horrifying" she said. "She should be going through finals like all of us." The main entrance to Barnard College on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Emon Hassan for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Rudy Giuliani's divorce battle ends, but legal troubles continue for Trump lawyer

Texto completo: NEW YORK — President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has reached a settlement in one of the two legal issues facing him — his acrimonious divorce, not the dealings in Ukraine that have attracted the attention of prosecutors and drawn him into the presidential impeachment spotlight.
The former New York City mayor and his third wife, Judith Nathan, agreed Tuesday to a confidential resolution that settles all disputes concerning support, assets and any other claims, Nathan's lawyer, Bernard Clair, said in an emailed statement.
"Mr. and Mrs. Giuliani intend to remain friends in the years to come, and they wish each other the best of luck in the future," Clair said.
The settlement cancels the scheduled January divorce trial in New York State Supreme Court that had been expected to reprise the couple's battles over multiple homes in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Florida, as well as country club memberships and more than $200,000 in monthly spending.
Nathan filed for divorce in April 2018, ending the couple's 15-year marriage. The proceeding quickly turned acrimonious, prompting New York City's tabloids and other media outlets to report that Giuliani ran up $900,000 in expenses during one six-month period, including more than $12,000 for his favorite cigars.
During one hearing, Nathan slapped her hand on a court table, angrily denying that she had taken everything out of one of the couple's homes after filing for divorce, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani cursed aloud in the courtroom during a proceeding when Clair mentioned Maria Rose Ryan, a New Hampshire hospital executive whom Giuliani escorted to a White House dinner, the Times reported.
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Michael Katz, who presided over the divorce case, advised the couple to settle out of court and end the acrimony and embarrassing personal disclosures.
Although Katz got his wish, Giuliani's legal difficulties are not over.
He's the subject of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in the same office Giuliani headed as the Manhattan U. S. Attorney, before he became New York City mayor in 1993.
The investigation focuses in part on Giuliani's work with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The Soviet-born business associates and legal clients helped Giuliani seek damaging information in Ukraine about the family of Joe Biden, the former U. S. vice president who is vying to challenge Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
U. S. counterintelligence investigators have been examining Giuliani's work with Parnas and Fruman at least since early 2019, USA TODAY reported in October.
Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing and said he has no information about the investigation.
Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman pushed for Trump to remove Marie Yovanovitch as the U. S. ambassador to Ukraine, an episode that was featured during the Trump impeachment hearings.
Separately, Parnas, Fruman and two other suspects were indicted in October on federal criminal charges of scheming to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars in foreign money to U. S. election candidates and campaign committees. All four have pleaded not guilty.
The funding included $325,000 that went to a political action committee formed to support Trump. Parnas and Fruman falsely listed the source of that money as a company they controlled, the indictment charged.
Giuliani's dealings with Parnas and Fruman pushed the three men into the congressional impeachment spotlight. Giuliani and Fruman failed to respond to congressional subpoenas to supply documents and testify about their efforts on behalf of Trump in Ukraine.
Trump has said he did not know Parnas and Fruman, even though the Giuliani associates have been shown smiling with him in White House photos. Reportedly angered by the disavowal, Parnas has signaled a willingness to provide information to House investigators if he were granted immunity from prosecution.

Texto completo: JERSEY CITY, N. J. – Authorities on Wednesday were investigating the motive behind the hourslong shooting rampage that killed six people and left this city across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan in mourning.
While local officials have called the shooting an anti-Semitic hate crime, state officials Wednesday cautioned the public against speculating on the motive as the investigation continues.
The dead included a police officer, three civilians and both suspects, who are also linked to a prior killing in Bayonne, New Jersey, police said. The bodies of the civilians were found inside a kosher supermarket Tuesday – the supermarket owner, a bodega employee and a shopper. Two other police officers were wounded.
The roar of gunfire drew a phalanx of police to the quaint, busy street that quickly devolved into a war zone. All the victims were struck by rounds thought to have been fired by the suspects, police said.
The focus of the killing was a kosher bodega in a section of the city that has become a gathering place for about 100 Orthodox Jewish families, authorities said.
Jersey City shooting rampage: Suspects targeted kosher supermarket
Here's what we know about the tragedy:
Who are the victims?
The suspects killed Officer Joseph Seals at a cemetery "at some point yesterday," said New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, offering little information about the circumstances of his death.
Police identified the other victims as Mindy Ferenz, 32, Moshe Deutsch, 24, and Miguel Douglas, 49.
A fourth civilian was injured in the shooting but is recovering, Grewal said.
Chabad Rabbi Moshe Schapiro said Ferenz was Deutsch's cousin, and that both were members of the local Orthodox community. Schapiro said Ferencz and her husband owned the bodega.
Williams Machazek, the pastor of Iglesia Nueva Vida in Newark, identified the third victim – whom he called Miguel Jason Rodriguez – as a congregant at his church who emigrated from Ecuador three years ago. Rodriguez has a wife and 11-year-old daughter and had been working at the bodega for about a year, Machazek said.
Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said two of the victims were borough natives.
Jersey City suspects identified
Authorities said Wednesday that the shooters were David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50.
Grewal said Anderson and Graham were also the prime suspects in the killing of a 34-year-old Jersey City man who was found beaten to death in the trunk of a car in Bayonne on Saturday night.
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said the suspects had resided in the city. He said the incident should be considered an act of hate.
“It should be viewed as a hate crime and called out aggressively . . . and quickly,” Fulop said at a press conference Wednesday. “There’s no question it was an attack on the Jewish community. There’s no other way to interpret it when you look at the facts. As a Holocaust survivor family, it’s important for me to recognize it for what it is. ”

What happened at the supermarket?
Details surrounding what happened at the supermaket were still developing, but officials provided a general timeline.
At 12:21 p. m. , a white U-Haul parked across from the JC Kosher supermarket, about a mile from the cemetery, Grewal said. Within seconds, Anderson exited the driver side door with a rifle, walked toward the market and began shooting. Graham followed him into the store, where the suspects remained throughout the shootout.
The suspects encountered four civilians inside the store, and one was able to escape.
At 12:38 p. m. , police got a 911 call from someone who discovered the body of Seals, Grewal said. At 12:43 p. m. , police arrived near the supermarket and engaged the suspects. At 3:25 p. m. , a police armored vehicle broke through the entryway of the supermarket. By 3:47 p. m. , the incident had ended, and authorities discovered bodies inside the store.
Officials later found a viable pipe bomb inside the U-Haul truck.
Have police identified a motive?
Grewal said Wednesday that despite "significant speculation," authorities had not determined a motive. Law enforcement was in the process of gathering digital and video evidence and conducting witness interviews, he said.
However, multiple media outlets including The New York Times reported that one of the suspects had published anti-Semitic posts on social media.
On Twitter and in an interview with MSNBC, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the shooting a "hate crime. "
President Donald Trump referenced the shooting at a Hanukkah reception at the White House Wednesday evening. "With one heart America weeps for the lives lost. With one voice we vow to crush the monstrous evil of antisemitism,” he said.
Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that targets anti-Semitism on college campuses by cutting off aid to schools that tolerate hate. Some critics, however, say the move is an effort to stifle free speech and criticism of Israel.
Fraudulent GoFundMe pages
At least one fake GoFundMe page cropped up Tuesday night claiming to solicit donations for the families of the victims, U. S. attorney Craig Carpenito said.
"A reprehensible group of people are online trying to profiteer off of the misfortune of others," Carpenito said. "I can’t find the words of how disgusting this conduct is. "
Carpenito said that was not aware of any bonafide pages and asked that anyone who had donated to a GoFundMe page to reach out to the FBI.
Who was Officer Joseph Seals?
The lone police officer killed was 40-year-old Seals, a 13-year veteran of the Jersey City Police Department who was promoted to detective two years ago.
Seals, a married father of five, joined the city police in 2006. He was promoted to detective in November 2017 and belonged to the department’s Cease Fire Unit. Seals was well known among police for his work taking guns off the street, Fulop said.
"He was a good cop," Fulop said of Seals. "I'm sure his children expected him to return home. "

Texto completo: Tallahassee author and New York Times Bestseller Jeff VanderMeer's work has been optioned for the small screen.
After "Annihilation" debuted in 2018 with such star-talent as Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac, Tessa Thompson and Gina Rodriguez, VanderMeer's "Borne"-universe series will take to television, the author announced last week.
AMC Studios acquired the rights to the three books — "Borne," "The Strange Bird" and recently-published "Dead Astronauts" — and will work toward making them a "potential series" for television, Hollywood news site Deadline reports.
VanderMeer will be a creative consultant and executive producer with the project, the author said on Facebook.
"Thrilled that AMC has optioned Dead Astronauts and the rest of the Borne universe for TV!" VanderMeer wrote. "I love AMC and I love the folks I'm working with."
He added that fans of his books could expect "a much greater fidelity to the material and casting" than the "Annihilation" adaptation.
VanderMeer and "Dead Astronauts" will be at Midtown Reader 6 p.m. Monday, Dec. 16, for a reading and book signing.

Texto completo: A visiting scholar at Middlebury College was invited to speak at a NATO conference in Denmark — until he wasn't.
The American Embassy in Copenhagen told Stanley Sloan he was no longer a keynote speaker at the event, which was subsequently canceled, according to The New York Times.
Sloan chalked this up to his open criticisms of President Trump's potential impact on trans-Atlantic relations.
Sloan wrote about the incident in a Facebook post:
"The letter from the council reads, in part, 'the Danish Atlantic Council sees no other alternative than to inform you that the Embassy of the United States has decided that your presence at the Conference is not possible, wherefore we with sincere and profound regrets have to inform you that we are not in position where we cannot comply with the instructions given by the Embassy of the United States.'"
He shared his speech for the event in the post.
Who is Stanley Sloan? In addition to being a visiting scholar in political science at the Vermont college, Sloan also has experience working in the government.
His Duco Experts profile provides insight into his background, which includes:
Working as a research manager and specialist at the Congressional Research Service.
Holding positions in the CIA.
Serving in the U.S. Air Force as a commissioned officer.
Founding the Atlantic Community Initiative.
Working as a consultant for the National Defense University Center for Transatlantic Security Studies.

Texto completo: The technology investment powerhouse sold its shares as its pushes the companies it bets on to seek profits and long-term stability.
SAN FRANCISCO -- The SoftBank Vision Fund has sold its stake in Wag, the troubled dog-walking start-up, back to the company at a loss, according to two people briefed on the deal, in a further sign of turmoil for the Japanese investment powerhouse that has bet big and lost big on the technologies of the future.
Garrett Smallwood, who became Wag's chief executive in November, said on Monday in an internal memo viewed by The New York Times that Wag and SoftBank were "amicably parting ways." Mr. Smallwood characterized the move as part of Wag's new plan to "refocus on delivering sustainable growth."
Mr. Smallwood's memo said a number of employees were laid off Monday as part of that plan, which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
Wag's unusual business model -- like Uber, but for dog walking -- symbolized for many the frothiness of the technology investment bubble. Almost two years ago, SoftBank agreed to invest $ 300 million in Wag.
But the Vision Fund has been since battered by its investment in WeWork, the office company that has shaken the start-up scene with the crash of its initial public offering in September. SoftBank Group of Japan, which started the Vision Fund, said last month that it had taken a $ 4.6 billion hit from its WeWork investment.
WeWork's flameout, which included the departure of its colorful founder and an emergency bailout by SoftBank, left many other cash-burning companies wondering if they would face similar fates. Start-ups have been increasingly singing the praises of profits and "sustainable growth" ever since.
SoftBank, WeWork's largest investor, has pushed its portfolio companies to moderate their growth and make plans to turn a profit. Other unprofitable start-ups have worked to lower their costs and hoard cash in case of a market downturn.
Wag's troubles have been particularly pronounced. After its investment, the Vision Fund brought in Hilary Schneider, former chief executive of LifeLock, to lead an aggressive expansion.
But it lost ground to Rover, its top competitor. Reports of lost dogs and internal struggles hurt business.
The company endured several rounds of layoffs this year. In November, Ms. Schneider stepped down. Her replacement, Mr. Smallwood, disagreed with SoftBank about Wag's strategy, the people familiar with the matter said.
Wag entertained deal talks with Rover and with Petco, the pet supply company, the people said. But they did not get very far, and SoftBank ultimately agreed to be bought out of its shares at a lower price. SoftBank did not give Wag the entire $ 300 million it had agreed to invest, one of the people said.
Wag's other investors include Battery Ventures, General Catalyst and ACME Capital, according to PitchBook, which operates an investment database.

Inspector General Says Official at Interior Dept. Violated Ethics Rules

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A top Interior Department official broke a federal ethics rule by improperly meeting with his former employer, a conservative research organization, to discuss the rollback of endangered species protections that the group had been pushing, the department's internal watchdog said in a report published Tuesday.
The watchdog, the Interior Department's inspector general, concluded that the official, Douglas W. Domenech, an assistant Interior secretary for the office with stewardship of the nation's oceans and coasts, violated federal rules in April 2017 when he met with representatives of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, where he was working before he joined the Trump administration, creating the appearance of a conflict of interest.
A separate inspector general investigation made public Tuesday cleared the Interior secretary, David Bernhardt, of charges that he improperly tried to influence or delay a scientific report on the effects of pesticides on endangered species. The inspector general found that Mr. Bernhardt had intervened in the writing of the report, which likely delayed its publication and may have changed some of its content. But the investigation concluded that Mr. Bernhardt's actions, which were first reported in a New York Times investigation, did not constitute an ethics violation and that none of his former lobbying clients would have been affected by the outcome of the report.
The Texas Public Policy Foundation, which has received substantial funding from Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have fought environmental regulations, has salted the Trump administration with many of its top officials, elevating its influence and prestige.
Federal ethics laws prohibit government officials from meeting with their former employers for at least a year after they take public office to prevent those employers from improperly influencing the outcomes of public policy. At the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which is based in Austin, Mr. Domenech led the group's Fueling Freedom Project, which aims to "explain the forgotten moral case for fossil fuels" by making the case that preserving oil, natural gas and coal shields the poor from higher energy costs.
Mr. Domenech, the father of conservative personality Ben Domenech, a co-founder of The Federalist and the husband of Meghan McCain, also worked on lawsuits designed to undo or weaken federal environmental policies. His April 2017 meeting with his former employer, which was still pursuing litigation against the Interior Department, was a clear violation of federal rules, the inspector general said.
The report highlighted an email Mr. Domenech sent to a Texas Public Policy Foundation attorney shortly after the meeting, saying, "Keep fighting."
Nicholas Goodwin, a spokesman for the Interior Department, wrote in an email, ""While Assistant Secretary Domenech did not do anything partial in meeting with a former employer, the Department concurs with the Inspector General's report that Assistant Secretary Domenech should have considered the appearance of meeting with a former employer." Mr. Goodwin said that Mr. Domenech has received additional ethics training and guidance, and said the Interior Department considers the matter resolved.
A spokeswoman for the Interior Department's inspector general declined to comment on the reports.
"This is now a familiar pattern: time and again, Trump appointees at the Department of the Interior think the rules don't apply to them, and they act accordingly," said Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, who requested the investigation. "These ethics rules are just common sense, to ensure public officials are actually acting in the public interest, and not in their own interest or in the interests of their prior employers," Mr. Udall said. "The Secretary should take strong public action to show that these violations won't be tolerated, and to make sure other Interior officials pay attention to the rules."
Representative Rob Bishop of Utah, the ranking Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, said the watchdog's report on Mr. Bernhardt exonerated the secretary. "Contrary to false allegations lodged at David Bernhardt during his Senate confirmation process, the Inspector General has confirmed Secretary Bernhardt never interfered with scientific findings," he said. "Once again, facts have revealed hyper partisanship that has blinded Democrats from focusing on real issues rather than attempting to besmirch dedicated public servants in this Administration."
A spokeswoman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation did not respond to a telephone message or email requesting comment.
The investigation of Mr. Domenech could shed light on higher-profile inquiries that the Interior Department's inspector general is conducting into the conduct of about half a dozen of President Trump's senior appointees at the Interior Department, which oversees the nation's public lands, waters, parks and endangered species. Several of the current investigations focus on Mr. Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who, like Mr. Domenech, has also been accused of creating the appearance that he is improperly working on behalf of former clients.
Mr. Trump's first appointee to lead the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year amid similar allegations of unethical conduct.
Mr. Bernhardt remains under investigation for allegations that he has personally pushed for the Interior Department to make policy changes that benefited his former clients at the expense of the agency's own scientific findings and the law, and that he violated federal lobbying laws by continuing to lobby on behalf of a former client after he dropped his lobbying registration.
The report on Mr. Domenech is expected to be the first of several investigations of Interior Department officials to be published in the coming months, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Mr. Domenech served in the Interior Department during nearly the entire George W. Bush administration, when the agency became ensnared in corruption scandals. In one such scandal, a deputy secretary of the interior, J. Steven Griles, was imprisoned for lying to a Senate committee about his ties to the lobbyist Jack Abramoff.
The inspector general's report noted that, as a former administration official with broad experience in office, Mr. Domenech had received ethics training on multiple occasions. But Mr. Domenech told investigators that he had not fully understood the ethics rules before attending the meetings with his former employer. However, in 2018 Mr. Domenech read a newspaper article describing similar meetings between an Interior Department official and a former employer, describing such meetings as inappropriate, and then told the agency's senior lawyers about his meetings.
According to the report, Mr. Domenech told the inspector general that he had scheduled two April 2017 meetings with the Texas Public Policy Foundation at the request of the organization's attorney. At the meetings, which were also attended by two other top Interior Department officials, the participants discussed two key topics of interest to the foundation: its litigation concerning the Bone Cave harvestman, an endangered orange spider whose preservation had affected Texas land use, and a legal dispute between the Interior Department and Texas residents near the state's Red River.
This year, the Interior Department announced that it was opening a review to consider removing Endangered Species Act protections on the Bone Cave harvestman, which has been protected under the law since 1988.
Mr. Domenech told agency watchdog officials that he was aware of the prohibition on government officials meeting with former employers but believed he was exempt from that rule because, while at the foundation, he had not worked specifically on policy matters involving the spider or the Red River case.
Mr. Domenech told investigators that his follow-up "Keep fighting" email, which also focused on the Bone Cave harvestman, was "his way of encouraging the T.P.P.R. to continue to pursue its constitutional rights," the report said, "and he denied that he was commenting on the litigation in any way."

Texto completo: The president imposed military rule on the island of Mindanao two and a half years ago, after an Islamist rebellion in the city of Marawi.
MANILA -- President Rodrigo Duterte announced on Tuesday that military rule in the southern Philippines would soon end, two and a half years after he imposed it in response to a rebellion by Islamic State militants in the city of Marawi.
The Philippine military and police recommended the move last week, saying that the security situation on the southern island of Mindanao, which includes Marawi, had improved. Salvador Panelo, Mr. Duterte's spokesman, said martial law on the island -- which empowers the military to carry out warrantless arrests and set up checkpoints, among other powers -- would expire on Dec. 31.
Mr. Panelo said the president was confident in "the capability of our security forces in maintaining the peace and security of Mindanao without extending martial law." He added, "The people of Mindanao are assured that any incipient major threat in the region would be nipped in the bud."
Hundreds of Islamist fighters from Southeast Asia and the Middle East took over Marawi in May 2017, with the goal of turning that city of 200,000 people into the center of an Islamic caliphate. The Philippines is mostly Catholic, but Mindanao has a substantial Muslim population.
Intense battles raged in Marawi for months, with the American and Australian militaries providing intelligence support to Philippine forces. More than 1,000 people were killed, including Isnilon Hapilon -- who was considered the Islamic State's leader in Southeast Asia -- and his key lieutenants.
The government declared victory in October, but it extended martial law at the end of 2017 and again a year later, saying that militants still posed a threat. A number of foreign militants are believed to have escaped the fighting in Marawi and fled to other restive parts of the southern Philippines, including Jolo island. Two Indonesian suicide bombers killed 23 people at a Catholic church on Jolo in January.
On Saturday, a soldier and four Filipino militants linked to the Islamic State were killed in a gun battle on Jolo. The military said troops had been hunting a faction of the Abu Sayyaf militant group led by Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who intelligence officials believe succeeded Mr. Hapilon as the Islamic State's leader in the Philippines.
Various armed groups have been active in the southern Philippines for decades.
Rights groups had objected to the continuing use of martial law, warning that it eroded constitutional values and noting that Mr. Duterte had raised the possibility of imposing it throughout the country. Drieza Abato Lininding, who became a rights activist after losing his home in the Marawi fighting, welcomed the presidential announcement on Tuesday.
"We've been consistent in our appeals in the past that martial law is not necessary in the fight against extremist groups," he said.
He said he hoped the military would immediately lift a curfew imposed in Marawi and nearby areas, saying it would help to spur economic recovery by safeguarding the freedom of movement.
"Marawi under martial law is like living in an internment camp, where people are forced to obey even if what they do is against their will," Mr. Lininding said.

Texto completo: The administration's food stamp cuts expose the cruel truth of Republican hypocrisy.
The Trump administration is highly selective in how it applies the standard of "self-sufficiency" for programs. To move food stamp beneficiaries toward that goal in all states, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue laid out a plan to strengthen work requirements for federal beneficiaries by April 2020.
The new rule makes it more difficult for states, no matter if they have areas of economic distress, to waive a requirement that able-bodied adults work at least 20 hours a week to maintain their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamp) benefits. The new measure could eliminate benefits for nearly 700,000 adults (it would not affect food stamp recipients with dependents, those over age 50, those with a disability or pregnant women).
"Government dependency has never been the American dream," Mr. Perdue said. "We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand."
But Republican distaste for "government handouts" seems to be strictly on a case-by-case basis. For example, with the Farm Bill, Mr. Perdue and others within the party are quite comfortable turning a blind eye to corporate welfare and crony capitalism. And "handouts" -- or if you prefer, "bailouts" -- to wealthy agribusinesses are not limited to the Farm Bill. Over the past year, as farmers throughout America were hit hard by President Trump's trade wars, the administration put together a $ 28 billion package that, according to some reports, could actually be overpaying some farmers for their losses.
The list goes on. Last year, House Republicans wanted to make it possible for 10 percent or more of the nation's commodity farms to receive unlimited subsidy payments. They sought to remove payment limitations from marketing assistance loan gains and loan-deficiency payments and tried to make it easier for general partnerships to reorganize as "family farms" and thus qualify for greater subsidy payments. The House version of the Farm Bill also exempted certain business arrangements -- partnerships, joint ventures, LLCs and Subchapter S corporations -- from the adjusted gross income means-testing provision, a measure that has so far limited commodity and conservation payments to the nation's wealthiest producers.
To be sure, the struggles of many farmers across the country are real and troubling, but the farm bailout's aid payments are not getting to some truly struggling farms. The Environmental Working Group found that most bailout money has gone to the nation's biggest farms. One farm has received $ 2.8 million in payments. With the aid they've received from the Trump administration this year, some farmers will net their highest profits in six years.
In essence, the Trump administration's measures are aimed at making it easier for wealthy Americans to receive unlimited government handouts -- to, in the words of Mr. Perdue, secure for themselves an "indefinitely giving hand."
Ever since the New Deal, the farm-focused portion of the Farm Bill has been geared toward providing economic aid to farmers -- and both farmers and Congress have "clearly moved away from the Jeffersonian ideal that championed minimal government and maximum personal independence," as R. Douglas Hurt writes in his book "Problems of Plenty." Farm Bill subsidy recipients are often deeply dependent on the federal government for support.
Yet rather than speaking of this as laziness, or bemoaning the burden this causes for taxpayers, Mr. Perdue and others within the administration bolster supports for the nation's largest, wealthiest agricultural producers.
This is not to suggest that there is no need in rural America for investment, reform and assistance. Many farm communities are hurting, but very few federal dollars go to the small to midsize farmers who actually need assistance. About 75 percent of total subsidy payments go to the largest 10 percent of farming companies. Agribusiness monopolies eat away at farmers' profit, from the seeds they grow to the chemicals they buy to the supply chain that gets their product to market. Tens of thousands of farms have gone under in recent years, and farmer suicides are alarmingly high. The opioid crisis is as intense in farm country as it is in other geographic areas, and many parts of rural America are plagued with the same "food deserts" that plague many urban neighborhoods.
Mr. Perdue isn't wrong when he says that the American dream does not consist of government dependency. But utter self-sufficiency is, if we are honest, impossible for most of us. People will always need a "safety net" of sorts -- but ideally, we should want people to find that support in community, family, churches and associations, as well as other local ties, not (or at least not only) through a distant government bureaucracy.
That said, at a time when many local social threads have broken, and our society is increasingly fragmented and frayed, there is a need for the government to provide support where no other support is available.
Mr. Perdue and others in Washington assume that stringent work requirements will push food stamp recipients to find the number of working hours necessary for eligibility. They suggest, without saying so explicitly, that any unemployment currently experienced by these beneficiaries is because of laziness, not lack of opportunity.
But many people in both rural and urban areas of America know that reality is a lot messier than this. Available work is not distributed evenly over every state or region. Threatening to take away someone's food stamps until they find steady work does nothing to solve the problems of postindustrial collapse, community breakdown, economic inequality, racism, systemic poverty, homelessness or drug addiction that have prompted many to find help in the first place -- just as a farm bailout does nothing to repair the economic, cultural and political conditions that are feeding our current farm crisis.
But as farmers' plight has grown, they've been offered the "indefinitely giving hand" that Mr. Perdue does not want food stamp recipients to receive. It seems hypocritical to demand that the poorest Americans pull themselves up by their bootstraps while covering the business risk of the nation's wealthiest agribusinesses.
So if Mr. Perdue and the Trump administration want to foster fiscal self-sufficiency, perhaps -- rather than starting with Americans struggling to put food on their table -- they should start at the top of the food chain instead.

Texto completo: When her daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella, were younger, Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli loved to give them a white Christmas by packing the family up and flying — presumably by private jet — to Colorado so they could all play in the snow and ski.
More recently, though, the Giannulli family has stayed in Los Angeles in their Bel Air mansion, as the former Hallmark Channel star told Parade magazine in 2017. But Loughlin said they still enjoyed other holiday traditions: picking out a tree and decorating it. She said she and her fashion-savvy, social media influencer daughters also loved to go shopping.
“It’s really about getting together with family,” Loughlin said.
This year, the former “Full House” star and her family again will be in Los Angeles, but things will be far less jolly. That’s because Loughlin, 55, is facing the possibility of years in prison for her alleged role in the college admissions scandal and has been hunkering down in rooms with lawyers to prepare her defense, Us Weekly is reporting in its new issue.
The actress best known as wholesome Aunt Becky is participating in “grueling” mock trials, essentially rehearsals for what could be the biggest, most consequential performance of her life: defending herself in federal court against bribery, fraud and money laundering charges.
According to Us Weekly, Loughlin, 55, is “adamant” that she wants to testify, even though it’s never a requirement for defendants to take the stand and defense attorneys often advise against it.
“Lori has no choice at this point but to take this to trial and hope for an acquittal or a hung jury,” a source told Us Weekly.
Loughlin apparently believes she can convince a jury that she’s a sympathetic figure, another insider said. She and her husband are charged with paying $500,000 in bribes to get Olivia Jade, 20, and Isabella, 21, fraudulently admitted to the University of Southern California.
Perhaps the veteran TV actress and media personality hopes she can use her star power and comfort in the spotlight to present herself as a loving mom who thought she was doing right by her daughters. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband also are expected to argue that they were duped into engaging in a bribery scheme concocted by college admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer.
“She feels they’ll believe that the accusations against her don’t merit criminal prosecution, that she truly thought she was making a legal contribution to charity,” the insider told Us Weekly.
Loughlin and Giannulli reportedly will argue that they believed the money they paid to Singer and to his alleged accomplices at USC were legitimate donations to Singer’s education nonprofit and to the school’s athletic programs.
“Mossimo strongly believes they were victims of a con and did nothing wrong,” an insider previously told Us Weekly.
But as much as Loughlin and Giannulli agree on some issues related to their “united front” defense, they disagree on others. That includes Loughlin’s reported earlier desire to strike a plea deal with prosecutors. Now, Loughlin wants to testify, and her husband doesn’t think it’s a good idea at all, Us Weekly reported.
“Mossimo doesn’t want to testify, but will be forced to if Lori does,” the insider told the outlet.
Another worry for the couple is that Olivia Jade and Isabella may be called as prosecution witnesses to testify against their parents. The indictment alleges that Olivia Jade and Isabella participated in the bribery scheme by posing for photos on rowing machines. The photos were used for fake athletic profiles that Singer and his accomplices created in order to present the sisters to admissions officers as crew team recruits.
The prospect of Olivia Jade and Isabella testifying terrifies Loughlin, Us Weekly reported.
“Lori’s bereft when she talks about the girls being forced to testify at their trial,” the insider said. “She doesn’t understand how it got to this point.”
Legal experts say that the decision to testify is always up to a defendant. Juries are instructed to not hold it against defendants when they don’t take the stand.
“There are so many risks to testifying that every attorney worth his salt thinks long and hard about recommending it,” according to a post on AbovetheLaw.com. “No matter what the prosecutor’s evidence, if a defendant testifies that is what will determine the verdict.”
When a defendant testifies, she loses her right to remain silent. It also shifts the burden of proof, which normally is on the prosecution, the legal site said in its post. After a defendant testifies, juries must now look at two “stories” of the case.
“Whether the prosecution made its case or not, if they don’t like how the defendant came off, either because they don’t believe him or just don’t like him, they’ll generally convict,” the post said.
Defense attorneys may see an advantage to putting certain defendants on the stand, notably professional, educated defendants in white-collar cases who have no prior criminal history, the New York Times said. Attorneys may believe they can adequately prepare these defendants to put their cases in the best light.
“The problem in calling the defendant to testify is the second act: cross-examination,” the New York Times said. “Prosecutors often can hardly contain themselves at the thought of getting a shot at the defendant.”
The prosecutor’s strategy usually involves making the defendant uncomfortable and forcing her to respond to questions she may not want to answer, which puts her credibility on the line, the Times added.
For an attorney to decide whether to put a client on the stand, “it comes down to figuring out how well the defendant can perform on the witness stand, particularly cross-examination, as measured against the strength of the government’s case.”
If it’s a matter of “performing,” Loughlin may have an advantage, since performing in TV and in films has been her livelihood for several decades.
In that sense, Loughlin has begun to treat her trial preparation like a “full-time job,” doing the mock trials, meeting with her lawyers or discussing strategy over email,” Us Weekly reported.
Still, the actress also realizes that this could be her last Christmas at home, if the trial doesn’t go her way. For that reason, Loughlin also is trying to spend as much time with her husband and daughters as possible, Us Weekly said. After all, she also once said, “It’s important to make the effort to see your family around the holidays.”

America’s top nonprofits bankroll attack on big tech

Texto completo: Washington • Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have discussed breaking up the biggest tech companies during their presidential campaigns. Federal and state regulators are investigating whether the companies have violated antitrust law.
But the activists and scholars who first raised concerns about the market power of companies like Facebook and Amazon don’t plan to stop there. They want to sell their thinking to the broader public, too. And they are amassing numerous wealthy backers to help them do it.
Major nonprofits, including the Ford and Hewlett foundations, have pledged millions of dollars toward taking on the power of the country’s corporate giants like Facebook and Amazon. Other supporters include groups run by George Soros, the billionaire financier, and Pierre Omidyar, an eBay founder.
The foundations regularly fund critical looks at capitalism. The Ford Foundation, for example, supports many organizations that study and fight inequality. The Hewlett Foundation, whose lineage goes back to a founder of Hewlett-Packard and has a $10 billion endowment, has put a slice of its money toward organizations reexamining the free market economic policies that dominate Washington.
But the financial support is reaching new heights, and it could help the activists keep pressure on Silicon Valley by building the sort of political might that has powered liberal policy victories on issues like civil rights and net neutrality. Activists recently announced a coalition to take on Amazon, for example, that includes organizers around the country.
One of the groups receiving foundation money is led by Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder who now publicly argues for breaking up the social media giant. His group, the Economic Security Project, is pooling some of the money and then distributing it to projects focused on antitrust and concentration concerns. Hughes, wealthy from his time at Facebook, has contributed some of the money himself.
The Economic Security Project plans to give antitrust activists $10 million over the next 18 months. On Tuesday, the organization will announce how it plans to spend the first $3 million, putting the money toward grassroots organizers, researchers at several Washington think tanks and a group that recruits artists to make graphics that “expose how our economy really works.”
The coming years will test whether the efforts of the advocates can harness the skepticism about large corporations and the wealthy that is animating the Democratic presidential primary race. Ultimately, these advocates hope to address corporate concentration in numerous businesses, including drugs and farm products, and combat rising economic inequality.
They have their work cut out for them. Tech companies spend tens of millions of dollars on lobbying every year. And antitrust issues hinge on dense questions of law and economics that don’t fit on a bumper sticker.
“It’s not just about trends and corporate accountability,” said Maria Torres-Springer, vice president for U.S. programs at the Ford Foundation, which has a $12 billion endowment. “It’s about creating and sustaining a movement that rebuilds political and economic power for everyday Americans.”
A leading beneficiary of the money is the Open Markets Institute, a research group whose focus on antitrust issues has been pivotal in making corporate concentration a matter of public debate. It expects to bring in more than $3 million in 2020, according to an internal document from the first half of this year. In 2016, before the group split off from a bigger organization, New America, its revenue topped out at just over $900,000.
This year, the Knight Foundation, which focuses on journalism, awarded Open Markets $2 million to study the impact that concentration among technology platforms has on the media. In September, the Ford Foundation gave it $200,000 to examine how tech monopolies affect workers. A public campaign it has led to break up Facebook will expand to include Google next year, according to Sarah Miller, the organization’s deputy director.
Hughes’ Economic Security Project is contributing to that campaign. It is also paying for Open Markets to conduct public opinion polling.
“Our view is you need an ecosystem,” Hughes said. “You need a community of people who generally share the same values but who, among themselves, may even have different approaches to the issues.”
Another progressive group, Jobs With Justice, plans to hold sessions next year explaining to people the antitrust case against tech companies in simple terms. In the draft script of the training, the session’s leader seizes on a simple metaphor, asking attendees to consider two lemonade stands.
The first stand belongs to someone whose family owns the local grocery store, so it gets its lemons free. The family’s neighbors, who opened a competing stand, aren’t so lucky. Over time, the first stand is able to slash its prices to undercut the second stand.
The session leader asks for a volunteer to play the person running the stand that can’t use a family connection to get free fruit. The volunteer has to decide whether to engage in a price war with the more powerful competitor while an organizer charts the volunteer’s dire financial situation on butcher paper.
Each situation ends with the volunteer’s lemonade stand closing and a revelation: Amazon, the session leader will tell participants, has used this tactic against its competitors.
“What we wanted to do was create some field materials, some training materials, just to even explain what a monopoly meant for people,” said Erica Smiley, Jobs With Justice’s executive director. “Outside of people maybe playing the board game, it’s kind of an old idea that maybe they learned in their fourth grade civics class but haven’t necessarily re-upped on.”
Smiley’s group is one participant in Athena, the new coalition organizing opposition to Amazon over antitrust, privacy and other concerns. The coalition says it wants to raise $15 million in its first three years.
Athena will receive money from Hughes’ fund, along with other groups trying to rally the grassroots to the cause.
Civil rights group Color of Change plans to use its funding from the project to pay for new hires to lead public campaigns around antitrust issues, while the Action Center on Race and the Economy will run “corporate campaigns designed to influence the public narrative on corporate concentration and win real victories for communities of color around the country.”
Other projects, like the artists’ group, are focused on finding new ways to explore the antitrust issue. Hughes’ group paid for a New York event in November — held by a project called the Museum of Capitalism — where people could play versions of the board game Monopoly that are meant to call out inequities in the economy.
Hughes will also finance some groups doing academic research on corporate concentration and intends to support more researchers in the future.
“If you’re going to see real change, you need a community of scholars who are in dialogue with one another,” he said.
Money is already flowing to campuses. In November, the Knight Foundation allocated $3.5 million to researchers to examine questions about digital platforms, including competition issues.
The foundation, along with Omidyar’s philanthropic network, has also provided the money to introduce an antitrust-focused initiative at Yale’s business school. In an interview, Sam Gill, a Knight executive, said the foundation had not yet taken a position on whether there should be an antimonopoly movement but felt it was important to finance inquiries into the questions posed by major tech companies.
In recent years, more potential solutions to corporate concentration have emerged. While some believe in aggressive approaches like breaking up companies, others prefer new regulations or other measures.
At a conference at the University of Utah this fall, Dan Crane, a conservative law professor, challenged a group of participants including Tim Wu, a legal scholar and New York Times contributing opinion writer who is a leading voice calling for more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Crane pushed them to be more specific about the changes they would like to see in how antitrust laws are interpreted and enforced.
Over box lunches, the group wrote a statement, later published by Wu, listing legal precedents the group hopes will be overturned and policies it hopes will be enacted.
“Those who believe in a strong revival of antitrust, and a return to its antimonopoly roots, have a duty to specify what, exactly, they mean, in concrete, legal detail,” the statement said.
Wu said that, among other purposes, the statement could be a test for judicial nominees. It’s a focus reminiscent of the playbook that helped build the conservative legal movement — which in turn shaped the antitrust laws Wu and his compatriots criticize today.
“Over a 30-year period, they won almost every one of those battles,” Wu said. “They just sort of said, ‘Here’s what it should be,’ and it happened.”

Texto completo: Jesé Milagrosa, líder espiritual de una pequeña iglesia en Bayside (Queens, NYC), ha sido acusado de agredir sexualmente a un pre adolescente en el transcurso de tres años.
Milagrosa (69), líder de la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette en la calle 204, supuestamente usó su posición en la iglesia para participar en actos sexuales con el niño de 12 años entre 2011 y 2014, informó Queens Daily Eagle.
La víctima no identificada es miembro activo de la feligresía y se enfrentó a Milagrosa con respecto al abuso en 2018.
El acusado luego admitió a los detectives que tuvo contacto oral y anal con el niño , dijeron los fiscales.
Los fiscales acusaron a Milagrosa de conducta sexual contra un menor de edad y de actos sexuales criminales. Está detenido con una fianza de $250 mil dólares y debe regresar a la corte el 20 de diciembre. Si es declarado culpable, enfrenta entre 10 años y prisión perpetua.
La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette, un templo católica fundado en el año 2000, celebra una misa tradicional en latín al menos seis días a la semana, y muchos de los feligreses son inmigrantes de América del Sur.
A raíz de su arresto, un portavoz de la Diócesis de Brooklyn, que incluye Queens, dijo que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no es una Iglesia Católica Romana y no es parte de la Diócesis de Brooklyn.
“Si bien imita muchas prácticas católicas, no es una parroquia católica romana, y no está asociada con la Diócesis de Brooklyn”, dijo el portavoz. “De hecho, la diócesis ha notificado a los fieles a lo largo de los años que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no está en comunión con la diócesis o con el Santo Padre”.
El abogado de Milagrosa, Jeffrey Pittell, dijo que él “es amado por su congregación”.
Según una entrevista en 2007 con The New York Times, “Monseñor Milagrosa” se mudó a NYC desde Venezuela en 1985, “después de crear una orden religiosa independiente, ahora con sede en Liberty, Nueva York, con la esperanza de aumentar las vocaciones entre los jóvenes hispanos”.

THE D.C. CHARADE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS HAS LACKED SUBSTANCE

Texto completo: Another chapter in the House impeachment melodrama unfolded last week. The proceedings shifted from Adam Schiff's Intelligence Committee to the Judiciary Committee, which is run by another Democratic member of Congress, Jerry Nadler of New York.
Last month, Mr. Schiff's failed approach was to bring down the president by bringing in a whole cavalcade of intelligence and foreign policy professionals and having them explain how their feelings had been hurt by the bad orange man.
Mr. Nadler tried a new approach. His strategy was to treat impeachment like a faculty meeting at Wesleyan. He produced a long line of academics with impressive-sounding credentials and had them condemn the president. And if you weren't paying close attention, you might have been impressed.
So why would we care what these people think? Apparently, we are supposed to care because of their credentials, which enable them to give a fair, balanced and informed opinion on how America ought to proceed. But is that real? Well, consider the star witness, Pam Karlan. She is the Kenneth and Harle Montgomery Professor of Public Interest Law at Stanford University. And before that, she clerked for a Supreme Court justice and earned three separate degrees at Yale. She has written several textbooks on constitutional law. If there is one impressive person in this country who our system has deemed capable of making judgments that you don't even understand, it's this lady.
But think again. Ms. Karlan is not some apolitical academic. She is a political activist who has donated thousands of dollars to Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Donating to Democrats does not prove that Ms. Karlan is wrong. She proved that herself. She made it very clear that she was incapable of wise judgments. Instead, she made bizarre claims. She claimed that delaying military aid to Ukraine was like cutting off rescue services to Americans after a hurricane. She also engaged in embarrassing political stunts like ridiculing a president's teenage son: "The Constitution says there can be no titles of nobility. So while the president can name his son Barron, he can't make him a Barron," Ms. Karlan said. Wonder how long she practiced that one in the mirror?
Ms. Karlan's fellow witnesses were almost as embarrassing. Noah Feldman, a professor at Harvard Law School, told lawmakers that he was skeptical of impeachment until this past summer. Suggesting, of course, that his endorsement is more legitimate. Turns out that was a lie. How do we know? All the way back in March 2017, the same man suggested that Mr. Trump should be impeached because of a tweet he sent accusing President Barack Obama of monitoring Trump Tower. That was impeachable, he said. He also said that James Comey's memo of his conversations with Mr. Trump was impeachment-worthy, too.
The only witness who didn't embarrass himself was George Washington Law professor Jonathan Turley. Describing Mr. Turley as a GOP witness or a right-winger or a Republican is inaccurate. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He has advocated legalizing polygamy. He wanted George W. Bush tried for war crimes. He doesn't like Mr. Trump. He didn't vote for him. But he called an absurdity where he saw one:
"My personal views of President Trump are as irrelevant to my impeachment testimony as they should be to your impeachment vote. I get it. You're mad. The president's mad. My Republican friends are mad. My Democratic friends are mad. Will a slipshod impeachment make us less mad? ... It's not wrong because President Trump is right. His call was anything but perfect. It's not wrong because the House has no legitimate reason to investigate the Ukrainian controversy. It's not wrong because we're in an election year. There is no good time for an impeachment. No. It's wrong because this is not how you impeach an American president."
Mr. Turley had it exactly right. This charade we are all witnessing in Washington is definitely not how you impeach an American president.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
Re "The End," by Andrew Keh, with photographs and additional reporting by Lynsey Addario (Special report, Dec. 8):
Thank you to Marieke Vervoort for allowing The New York Times to chronicle her journey through physician-assisted death. Until we can talk about death openly without fear, we will continue to live in a country that prioritizes quantity of days over quality of life.
Ms. Vervoort faced unenviable pain but was at least fortunate to live in a country, Belgium, that allowed her to face death on her own terms. This was excellent, heart-wrenching reporting.
Elizabeth Abbey
Spokane, Wash.
"After the date was decided, she has been very calm," Jos Vervoort said of his daughter. "She doesn't have the strength anymore to go on." (PHOTOGRAPH BY Lynsey Addario for The New York Times FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

He Spoke Up On 737 Max. Now He'll Speak Out.

Texto completo: Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at the 737 factory, believes production problems may have contributed to two deadly crashes. He will testify before Congress on Wednesday.
Four months before the first deadly crash of Boeing's 737 Max, a senior manager approached an executive at the company with concerns that the plane was riddled with production problems and potentially unsafe. That manager, Ed Pierson, plans to tell his story to Congress on Wednesday.
Employees at the Renton, Wash., factory where the Max is produced were overworked, exhausted and making mistakes, Mr. Pierson said in an interview. A cascade of damaged parts, missing tools and incomplete instructions was preventing planes from being built on time. Executives were pressuring workers to complete planes despite staff shortages and a chaotic factory floor.
"Frankly right now all my internal warning bells are going off," Mr. Pierson said in an email to the head of the 737 program in June 2018 that was reviewed by The New York Times. "And for the first time in my life, I'm sorry to say that I'm hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane."
Mr. Pierson, who is scheduled to testify at a House Transportation Committee hearing on the two 737 Max crashes, called on Boeing to shut down the Max production line last year. But the company kept producing planes and did not make major changes in response to his complaints. During the time when Mr. Pierson said the Renton facility was in disarray, it built the two planes that crashed and killed a total of 346 people.
Mr. Pierson did not raise concerns about the new automated system, known as MCAS, which caused pilots on both doomed flights to lose control. He focused on the potential safety hazards resulting from production problems.
Mr. Pierson retired in August 2018, partly because he was uncomfortable with the conditions in the 737 factory. After the first Max crash in October 2018, he took his concerns to Boeing's chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, and the company's board. Boeing lawyers, including its general counsel, spoke with Mr. Pierson about his complaints, according to Mr. Pierson and documents reviewed by The Times. But Mr. Pierson said the company did nothing in response. The Max has been grounded since March, shortly after the second deadly crash.
Now, Mr. Pierson is going public for the first time. In an interview, he expressed concern that many of the planes produced in 2018 were unsafe and that Boeing was more focused on meeting production deadlines than on safety. On Wednesday, he will join witnesses including Stephen Dickson, the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, before the House committee, which is conducting a sweeping investigation of Boeing.
His account of the disarray lends new weight to reports that Boeing rushed the 737 Max to market, and echoes claims of the shoddy production of the 787 Dreamliner at Boeing's factory in North Charleston, S.C.
Mr. Pierson believes that the production problems may have played a role in the crashes. In both accidents, MCAS was triggered when a vane installed on the plane's fuselage malfunctioned.
"It doesn't make sense that new airplanes are having these kinds of problems so early in their lives," he said.
Boeing disputed the notion of any connection between the production problems and the crashes.
"The suggestion by Mr. Pierson of a link between his concerns and the recent Max accidents is completely unfounded," a Boeing spokesman, Gordon Johndroe, said in a statement. "None of the authorities investigating these accidents have found that production conditions in the 737 factory contributed in any way to these accidents."
In the interview, Mr. Pierson also identified 13 instances, besides the crashes, in which newly produced Max jets had safety incidents, including engine shutdowns and problems with hydraulics.
"Boeing is deeply committed to encouraging its employees to raise issues -- particularly those that might involve safety or quality -- and provides several internal avenues for employees to do so," Mr. Johndroe said. "Mr. Pierson did the right thing by elevating his concerns."
Mr. Pierson described a chaotic factory that was scrambling to produce the 737 Max despite mounting problems. By early 2018, he said, Boeing had a significant backlog in its production of 737 planes. Delays became 10 times more common, he said, and fewer than 10 percent of planes were being produced on time.
Despite this, in June 2018 Boeing continued with its plan to increase its production rate to 52 planes per month from 47 per month.
Mr. Pierson and his lawyers declined to answer whether he was seeking whistle-blower protection or filing a federal whistle-blower case. He has hired a prominent whistle-blower lawyer, Eric Havian, and could stand to gain monetarily if he pursued such a case.
During this time, Mr. Pierson said, a shortage of workers, including mechanics, electricians and technicians, caused the overtime rate at the factory to more than double. Workers were completing jobs out of sequence, leading to additional mistakes. And senior executives at Boeing exacerbated the problems, he added, by berating employees about delays and urging them to work faster.
"What I witnessed firsthand, the chaos and the instability in the factory, is really unsettling to me as someone who's been around aircraft their entire life," he said.
Mr. Pierson first expressed his concerns to the head of the 737 program, Scott Campbell, in June 2018. Mr. Campbell told Mr. Pierson that the company was focused on safety, but did not acknowledge his suggestion to shut down the production line, a drastic move that would have resulted in serious delays and significant costs to the company.
When Mr. Pierson met with Mr. Campbell in July 2018, he said, he again urged Boeing to shut down the Max line. Mr. Pierson had spent decades in the Navy before joining Boeing, and said he told Mr. Campbell that he had seen the military stop exercises over less serious concerns. In response, he claims, Mr. Campbell said, "The military isn't a profit-making organization."
Mr. Pierson retired from Boeing the next month, after 10 years at the company.
Last December, after the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in October, Mr. Pierson sent a letter to Mr. Muilenburg expressing his concerns. In January and February, Mr. Pierson had several conversations with Boeing's legal team, but said the lawyers "were more interested in placating me than seriously investigating the factory conditions."
In late February, Mr. Pierson wrote a letter expressing his concerns to Boeing's board of directors. Then, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on March 10, and he never received a response from the board.
At an earlier hearing, members of the committee read an excerpt from Mr. Pierson's letter to Mr. Campbell, but did not identify him.
Mr. Pierson said he reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board to express his concerns after the second crash, but was disappointed by their responses. He said the N.T.S.B. told him that his concerns fell outside the scope of their responsibilities, that the F.A.A. appeared uninterested and that the Transportation Department never replied.
"The F.A.A. takes all whistle-blower complaints seriously," said an agency spokesman, Lynn Lunsford. "Our team has interacted on several occasions with Mr. Pierson and his attorneys about his allegations."
An N.T.S.B. spokesman, Eric Weiss, said the agency had thoroughly reviewed Mr. Pierson's information and determined that the Transportation Department's inspector general was the best office to review the claims.
Mr. Pierson is calling on the F.A.A. to investigate Boeing's factory in Renton to ensure the production problems have been corrected. He also wants the agency to instruct Boeing and airlines to inspect, and if necessary replace, the vanes that played a role in the accidents.
He worries that once the Max is flying again, Boeing -- scrambling to make up for the costly delays -- will not have changed.
"Every indication to me is that the focus to is going to shift back to pushing planes out the door," he said. "That's concerning to me."

Texto completo: BATH — The Chocolate Church Arts Center will present a special Christmas performance from the Grammy-awarded and Emmy-nominated fiddler Eileen Ivers and her ensemble of musicians at 7:30 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 22. The show, “Eileen Ivers’ A Joyful Christmas,” will mix traditional Irish songs, reinterpreted classical music and holiday tunes, and what Ivers affectionately calls “foot stomping and hollering roots music.”
Ivers, dubbed “the Jimi Hendrix of the violin” by The New York Times, is the daughter of Irish immigrants and grew up in the Bronx, where at the age of 8, she became active in the Irish traditional music scene. She went on to win nine All-Ireland fiddle championships and a 10th on tenor banjo. From there, Ivers hurtled to international stardom, performing as a founding member of the acclaimed Celtic group Cherish the Ladies, as well as with superstars like Sting, Hall and Oates and Patti Smith. Her recording credits include over 80 contemporary and traditional albums, and numerous movie scores, including Martin Scorsese’s “Gangs of New York.”
For over 20 years, Ivers and her ensemble have been celebrating the holiday season with “A Joyful Christmas.” The voices and over 20 instruments of the ensemble weave together a Celtic tradition with a contemporary sensibility, as Ivers uses a loop pedal to create unique textures with sensational virtuosity. This will be a tuneful, soulful celebration capturing the Christmas spirit and rejoicing in the magic of the holiday season.
Tickets range from $38 to $42 in advance or $47 at the door, and are available at www.chocolatechurcharts.org or by calling 207-442-8455. Tickets can also be purchased at the box office. The Chocolate Church Arts Center is at 804 Washington St.

Texto completo: The holidays are here, and for many parents, it's all about managing their kids' expectations. They think they need to give their kids the biggest presents, the most presents and the coolest presents. But trust me: Little Sally won't be scarred for life if she doesn't get a pony.
It's OK to want the best for your kids — we all do. But you should never put yourself in a financial bind to make their holiday dreams come true. That's not what Christmas is about. While other parents are shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to give their kids the "perfect" Christmas, you can teach your little ones about contentment.
Contentment isn't a money issue, even though it has a huge impact on your child's future. It's a heart issue. Content people may not have the best of everything, but they make the best of everything. Without contentment, people often try to fill the void in their hearts by cramming it full of more and more stuff. As a parent, you've got to prepare your children to defend themselves against this threat.
There's lots of research out there showing children are aware of what they have in comparison to what others have at a super-young age. Marketers fight for their attention early on, and by default, they're fighting for your money.
Make sure your kids know the newness of stuff isn't what funds their happiness or their value. Their worth goes far beyond a robo-unicorn, name-brand clothes or the iPhone 73 that everyone else has.
If you have teens, let them know if they pursue material things they're going to be a hamster on a wheel for the rest of their lives. They'll keep going around and around, always thinking the next thing is the one that will make them happy. But, of course, it won't. They'll just run in circles, wasting all their time and energy, and ultimately going nowhere. What God has in store for them is so much bigger than that.
One last reminder: Contentment isn't about age. It's about maturity. I've met 8-year-olds who get this, and 48-year-olds who don't. Your child can probably tell where your heart is regarding material wants and desires. So, be sure to give yourself a heart-check and show your child what real happiness, joy and contentment look like.
If you or your kids are struggling with contentment this season, I have a whole episode of "The Rachel Cruze Show" with advice on how to have more gratitude over the holidays. Remember, more is caught than taught. When your kids see you acting out of gratitude, it can have a huge impact on how they view things, too!

WHY THE 'WOKEST' CANDIDATES ARE THE WEAKEST MORE PRESSING CONCERNS AMONG DEMOCRATS HAVE PUSHED POLITICAL CORRECTNESS TO THE SIDE

Texto completo: Democrats are too "woke" for their own good, or so goes the argument.
"Today's progressivism is more or less a secular form of religion with its own high standards," Matt Lewis, a conservative columnist, wrote this spring. "Eventually," he concluded, "the revolution devours its own." Bill Maher, host of HBO's Real Time, urged Democratic presidential candidates to "get out of Woke-ville, for a day."
"Wokeness," in this rendering, is an overly rigid commitment to identity politics and social justice ideology. And in their zeal, these woke Democrats are pushing the Democratic Party away from the voters it needs to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.
If this were actually true, you would expect real traction for the wokest candidates in the Democratic presidential race. But it's been just the opposite. The woke candidates have been the weakest, electorally speaking, and the defining attribute of the Democratic primary has been a preoccupation with the voters that put Mr. Trump in the White House.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York centered her campaign on racial justice and the fight against sexual assault. During one debate, she identified herself as a "white woman of privilege" and promised to reach out to "white women in the suburbs who voted for Trump and explain to them what white privilege actually is." Fluent in wokeness, Ms. Gillibrand hoped to win the most progressive, social justice-minded Democrats. But she never broke away from the pack and dropped out at the end of the summer.
Beto O'Rourke, the former representative of Texas' 16th congressional district, took a similar approach, barnstorming the country as the wokest of woke Democrats.
In the wake of a shooting that killed 22 people in his hometown, El Paso, Mr. O'Rourke embraced mandatory buybacks for assault weapons, with fines for people who do not sell their weapons back to the federal government. Later, at a town hall on LGBTQ issues, Mr. O'Rourke said he would end tax-exempt status for religious institutions that opposed same-sex marriage: "There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone or any institution, any organization that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us."
Mr. O'Rourke, like Ms. Gillibrand, hoped to win the most culturally liberal Democrats. Instead, his support shrank. He dropped out at the beginning of November.
Sen. Kamala Harris of California was not as openly woke as some of her rivals - although she did voice support for reparations - but as the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, she embodied the "Great Awokening" of the Democratic electorate. If "post-Obama, the Democratic Party is increasingly the party of women and the 'woke'," as Perry Bacon Jr., a political analyst, argued in FiveThirtyEight just after she announced her campaign, then "Harris' biography and politics align well with where the party has moved."
Ms. Harris made headway - at first. But she wasn't able to capitalize on her early success. For most of the fall, she struggled to win over voters and raise money. Last week, she left the race.
None of this is dispositive. The Democratic Party might still be too woke for its own good. But the evidence for that isn't in the primary campaign. A former vice president, Joe Biden, known for his centrist politics and blue-collar affect, leads the field. His nearest rivals, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, support social justice politics, but they've centered their campaigns on inequality and corruption.
Yes, the failure of explicitly woke campaigns is a function, in part, of moderate and conservative voters in the Democratic coalition, including African Americans and Latinos. But if the Democratic Party is as woke as critics say, the race should be able to sustain one or two woke candidates. The fact that it can't should undermine, or at least temper, the idea of a "Great Awokening" transforming Democratic politics. At the very least, it shows that Democrats are far more concerned with beating Mr. Trump than elevating woke ideology.
With all of that said, I want to make a point about the term "woke" itself. These days, it's a term of abuse - a shorthand for puritanical political correctness, a pejorative wielded against liberal elitism. But its origins are in African American vernacular, where it referred to a broad awareness of anti-black oppression. The metaphor of being "awake," for example, drives Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 speech "Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution." Like so much other black slang, it's been borrowed and diluted and worn down, so that the original meaning has faded from view. That meaning, however, is still worthwhile.
Puritanism is not useful for politics or governing. But a broad awareness of oppression - of the ways this country does not work for many of its citizens - is vital. To the extent that Democrats have that awareness, they should not shy away from it.

Hair dyes, straighteners may raise breast cancer risks for Black women

Texto completo: For decades, scientists have debated whether hair dyes frequently used by women might contribute to cancer. The research has been mixed and inconclusive, but now government investigators have turned up a disturbing new possibility.
Black women who regularly used permanent dyes to color their hair were 60% more likely to develop breast cancer, compared to Black women who did not report using dye, according to an analysis published this week in The International Journal of Cancer.
White women using hair dye did not see a significantly increased risk. The reasons are unclear: It may be because different products are designed for women of different ethnic and racial backgrounds, or that variations in hair texture alter the amounts of dye that are applied or absorbed through the skin.
The study also implicated hair straighteners, finding a 30% increase in the risk of breast cancer among women of all races who reported regular use of the products. African-American women were much more likely than white women to use hair straighteners, the researchers noted.
The analysis does not prove hair treatments cause breast cancer, several experts said, and the overall risk for African-American women is difficult to know. Fewer than 10% of the study's participants were Black women, their use of hair products was assessed only once, and they were tracked for just eight years on average.
Generally, scientists become concerned when an environmental exposure doubles or triples cancer risk, meaning the relative risk rises by 100% or more. The figures reported in the new study fall short of that threshold.
"You cannot, based on these data, make the statement that hair dyes and straighteners cause breast cancer," said Dr. Larry Norton, medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. "These effects were small."
Still, some scientists said the findings were concerning because of how popular hair products are. In the study, more than half said they had used hair dye, and nearly three-quarters of Black women reported using hair straighteners.
"Our advice is that if you want to take a cautionary approach, limiting the use of these types of products is warranted," said Robin Dodson, a research scientist at the Silent Spring Institute in Newton, Massachusetts, who studies environmental risks to women's health.
She has identified several chemicals that mimic the hormone estrogen in hair straighteners used by Black women, including parabens, commonly used as a preservative, and some banned by the European Union. Estrogen can fuel some types of breast cancer.
"Most products put out there on the market today are not adequately tested for safety, and they aren't tested for endocrine-disrupting chemicals," Dodson said, referring to additives that interfere with hormones in the body.
"Most people are very surprised to learn that there's nobody really minding the store."
The new study, carried out by scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, part of the NIH, relied on data from 46,709 women in the so-called Sister Study.
Participants were between the ages of 35 and 74 and living in the United States from 2003 to 2009. None had breast cancer at the start of the study, but all had at least one sister who had breast cancer - meaning that subjects, too, were at elevated risk.
The women were asked about their use of hair treatments when they first enrolled in the study. They were followed over an average of eight years, during which 2,794 breast cancers were diagnosed.
"The take-home message is that these risks are potentially important, but we know that a lot of different factors contribute to a woman's risk of breast cancer," said Alexandra White, head of the environment and cancer epidemiology group at the NIEHS and an author of the new report.
"We want women to have this information and take it into account in their lifestyle decisions, but to keep in mind that the risks associated with these are small," she added.
Only 4,087 of the participants in the study were Black women, about 9%, she noted, and that number may be too small to know whether the risks are real.
"These findings are definitely more concerning for Black women because of the findings on permanent dye and their more frequent use of chemical straighteners," White said. Many straighteners contain formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.
White suggested that women switch from permanent dyes to semi-permanent dyes, which were not found to be associated with an increase in cancer.

Tweets, tariffs, twaddle and you

Texto completo: No major American daily newspaper features sharper pens than the market-focused writers at the Wall Street Journal. When these opinion peddlers go after you in print, they hit hard, fast, and - most of the time - with inarguable fact.
Witness the Journal's lead editorial Dec. 3, titled "Mount Tariff Erupts Again," a full-frontal assault on President Donald J. Trump's day-before tweets in which he imposed new steel tariffs on two of American agriculture's biggest export competitors - and now China's growing ag suppliers - Brazil and Argentina.
"It's hard to know exactly what motivated Mr. Trump's tweets," wondered the editorialists, "... but he seems to think he can use tariffs as a two-fer to help struggling U.S. steel makers while punishing Argentina and Brazil for displacing U.S. farm exports to China."
That's not how markets - or even White Houses - work, the Journal reminded readers. In fact, "He's wrong on every count."
That unmistakable poke arrived just as the president was, yet again, repositioning his ever-shifting position on a much-awaited U.S.-China trade deal. Well, Mr. Trump opined from Europe, "In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal."
Yes, that election, Nov. 3, 2020, a full growing season from now.
So where does all this presidential tweaking, tweeting and, according to the Journal, twaddle, leave U.S. farmers and ranchers, Chinese buyers and the U.S. economy?
One unlikely comparison captures the essence of the president's tariff policy and, as he calls it, the "fake news" media, especially his hometown newspaper, the New York Times.
First, predictably, U.S. steel tariffs have hit U.S. steel makers harder than foreign steel exporters. As the Journal noted, U.S. steel prices "have plunged by nearly half since June 2018" and "(p)rimary metal manufacturing jobs have fallen by 7,900 since [this] January..."
These facts are confirmed in the stock price of U.S. Steel, the nation's second-largest steel maker. After more than a year of market-guarding tariffs, U.S. Steel shares now hover at $13, up from a 2019 low of $10.14 in mid-October but still 30% below the Jan. 2 price of $18.51.
Clearly, protective steel tariffs have bloodied, not boosted, the American steel sector.
As such, why impose the same, wrong-headed policies now on Argentina-a nation that, according the Journal, "makes up less than 1% of U.S. steel imports" - and Brazil, a key ag export competitor?
That wrongness will be amplified by the President's "wait-until-the-election" plan on any China trade deal. Indeed, in less than 24 hours the White House somehow found the best worst way to ensure that China, Argentina, and Brazil become even better trading buddies next year while U.S. farmers and ranchers see more of their markets simply handed over to competitors.
And that's if Mount Tariff doesn't blow again. If it does, the Chinese-Argentine-Brazilian ag trade triangle could become even more set in concrete.
But don't take it from me; take it from the nation's leading business newspaper, the Wall Street Journal, the flagship of Rupert Murdoch's American media empire that includes Fox News.
Oh, I nearly forgot, the aforementioned "fake news" comparison: As the U.S. steel industry was losing jobs, markets and value under the tariff regime imposed by the president, one of his toughest media critics, the "fake news" New York Times, was killing it in the market.
On Jan. 2, 2019, the Times' share price was $21.85; its year-to-date high, $35.68 per share, was hit on July 31. Its Dec. 3 price was $31.29, up - so far - in 2019 a whopping 43%.
That, too, is an irrefutable market reality; investors pay for solid value, not molten lava. Just ask the miners at the Wall Street Journal.

Resumen: Massie thought the film superficial but took advantage of the publicity to raise money for hemophilia treatment. * Actor Ron Leibman, who appeared in movies, theater and television in a career that spanned six decades and won a Tony Award for portraying Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner’s iconic play "Angels in America," died of pneumonia Friday. Mark Butler was spending time with his family over the Thanksgiving weekend, and the cause of death was later determined to be atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. * A Washington lawyer and legal scholar who helped pioneer the practice of suing foreign governments in U.S. courts for complicity in terrorism, representing victims’ families in the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, died Dec. 1 at his home in the District of Columbia. Gerson was an author, private-practice lawyer, former professor at George Mason University and deputy assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, known for representing victims of human rights abuses and terrorist attacks.

Texto completo: * A Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who specialized in best-selling and critically praised biographies of the Russian czars — and who discovered a personal connection to the country’s past through the blood disorder that afflicted both his son and the son of Nicholas II — died at his Irvington, New York, home Monday at age 90. Robert K. Massie had been suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
Likened to David McCullough and Edmund Morris as a popularizer of history, Robert K. Massie wrote epic page turners on two outsized czars: the 900-page "Peter the Great," winner of the Pulitzer in 1981, and the 600-page "Catherine the Great," winner in 2012 of a PEN award for biography.
Massie’s first book drew upon his interest in Nicholas’ heir apparent, the Tsarevich Alexei, a hemophiliac like the eldest of Massie’s three children, Robert Jr., who was born in 1990. "Nicholas and Alexandra" was published in 1967, in the midst of the Cold War, and praised in The New York Times as a long-needed and balanced account of the last czar and his family. Massie’s book also was a commercial success and the basis for a 1971 film adaptation, starring Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman, that won the Oscar for art direction. Massie thought the film superficial but took advantage of the publicity to raise money for hemophilia treatment.
* Actor Ron Leibman, who appeared in movies, theater and television in a career that spanned six decades and won a Tony Award for portraying Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner’s iconic play "Angels in America," died of pneumonia Friday. He was 82.
Leibman, who was married to actress Jessica Walter, played a huge variety of roles both dramatic and comic. He appeared in numerous films including "Norma Rae," opposite Sally Field, and "Slaughterhouse-Five." He won an Emmy award in 1979 for the short-lived CBS series "Kaz," which he also created. He was perhaps best known on television for his role on "Friends," though, in which he played Dr. Leonard Green, the father of Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston.
* Leonard Goldberg, a network and studio executive and producer whose TV credits ranged from "Starsky and Hutch" in the 1970s to the current drama series "Blue Bloods" and whose independent movies included "WarGames" and "Sleeping with the Enemy," died at a Los Angeles hospital Wednesday of injuries he suffered in a fall. He was 85.
* D.C. Fontana, a writer and story editor for the original "Star Trek" television series and later a contributor to "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and other related projects, died Tuesday after a brief illness. She was 80.
* The co-founder and CEO of Ollie’s Bargain Outlet died unexpectedly Dec. 1 at the age of 61. Mark Butler was spending time with his family over the Thanksgiving weekend, and the cause of death was later determined to be atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
* A Washington lawyer and legal scholar who helped pioneer the practice of suing foreign governments in U.S. courts for complicity in terrorism, representing victims’ families in the aftermath of the Lockerbie bombing and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, died Dec. 1 at his home in the District of Columbia. Allan Gerson was 74.
The cause was complications of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain disorder, said his wife, cookbook author Joan Nathan.
Gerson was an author, private-practice lawyer, former professor at George Mason University and deputy assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, known for representing victims of human rights abuses and terrorist attacks. He also distinguished himself as a photographer, with work collected at the International Photography Hall of Fame Museum in St. Louis, and as a jewelry designer who turned some of his images into brooches.
* The actress who in her 50-year career was best known for playing a memorable maid on "Will & Grace" died of heart failure Dec. 1 at a Los Angeles hospital. Shelley Morrison was 83.
Morrison played Rosario Salazar, a maid from El Salvador, in the original run of "Will & Grace" from 1999 to 2006, becoming part of a cast that won a Screen Actors Guild award for best ensemble in a comedy series.
The character, originally written for a single episode, proved so popular in her interactions with co-star Megan Mullally that she would appear in 68 episodes during the NBC series’ original eight-season run.
"Rosario is one of my all-time favorite characters," Morrison said recently, according to a statement and biography announcing her death. "She reminds me a lot of my own mother, who loved animals and children, but she would not suffer fools. It is very significant to me that we were able to show an older, Hispanic woman who is bright and smart and can hold her own."
* Pat Sullivan, the 1971 Heisman Trophy winner at Auburn who went on coach TCU and Samford, died Dec. 1 after a 15-year battle with throat cancer. He was 69.
* Mariss Jansons, conductor of top classical ensembles including the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam, died Nov. 30 in Russia. He was 76.
* The half-Barbadian, New York-born songwriter who adapted a traditional Jamaican call-and-response tune and helped launch a calypso craze around the world died Nov. 29 of complications of a heart ailment. Irving Burgie, who wrote the 1956 Harry Belafonte hit "Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)," was 95.
Burgie also sang under the stage name Lord Burgess, penned a well-received off-Broadway musical and wrote the lyrics to Barbados’ national anthem.
"Calypso," the Belafonte record that "Day-O" opened, spent 31 weeks atop the Billboard charts, outsold two Elvis Presley albums and is generally considered the first million-selling record by a single artist in the United States. Burgie is credited on eight of its 11 songs.
* Dorcas R. Hardy, who rose through President Ronald Reagan’s political circle to become the first female administrator of Social Security, a role in which she sounded an early alarm about the entitlement program’s projected shortfalls as baby boomers approached retirement, died Nov. 28 at her home in Spotsylvania, Virginia. She was 73 and had small vessel disease of the brain.
* A pioneer of LGBTQ comics who served as the founding editor of Gay Comix, one of the first series to feature work by and for openly gay men and women, and who later published "Stuck Rubber Baby," an acclaimed graphic novel inspired by his early years in Jim Crow-era Alabama, died of complications from lymphoma Nov. 26 at a hospital in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Howard Cruse was 75.

Texto completo: For too long, "kitchen gifts" have referred to kitschy, single-use products (think novelty aprons, egg cookers) that are more likely to get stuck inside some drawer than proudly displayed and used day after day. Even the most well-intentioned gift givers tend to draw a blank when it comes to the kitchen and succumb to the lure of plastic gadgets and funny mugs. Luckily, it doesn't have to be that way. To help you gift smarter and better, we've rounded up the best kitchen gifts of the year that people actually want and love. Whether you're shopping for an experienced chef or someone who uses their oven to store clothes, we've got you covered. These are the best kitchen gifts of 2019, according to Reviewed:
For the one who wants an air fryer: Philips Airfryer XXL Air fryers were the hottest kitchen gadgets (literally) again in 2019, and they're popping up all over wish lists this holiday season. With so many on the market, it can be hard to tell them all apart—that's why we tested over 20 of the best air fryers to see which are actually worth buying. The Philips Airfryer XXL easily claimed the top spot, churning out massive batches of crisp french fries, crackling fried chicken, and perfectly cooked burgers with ease. If your giftee can't decide between an air fryer and an Instant Pot, the other trendiest gadget on shelves this year, we recommend checking out the Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker that can sear, bake, pressure cook, air fry, and more.
Get the Philips Airfryer XXL on Amazon for $299.95
For the one who doesn't want an air fryer: Breville Smart Oven Pro While the idea of an air fryer might sound nice, not everyone can afford that extra countertop space. For those cooks who prefer sleek minimalism, the Breville Smart Oven Pro is the appliance of their dreams. It scored top marks in our toaster oven roundup, but it's so much more than a toaster oven. It can bake, broil, and roast as well as a full-size oven, and its convection bake setting yields crispy results like an air fryer. If you didn't know that an air fryer is just a small convection oven, now you know—now share that with your loved ones and get gifting.
Get the Breville Smart Oven Pro on Amazon for $269.99
For the wannabe 'Bake Off' contestant: KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer The KitchenAid brand is synonymous with "stand mixer" for a reason—their timeless, high-performing mixers are simply better than the competition. The 5-quart Artisan stand mixer remains No. 1 in our roundup of the best stand mixers on the market thanks to its powerful, quiet motor and user-friendly design. Hobby bakers and professionals alike adore this model, which has almost 7,000 5-star reviews on Amazon. Oh, and it comes in 20 stunning colors—but if you're not sure what color your giftee would love, you can never go wrong with Empire Red.

For the one who wants an Instant Pot: Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 For busy home cooks who don't already have a pressure cooker, you can never go wrong with an Instant Pot. The incredibly popular family of multicookers still has everyone buzzing—but there are too many models to tell apart! If you don't know where to start, we recommend the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1, which took first place in our roundup of the best multicookers and offers the most valuable options for the money. It's sleek interface and convenient controls will have your giftee thanking you again and again.

For the cook who needs to feed a crowd: Staub Cast Iron 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte A classic, well-designed Dutch oven is a great gift for just about anyone, but they're handy for people who tend to cook a lot of food at once. You might assume that Le Creuset has this category on lock, but the best Dutch oven from our testing is the 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte from French competitor Staub, a sleek, stylish, and versatile vessel for cooking just about anything. If you're put off by the price tag on the Staub, we recommend the Lodge 4.5-Quart Round Dutch Oven, our top budget pick.
Get the Staub Cast Iron 5.5-Quart Round Cocotte on Amazon for $339.95
For the beginner in need of knives: Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic Knife Block Set Experienced chefs might find the number of knives in a knife block excessive, but for beginners and households with multiple cooks, a block is essential. We tested the best knife sets on the market and found the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Classic Knife Block to be the most comprehensive set with the sharpest blades—very giftable.
Get the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Gourmet Knife Set on Williams-Sonoma for $349.95
For the classic style icon: Baker Stripe Dish Towels Dish towels can (and should) be a lot more than some rags you keep around to your kitchen. With their colorful pinstripes and high-quality knit fabric, these stylish dish towels evoke thoughts of French patisserie windows and dreamy summer fantasies of a simpler life. OK, and they're soft and absorbent and highly rated on Anthropologie. If you're just looking for clean white towels or even simpler designs, check out our roundup of the best dish towels for some great options.
Get the Baker Stripe Dish Towels, Set of 4 from Anthropologie for $20
For the talented chef: 'How to Cook Everything' by Mark Bittman Cookbook collectors can be hard to shop for, but there's a good chance they don't already have the 20th anniversary edition of How to Cook Everything from Mark Bittman of the New York Times. Released this month, this edition expands on his excellent recipes and deep explainers on all-things cooking. This is a tomb with something to teach novices and experienced chefs alike. Looking for something easier to digest? Celebrity chef Samin Nosrat's "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat," the book that launched her hit Netflix show, is a colorful and eye-opening guide to mastering the elements of cooking. "Just reading Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat will make you a better cook, adept at seasoning, balancing, and understanding what it really is you're doing and why," writes Bon Appétit.
Get "How to Cook Everything—Completely Revised Twentieth Anniversary Edition: Simple Recipes for Great Food" by Mark Bittman on Amazon for $22.20
For the family who hosts pizza night: Lodge Cast Iron Pizza Pan Pizza is always a crowd-pleaser, and so is this multi-purpose pizza pan from Lodge. It snagged first place in our roundup of the best pizza stones for its portability, affordability, and heat retention, and it can easily be used in an oven or on a grill. And because it's essentially just a massive cast iron pan, it's also great for preparing roast veggies and other dishes all year round. Hello, pizza night. If sky's the limit on your budget and you really want to wow someone with the ultimate pizza gift, this miniature pizza oven from Breville is the best of the best. We tested it with an actual pizza chef and he was wildly impressed with how evenly and quickly it could churn out some delicious Neapolitan pizzas. We've even seen it used in the Bon Appétit test kitchen, so you know it's the real deal.

Protection of predators: A corporate culture

Texto completo: Ronan Farrow's "Catch and Kill" (Little Brown) explores corporate culture concealing well-known predators from the consequences of their actions, as winsome women were "thrown under the bus" to protect powerful presences in news and entertainment. Farrow's exposé might be the 2019 Book of the Year.
Rosanna Arquette, who alleges assault by Harvey Weinstein in the early 1990s, assessed the systemic seediness as being "a cabal that was deeper and wider than Weinstein. 'This is the big boys' club, the Hollywood mafia.... They protect each other.'" Millions were spent as hush money to buy victims' silence. Prominent law firm Bois Schiller reaped huge profits to kill coverage by The New York Times while, simultaneously, representing the paper.
NBC Universal, Farrow claims, killed reporting on Weinstein because of his threats — part of supposedly widespread intimidation of parties to camouflage his deviancy — to expose misbehavior at NBC for which the television network entered nondisclosure agreements to silence victims.
NBC News Chairman Andy Lack is no stranger to Mississippi, being involved with the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics at Ole Miss and Mississippi Today. Weinstein was apparently in regular communication with Lack, and Lack had no shortage of internal exposure, given that NBC's morning news poster boy, Matt Lauer, is allegedly a variation on a theme of Weinstein: "Bottom line, it's trouble that the president of NBC News is talking directly with Harvey and lying... about it."
Lack is said to have "pursued sexual relationships with underlings and talent.... Lack was 'almost unrelenting.'" One executive stated of a corporate culture at NBC fostering predation, "The reason that you have these cultural problems — he created that!"
Lack and Lauer are not the only men accused of misbehavior at NBC News: Tom Brokaw, David Corvo, Mark Halperin, and Chris Matthews are also named in "Catch and Kill":
"Six, and then twelve, and then dozens of current and former employees gave me a similar account of a permissive atmosphere when it came to harassment by prominent men at the network. Several of the employees said that they believed the years-long pattern of settlements had allowed the behavior to continue. Some said that the problems deepened under Andy Lack's leadership. When Lack began his first tenure as president of NBC News, in the nineties, 'it was a fundamental shift of, all of a sudden, a tolerance for abusive behavior, whether it was sexually harassing or it was just verbally abusive,' Linda Vester, who raised the first complaint about Brokaw, told me. 'Degrading, humiliating talk, mainly to women. And that became the climate under Andy Lack. It was just — it was very stark.'"
The news and entertainment industry has been seen as a hotbed of sin and inquiry since the Fatty Arbuckle scandal, almost 100 years ago. I cannot speak sanctimoniously: Comcast — which owns NBCUniversal — Founder Ralph Roberts' widow Suzanne Roberts shared first-cousins with three branches of my Alabama family. Comcast's senior executive vice president is the brother-in-law of my younger sister.
Ole Miss faces a bigger conundrum: Given problems with fraternity boys vandalizing the Emmett Till Memorial and the unseemly selection of a new chancellor, Ole Miss needs no questions raised about its journalism school. "Catch and Kill" examines whether the purpose of the Fourth Estate is to protect powerful interests or ferret out truth and promote the public interest.

What will be the word of decade? Fake news. App. Hashtag - group will have last say

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest? No.
Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
Words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against inequality.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, said Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.

Texto completo: Dr. Jen Gunter has two New York Times columns dedicated to women's health, a Canadian docuseries called "Jensplaining" and a very active social media presence where she disseminates medical fallacies in a way that the general public can understand. Her latest project is the book "The Vagina Bible: The Vulva and the Vagina: Separating the Myth from the Medicine" (Citadel, $18.95) -- a Publishers Weekly and New York Times bestseller.
Born and raised in Winnipeg, Canada, the obstetrician and gynecologist resides with her sons in Northern California. An edited version of our conversation follows.
Q: You're famous for all the information you share about women's health, but let's be real. Your shoe collection is famous too. Where do you buy them?
A: (Laughs) Oh yeah, I have a thing for shoes. I wear a lot of Fluevogs. These are the shoes I purchase the most because they're so comfortable. I have a huge shoe cabinet in my bedroom where I display my most beautiful shoes like artwork. I grew up with size 10 1/2 feet and no stores carried bigger than a 10. My whole life I wore shoes that were too small and painful or just really ugly, so I think that's why shoes are such a thing for me.
Q: You do a lot of writing that you share with the public. Do you write when you're on the road?
A: I actually do. I don't use public Wi-Fi ever, especially in places like airports. So I write a lot on planes and at airports, because I won't be distracted by being online. I can usually sit somewhere and tune everything out. I recently flew to Chicago and worked three hours solid on the way there and back. Writing makes the trip go faster.
Q: What was the first trip you took as a child?
A: My parents emigrated from England and we went back there every few years. The first trip I remember would've been around kindergarten time. It was such a big deal to fly in the early '70s. You dressed up and had to behave. The flight attendants gave you things like wings and little books for kids to fill out.
Q: Given the choice, would you eat at a street cart or fine restaurant?
A: There are people who have street carts who are making amazing food, but I like the experience of going in and sitting down to a great meal and I want my kids to have that experience. I cook at home mostly and we only go out to eat every four or five months, but when we do, it's to a really nice place like a Michelin-starred restaurant as a treat.
Q: Where are your favorite weekend getaways?
A: We don't really go away for the weekends. My kids do, because they'll do that with their dad. But when they travel with me, it's usually on longer trips to see family in Canada or England. But once we get there, we will take overnight trips to another city. It's so much fun as a tourist to take the train.
Q: What would be your dream trip?
A: I'm desperate to go to Greece. I grew up obsessed with Greek mythology. I want to see the Parthenon and Acropolis and all the things I had read about. I also love Greek food!
Q: What are some of your favorite cities?
A: I love Cardiff in Wales. Welsh people are so awesome, but I'm kind of biased because my dad's family is originally from Wales. It's cool to have a castle right in the city that you can walk right up to. It's not crowded or crazy. They have a beautiful art museum in Cardiff and you walk in and there's no crowd.
I also like New York. When I took my kids the first time, they were unprepared for the volume of people on the street. They were a little freaked out. They'd been to Toronto and London, but London's not as dense as New York. It's a big city, but everybody's so nice and the food is great.

Texto completo: Don't mess with us, man.
WASHINGTON -- When people ask me about my work, or comment on it, there is one word that always makes me bristle.
"Hate."
When I wrote about George W. Bush relying on souped-up intelligence to invade Iraq, people would ask, "Why do you hate W.?"
When I wrote about how Barack Obama was hampered as president by his disdain for politicking, people would ask, "Why do you hate Obama?"
When I wrote about Hillary Clinton's flaws as a candidate, people would ask, "Why do you hate Hillary?"
I hid my irritation by making a joke: "I don't hate politicians. I save strong emotions like that for my ex-boyfriends."
But I've thought about the word "hate" a lot. Not, as Nancy Pelosi said, in relation to being Catholic. But in relation to being a woman.
The reason it upset me was that it seemed like a way to undercut legitimate concerns I had about the behavior of a president or would-be president by suggesting that strong emotions were clouding my judgment. It's not that they are doing something wrong; it's that you are an overwrought female.
It evoked the old trope that women are vengeful and hysterical -- a word derived from the Greek word for womb. (This is the same sexist trope Donald Trump played into when he rebutted my criticisms of him during the 2016 campaign by tweeting that I was "wacky" and "neurotic.")
So I understood why reporter James Rosen got under the speaker's skin when he asked if her declaration that the House would draw up impeachment articles was inspired by the irrational rather than the rational.
She wore white but she saw red.
When Rosen asked, "Do you hate the president, Madam Speaker?" Pelosi wagged her finger and retorted, "I don't hate anybody."
With more to say, she strode back to the microphones: "As a Catholic, I resent your using the word 'hate' in a sentence that addresses me. I don't hate anyone. I was raised in a way that is a heart full of love and always pray for the president." Before walking off, she delivered the coup de grâce to a chastened Rosen: "So don't mess with me when it comes to words like that."
Within the hour, the president had predictably tweet-trashed her, saying she had "a nervous fit," returning to the threadbare canard of women as hysterics. He said he did not believe that Pelosi prayed for him.
But she does. I talked to her about it in August, when she was still keeping impeachment at bay, after we visited the chapel at Trinity, where she went to college.
She said that she prays for the president at night in her apartment in Georgetown and in church on Sunday. "The prayer," she said, "is that God will open his heart to meet the needs of the American people."
She said that she even complained to her pastor that her prayers were not working.
"Maybe you're not praying hard enough," the priest replied.
The last week was a tale of three tantrums: one justified, one unjustified and one just what we expect.
Pelosi's upbraiding was effective because it wasn't someone whining or feeling sorry for herself. It was someone laying down the law -- without worrying that a man would label her a virago or harridan or termagant. Nervous Nancy? Hardly. She was more like John Wayne, minus the racism and colonialism.
In Iowa, meanwhile, surly Joe Biden erupted at an 83-year-old retired farmer who brought up Hunter Biden's nepotistic payday from a Ukrainian energy company. The farmer had his facts twisted, mistakenly claiming that Biden had "sent" his son to work in Ukraine to sell "access" to the president.
Biden's friend John McCain had a blazing temper, but he set the template for how to handle an older Midwestern voter who has the facts bollixed up -- firmly but politely.
Biden's outburst -- "You're a damn liar, man," he snapped -- showed that he still thinks any questions about his son's windfalls while he was vice president are out of line -- even though Hunter himself has acknowledged using "poor judgment."
It also showed that he has no answer for something that's bound to be a big part of the general campaign, since it is at the heart of the crazy Rudy-Donny conspiracy theory that provoked the impeachment drive. If Joe Biden can't handle an 83-year-old retired farmer without losing his cool, how can he handle a 73-year-old piranha?
Withholding $ 400 million in military aid to a fledging democracy under attack from Russia is in a different universe than making a quick buck off the Washington influence machine. But that farmer is not the only voter who feels a little queasy about Joe Biden not stopping Hunter from making a money grab in Ukraine while the vice president was pushing the Ukrainians to be less corrupt.
President Trump's trans-Atlantic pout after learning that the other world leaders were caught on tape mocking him as prolix was typical but still pathetic.
He brings to mind the paradox of Cassandra. Her gift was that she could see into the future, but her curse was that no one believed her. Trump's triumph is that he has sought attention his whole life and now he can command all the attention in the world. But his curse is that the attention he attracts is largely ridicule and repulsion.
Fortunately for the president, one person in Washington is praying for him.

The McKinsey controversy — and the fallout

Texto completo: MCKINSEY & COMPANY, the elite management consulting firm, likes to keep a tight lid on its projects.
The discretion is, in part, about protecting its clients — some of the largest companies and mightiest governments in the world. But the firm also has to worry about its own reputation; McKinsey doesn't want to be known for doing ethically dubious errands for the powerful.
Lately however, some of the company's most sensitive work has won unwanted attention. A lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey showed how it advised Purdue Pharma on boosting sales of Oxycontin and tamping down bad publicity around opioid overdoses. McKinsey's consulting for authoritarian regimes in China and Saudi Arabia has drawn scrutiny. And the firm has been implicated in a huge scandal involving a South African energy company that led to the resignation of the country's former president, Jacob Zuma.
Last week, the New York Times and ProPublica, the non-profit investigative journalism outfit, co-published a piece detailing McKinsey's work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement — helping the federal agency execute President Trump's controversial crackdown on illegal immigration and recommending that the agency spend less on food and medical care for migrants who have been detained.
Here, in the first installment of a new Ideas feature explaining and contextualizing recent news that you may have missed: a look at the latest McKinsey controversy.
What did the New York Times/ProPublica investigation find?
McKinsey, first hired by the Obama administration to help with an “organizational transformation" of an ICE division, quickly pivoted to work on Trump's immigration clampdown. The firm's cost-cutting proposals — including reduced spending on food and medical care for migrants — made some career ICE employees uncomfortable.
“The consultants, three people who worked on the project said, seemed focused solely on cutting costs and speeding up deportations — actions whose success could be measured in numbers — with little acknowledgment that these policies affected thousands of human beings," the Times and ProPublica reported.
The firm also worked with ICE to speed up the recruitment and hiring of immigration officers. Attempts to do so by previous administrations “ended badly," the Times and ProPublica reported, resulting in “lax hiring standards" and “a subsequent spike in misconduct and corruption cases among Border Patrol officers." Ultimately, budget constraints meant ICE hired only a fraction of the 10,000 new officers the president called for. And some of the McKinsey proposals that career ICE employees found most objectionable — like cutting spending on food and medicine — were never put into effect.
McKinsey has pushed back on the Times and ProPublica report, arguing that its efforts to speed up hiring and win lower prices for vendor services like health care was just a continuation of its work under Obama.
“As a firm," McKinsey said, in a statement after the article was published, “we are committed to supporting the United States' legacy of welcoming immigrants."
What's the fallout?
McKinsey's work with ICE ended in July 2018, after an earlier Times report called attention to the contract. But shortly thereafter, the firm signed a contract with another federal agency involved in Trump's immigration crackdown, Customs and Border Protection — inviting more of the scrutiny McKinsey so likes to avoid.
The bad press — on the ICE contract and previous work — is becoming something of a problem for Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic presidential hopeful who worked for the firm from June 2007 to March 2010. McKinsey was working for Purdue Pharma, one of the biggest drivers of the opioid epidemic, during that period. Buttigieg says he was unaware of that work at the time.
He's made some oblique references to his own endeavors at McKinsey — saying he examined grocery pricing and traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq. But he says he's unable to talk about his assignments in detail because of a non-disclosure agreement. His campaign says it has contacted McKinsey to explore whether he might be released from it.
But the New York Times editorial board and other critics have argued he needs to do more to shed light on his McKinsey tenure.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said. "This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession. The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College / New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017. His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18. Tickets are available online at www.donaldjtrump.com/events/battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

THE NATION; Mum's the word on one Buttigieg chapter; Presidential candidate has a nondisclosure agreement from his time with McKinsey.

Texto completo: By presidential campaign standards, Pete Buttigieg has been pretty much an open book -- but with one chapter missing.
The Democratic South Bend, Ind., mayor has let reporters sit on his campaign bus and pelt him with questions until they get tired; he's spoken at length about his personal experience coming out as a gay man; he's shown a willingness to face some of his most withering critics.
But Buttigieg won't talk about his three years of work for McKinsey & Co., the famous -- and lately, controversial -- management consulting firm.

Almost a decade after leaving McKinsey in 2010, Buttigieg is still bound by a nondisclosure agreement that his campaign says McKinsey is refusing to lift, leaving a large hole in the 37-year-old's otherwise closely examined life story.
"We have asked McKinsey to be released from the NDA in full, and we have asked McKinsey if we can release a list of clients," campaign spokesman Sean Savett said. "To date, they have not agreed. We will continue to ask and are eager to share more about his work as soon as we are able."
Buttigieg told NBC News on Thursday: "Look, I keep my word and I signed a legal document. When you serve a client ... you're going to respect their confidentiality. But I do think it would be a good thing for that to be released."
Buttigieg's legal vow of secrecy -- coupled with McKinsey's silence when asked for comment -- is an increasingly common collision of the growing use of nondisclosure agreements in the private sector with the public's expectation of transparency from candidates seeking higher office.
"We're seeing it become an issue, and it's likely going to become more of an issue over time," said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a liberal advocacy group that pushes to limit corporate influence in politics. "Buttigieg's professional career doesn't go back that far, and this is an important part of it, and absolutely American people have a right to know what he was doing and what was going on if he's going to be a serious contender for the presidency."
In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was bound by a confidentiality agreement from disclosing the underlying investors of Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded that was notorious for cutting costs.
Bain's work has come up again in this election after fellow Bain alumnus and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick announced his entry into the Democratic race. His campaign did not respond to inquiries about whether he had signed a similar agreement.
The most notorious use of a confidentiality agreement came in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. Then-candidate Donald Trump allegedly directed his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to pay off porn performer Stormy Daniels in return for a nondisclosure agreement over her allegations of an affair with Trump in 2006.
The payoff was later deemed an illegal unreported campaign contri- bution.
In Buttigieg's case, corporate secrecy is likely to win out, legal experts say.
"There is a legitimate business motive for enforcing an NDA here," said Wilson Huhn, a professor of law at Duquesne University who has been critical of these secret contracts. "But yeah, when the person's running for president, I would certainly stand with the journalists and with the citizenry and say we really have to have all of the relevant information about somebody."
Nondisclosure agreements have come under growing criticism in recent years for their use in concealing sexual-abuse settlements. But imposing them to conceal proprietary information from competitors, as McKinsey does, has largely avoided criticism.
A politician running for president who cannot speak about three years of his life is an exception.
"That's the problem with nondisclosure agreements," said Mark Fenster, a University of Florida law professor. "When they become overly broad, their very existence becomes a problem."
Companies often use consultant firms such as McKinsey to help find inefficiencies and cut costs, which can bring profits for shareholders while raining woe on employees.
"One of the cardinal virtues within McKinsey is confidentiality," a former McKinsey associate, Ethan M. Rasiel, wrote in a 1999 book called "The McKinsey Way." "The Firm guards its secrets closely. I, along with every other former McKinsey-ite, agreed never to disclose confidential information about the Firm and its clients, even after leaving McKinsey." Clients are also reportedly bound by these agreements.
Buttigieg was hired at the firm's Chicago office in 2007, fresh off his Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford.
In his memoir, Buttigieg hints at projects that included studying prices for a Canadian grocer, "energy efficiency research" and "war-zone economic development work to help grow private sector employment in Iraq and Afghanistan."
McKinsey has recently faced criticism for advising opioid manufacturers how to boost sales and working with authoritarian governments in China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
This week, the New York Times and ProPublica reported that McKinsey consultants working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement proposed "detention savings opportunities," including cuts in food and medical care for detainees, that made ICE officials uncomfortable.
That led four immigration activist groups on Thursday to demand Buttigieg "immediately return" his donations from McKinsey employees, who contribute to the two-term mayor's campaign more than any other Democratic presidential candidate.
Buttigieg's campaign declined to return the money but said it had taken steps to prevent future donations from McKinsey consultants who were specifically involved in the ICE project.
"We have combed through thousands of pages of documents that ProPublica obtained to ensure that we had never accepted a donation from any McKinsey employee who was named as being involved in this project, and if any were to donate to Pete, we would immediately return their donation," a spokesman said.
A presidential rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, challenged Butti-gieg on Thursday night to release the names of his McKinsey clients, telling reporters, "I think voters want to know about possible conflicts of interest."
Buttigieg has repeatedly been critical when asked about McKinsey's controversial portfolio.
"As somebody who left the firm a decade ago, seeing what certain people in that firm have decided to do is extremely frustrating and extremely disappointing," Buttigieg said Wednesday.
While legal experts didn't doubt the legality of the confidentiality agreement, they questioned privatization of information that could be of use to the public.
"We can't just blithely give up on the public's right to know information by thinking, 'Well, there's a contract, there's a nondisclosure agreement, that's all we need to know, we can't get the information,'" said Alan Garfield, a professor who studies nondisclosure agreements at Widener University Delaware Law School.
Buttigieg could choose to break the agreement, but then he would risk facing expensive lawsuits from McKinsey or its clients.

Texto completo: In Texas and across the country, the E.P.A.'s gutting of the Chemical Disaster Rule is a matter of life or death.
HOUSTON -- While families across the country celebrated Thanksgiving with their loved ones, more than 50,000 people in Port Neches, Tex., were forced to evacuate from their homes and spend the holiday in makeshift shelters. The reason? Two explosions at the Texas Petroleum Chemical plant sent flames into the sky, injured eight people, and released plumes of butadiene, a carcinogen, into the air.
The disaster erupted six days after the Trump administration gutted Obama-era regulations meant to improve safety at 12,000 chemical plants around the country.
It's too soon to say whether these now abandoned rules would have made a difference in Port Neches. But there is no question that the communities that surround these thousands of plants are less safe now.
This regulatory rollback gives chemical plants across the country a free pass, in pursuit of greater profits, to operate in a way that endangers families and workers.
There are over 2,500 chemical facilities in the Houston area. Manchester, the neighborhood where Texas Environmental Justice Advocacy Services works, is among those most affected by this negligence. There are 30 chemical plants and waste sites in the Manchester area that report to the Environmental Protection Agency. When an explosion happens, nearby neighborhoods, mostly Latinx and people of color, are exposed to this toxicity.
And these toxic blasts are not infrequent. The last chemical explosion in Houston to garner national attention was in March at the Intercontinental Terminals Co., a few miles east of Manchester. This explosion led to high benzene levels in the air, school closures and community shelter-in-place orders for days: stay where you are, turn off air conditioning. Some advisories told people to put a plastic tarp over their windows, sealed with duct tape, to prevent air from coming in.
Federal regulations were supposed to protect us. For years, organizations like United Steelworkers, Greenpeace and dozens of other community and environmental organizations pressured the E.P.A. to make chemical disaster prevention a priority.
The turning point happened in 2013 when an explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Tex., 200 miles northwest of Houston, killed 15 people and injured over 260.
Later that year, President Barack Obama signed an executive order calling on federal agencies to create a task force. What emerged was the Chemical Disaster Rule, a proposal to improve plant safety and protect surrounding communities, which the former E.P.A. administrator Gina McCarthy approved one month before President Trump took office.
Two months later, the Trump administration blocked the regulations from taking effect, and now the E.P.A. has released a final rule that eviscerates the Obama-era requirements. The agency rescinded major accident prevention provisions, including requirements to consider safer technology, audits of accidents by outside parties and "root cause" analyses of accidents.
While Texas has the largest number of chemical facilities in the country, Illinois, California, Iowa and Louisiana are riddled with them, too. As The Houston Chronicle has documented, no state is spared from having at least one facility that could have toxic or flammable chemical accidents with consequences that extend beyond the site.
The E.P.A. calls these communities -- areas that could be affected by a release from a chemical accident -- "vulnerable zones." One in three children in America attends a school in a vulnerable zone. This means that over 19 million children are at risk of exposure to the harmful chemicals that these plants use, store and can emit when they produce plastics, pesticides, adhesives and other products.
Our neighborhoods in Houston are a case in point. The oil and gas facilities and chemical plants along the 52-mile Houston Ship Channel have turned the air in Harris County into a public health hazard, significantly increasing the likelihood of residents' developing cancer and respiratory problems -- and shortening the lives of children. Children living near the Houston Ship Channel are 56 percent more likely to develop leukemia than those who live more than 10 miles away.
To me this issue is personal. Yes, explosions from chemical facilities can be deadly. But the long-term impact of exposure to toxic chemicals also kills. In 2016, I was found to have hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a rare autoimmune system disorder that arises from breathing in dust or toxins repeatedly. The doctors blamed indoor air, but I am convinced that exposure to chemicals in Houston led to my condition. In this town, there's little distinction between the air indoors and what's outside.
When traveling -- I am now at the U.N. Climate talks in Madrid -- I bring a portable oxygen machine in case I need it. I am unable to walk long distances, and I move slowly because of my shortness of breath. Public speaking is difficult, as is any exertion. My life expectancy is not long (10 years, one doctor told me). I hope it is more.
In my family, lung diseases are the norm. My diagnosis came the same year that my father, Gregorio V. García, died of lung cancer at 79. He worked in the Asarco Refinery in Corpus Christi, Tex., and was a member of United Steelworkers for 30 years. Workers in these refineries are the first exposed to toxic substances. Many, like him, have died of cancer.
Plants like the nearby Valero facility emit a slew of poisonous chemicals like benzene and hydrogen cyanide into our neighborhoods. Far too often, they fail to meet Clean Air Act requirements.
During Hurricane Harvey in August 2017, I felt what it was like to breathe in a concentrated amount of toxic air. On the day of the worst flooding, my husband and I drove his pickup truck into Manchester to document what was happening at the Valero refinery. We saw water running from Valero into Hartman Park, where children gather to play baseball and soccer, and down the streets we knew well. As we drove, we had to cover our nose and mouth with our hands. My lips turned numb. The odor was so strong that it made me nauseated.
Three days later we found out that we had driven into one of the largest benzene spills. Benzene is clear, colorless and flammable. To date, this spill has not been adequately addressed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
In Houston, we struggle to get chemical facilities to follow the law. We ask our state to protect us from chemicals that no one should breathe. Now the federal government is ending safeguards that the E.P.A. only a few years ago said the industry needed to protect the lives of workers, emergency medical workers and communities like mine.
My life should not be a pawn for leveraging industry profits. Nor should those of my neighbors and their children. Families and workers in these neighborhoods deserve to be safe.
As disasters continue to happen, we -- those most affected, those who breathe and live and play in toxicity -- condemn the E.P.A.'s decision to repeal the Chemical Disaster Rule. We are denied basic health protections simply because the industry does not want to invest in our safety.
Families and workers across the country should not have to pay the ultimate cost of this administration's refusal to do its job: our lives.

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week in Washington, planning for a packed December, Republican leadership drops a candidate and the presidential field thins.
But first a quick plug: it’s MinnPost’s year-end member drive! That means that it’s time for me to ask you to become a sustaining member of MinnPost (if you’re not already). This newsletter is entirely powered by folks like you and your monthly donations help ensure we can keep it, and all of our other coverage going (that includes reporting, travel costs, and supplies). You can donate here.
Alright. Let’s get on with this.
’Tis the season
Washington is in for a crowded December. The House has extended its stay in Washington to December 20th. Just a quick few things they need to get done by then:
* The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). A trade deal already ratified in Mexico and Canada. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised the agreement would get a vote before the end of the year.
* Articles of impeachment. The House wants to pursue articles of impeachment this month, formally voting to ask the Senate to put President Donald Trump on trial. On Thursday morning Pelosi confirmed this move. The House Intelligence Committee, which has done the bulk of public impeachment work so far, does not plan to stop investigating the president after the vote. Impeachment proceedings continued this week, this time with a hearing of constitutional experts at the House Judiciary Committee.
* 12 appropriations bills. These bills, which fund government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Defense, need to pass to avert a government shutdown. Some Senate Republicans suggest there might be a year-long continuing resolution instead, which would set funding to the same levels as last year. However, doing this would mean government agencies can’t hire any seasonal contractors or temporary workers they might need additional funds for.
Something else on the horizon: Should China and the U.S. not agree to the first phase of a trade deal by Dec. 15th, the president has promised to implement $150 billion in tariffs on consumer goods, potentially sparking a much broader and damaging period in the trade war.
Trump to Hughes: Drop the 2018 Tweet endorsement
President Donald Trump’s campaign lawyers have asked Dave Hughes , a congressional candidate for Minnesota’s Seventh District , to stop featuring Trump’s Twitter endorsement of Hughes from 2018. Patrick Condon at the Strib has the story.
The news seems to fit with what I reported last month: Washington Republicans are trying to push Hughes, the two-time Republican nominee, from the race and are coalescing around another candidate: former Lt. Governor Michelle Fischbach.
The news from Kandiyohi County
In a 3-2 vote, the Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners voted Tuesday to accept more refugees into the county. The measure was passed in response to President Trump’s executive order from September, requiring state and local governments to give permission for refugee resettlement in their communities. The county settled only ten refugees last fiscal year.
Republicans cut ties with Florida candidate
A Republican congressional candidate who said Rep. Ilhan Omar should be hanged was dropped from a Republican party candidate mentorship and support program.
The National Republican Congressional Committee, run by Tom Emmer of Minnesota’s Sixth , dropped Florida 13 candidate George Buck from the “Young Guns” program, citing his suggestion that “we should hang” the Minneapolis member of Congress.
A representative for the NRCC said that Republican Party Chairman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) made the decision to remove Buck from the program. When asked if the NRCC would support Buck, should he be the nominee, the NRCC spokesperson did not provide an answer.
Danielle Stella , one of Omar’s challengers who is also QAnon conspiracy theorist, was banned from Twitter for saying something similar to Buck last week.
Minnesota primary
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign hired an in-state field director, who will start next week: Joelle Stangler , the current political director for TakeAction Minnesota and formerly of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s campaign.
An October poll done by the Kaiser Family Foundation found Sen. Elizabeth Warren with 25 percent support in the state, Klobuchar with 15, Biden with 14, and Sanders with 13. For some added historical context, in 2016, several polls showed Hillary Clinton with a substantial lead (20%+) over Bernie Sanders. He won the caucus 61.6% to 38.4%.
The president next door
Sen. Amy Klobuchar has two new policies out this week: a policy to deal with the changing economy (tax credits to retrain workers who lose their jobs to automatic, language to help “gig” workers like Uber drivers unionize) and a national service program policy (increased investment in AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps and a proposed a Climate Civilian Conservation Corps).
In Iowa, where Klobuchar has placed the bulk of her campaign and her presidential hopes, the Senator Next Door aims to double the amount of field offices. She also aims to increase the number of staff to something more than the current 60. She’s hired veteran Iowa Democratic political operative Norm Sterzenbach, who previously served as the executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party and, more recently, on Beto O’Rourke’s campaign.
The next Democratic debate will be December 19th, the same week as Congress is set to leave D.C. Klobuchar has already qualified. So has California billionaire Tom Steyer. New York Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has not. The senator has thoughts: “You just can’t simply allow wealthy people to come in and buy elections,” Klobuchar said earlier this week on The View.
In other presidential news, after a few late additions like Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg, the presidential field is thinning. This week, we lost three: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Pennsylvania Rep. Joe Sestak, and California Sen. Kamala Harris.
In other news
* Minneapolis fire investigators are unsure what caused the deadly fire at Cedar High Apartments last week, but pointed to potential causes: a baseboard heater, an electrical short circuit, smoking or “use of smoking materials.”
* Embattled San Diego Republican Duncan Hunter is set to resign from Congress after pleading guilty to misusing campaign funds on things like flying the family’s two pet bunnies, Eggburt and Cadbury.
* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is mulling a run for Senate in Kansas, calling several mega donors who have been known to support Republican campaigns.
Quote of the week
“The communist party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public,” said presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg.
What I’m reading
Astead Herndon for The New York Times: Black Voters to Black Candidates: Representation Is Not Enough
The next Democratic debate will feature only white candidates, prompting outcry from an increasingly diverse Democratic party base. With people of color, particularly Black voters, functioning as the base of the party, Astead Herdon asks: Why Biden, Bernie and Warren?

Pelosi's political death warrant for Democrats in Trump districts [Corrected 12/07/2019]

Texto completo: With her announcement that Democrats will move forward and vote on articles of impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have signed a political death warrant for dozens of moderate Democrats elected in Trump districts.
Pelosi is speaker today because in 2018 Democrats were able to convince voters in 31 House districts Trump carried two years before to defect and vote for them. Democrats need these voters to stay in their column in 2020 if they are to hold onto the House and win back the White House.
But in key swing states, large majorities of these 2018 defectors now say they plan to back Trump again in 2020. The New York Times reported that "nearly two-thirds of voters in six battleground states who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 -- but for Democratic congressional candidates in 2018 -- say they intend to back the president against each of his top rivals." The Times also reported that in 2018, voters in these states cast their ballots "for Democratic congressional candidates by an average of six points, all but identical to their actual winning margins." That means these freshman Democrats already face an uphill battle to hold onto their seats.
Now, Pelosi is adding to their woes by forcing them to vote to recommend the removal of a president that voters in their districts say they plan to reelect. Already, she forced them to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry, and all but two did so. But there is a world of difference between backing an impeachment inquiry and voting to impeach. Before the hearings began, swing-state voters said they supported the impeachment inquiry by a margin of 50% to 45%, but opposed impeaching and removing Trump by 53% to 43%. After weeks of wall-to-wall hearings, polls show that Democrats failed to move the needle in favor of impeachment and removal. Indeed, in Wisconsin, opposition to removal has nearly doubled. In other words, Democrats have failed to make their case.
By moving forward with impeachment anyway, Pelosi is putting her most vulnerable members in a terrible position. Split-ticket voting is already rare. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that that election "saw the highest percentage of STRAIGHT-ticket voters in more than a century." And according to FiveThirtyEight, split-ticket voting hit a new low in 2018. Impeachment makes it even less likely that swing-state voters will split their tickets. Are voters really going to cast ballots to give Trump four more years and also to reelect the Democratic House members who tried to take that decision out of their hands by impeaching him?
Voters in these Trump districts are already frustrated with their Democratic representatives. They won on promises to work with the president to address issues like health care, prescription drug prices, infrastructure and trade. None of that is getting done, thanks to Democrats' focus on impeachment. Indeed, there is speculation in the White House that the reason Pelosi has been slow-rolling the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement Trump negotiated is not out of reluctance to give Trump a win, but because she needs it as leverage with her moderate members to get their votes for impeachment. "She's using USMCA to get the impeachment vote," Trump has said.
Pelosi isn't stupid. She would not have announced a vote on articles of impeachment if she didn't believe she had the votes. But while she can strong-arm the moderates in her caucus, she can't strong-arm the voters in their districts. Her decision to move forward with impeachment means that many of those 31 Democrats seem destined to lose in November. Apparently, that is a price she is willing to pay to placate her party's virulent anti-Trump base.

Texto completo: NORFOLK - Right on time, the Virginia Stage Company has unveiled its traditional presentation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," showing how even the worst of misers can become a good Samaritan.
No "bah, humbugs!" allowed.
In 1993, The New York Times wrote that Dickens was inspired to write the story after a visit to a ragged school, which were common in nineteenth-century Britain.
These schools were often set up in working-class neighborhoods and dedicated to providing free education to poor children.
Dickens, who grew up in poverty himself, felt a connection to those children, which he described hiding in the robes of Christmas Present as "yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate too in their humility." He thought his now-historic tale might help to help lift them up.
"A Christmas Carol" is 176 years old, but the book has never gone out of print and Dickens' story is performed on thousands of stages across the world every year. The Virginia Stage Company has been performing the tale since 1996.
Nearly everyone knows the story: a cold-hearted curmudgeon, Ebenezer Scrooge, journeys through Christmas past, present and future.
By the end of his miraculous time travels and hard-learned lessons, Scrooge - who had just refused to help the needy and scolded his loyal employee for expecting a day off for Christmas - decides to turn his life around and use his wealth to do good.
The story still delivers all the holiday warm-and-fuzzies and, as Dickens hoped, inspires many to pay it forward.
Virginia Stage Company has been presenting this play for xx years. This year features a new director, Marianne Savell; a new Scrooge, Steven Minow; and a new character, Dickens himself, as narrator, played by John Forkner.
In the spirit of the season, we asked some of the cast members to share their Christmas traditions and fondest memories.
Adalee Alt, playing Tiny Tim
On Christmas Eve, my mom reads us "'Twas the night before Christmas." After that, we set out cookies and carrots for Santa and his reindeer.
Rhys West, playing Boy Scrooge
I have a lot of favorite holiday and winter traditions that I love. When it snows outside I love to go sledding, but not in Virginia Beach because there are no hills. I also love to make snow cream with my family. I love picking out our Christmas tree at the Christmas tree farms. One of my favorite things to do is to watch people's reactions when they get their gifts. Spending time with family and no homework is also a plus! My family and I love to listen to Christmas music and sing Christmas carols on the record player.
Steven Minow, playing Ebenezer Scrooge
I am from Sacramento, Calif. For a time we had a philanthropic group called Christmas Promise whose mission was to provide a magical Christmas Eve visit from Santa himself. Because I am an actor, my sister's mother-in-law who was very much involved with the group asked if I would be interested in playing one of the Santas. Because they would endeavor to bring Christmas to as many destitute families as possible, it required about 50 Santas. Each of us were assigned three to four families to visit, unannounced on the eve of the big day. We each had our own elves, drivers and beautifully wrapped packages of toys, clothing, and even brand new bicycles for the children. One especially heart-warming visit, I got to give a little boy a brand new skateboard. He ran outside immediately. When he came back inside I asked, "Peter, where'd you go?" He responded, "I went outside to see the reindeer!"
Tre'Veon Porchia, playing Dick Wilkins
Every year, my immediate family, my grandma, my aunt, and my uncle on my mom's side meet at my house. Before I turned 18, all of the kids were upstairs while everyone brought in the presents and we stayed upstairs until they told us we could come down. My grandma always brought humongous red stockings full of food and clothes and presents. My aunt and uncle always brought the most delicious cookies that they only make at Christmas time. My mom would make a breakfast casserole, lasagna, and mimosa (non-alcoholic, of course). After that, we take a few hours to enjoy our presents and hang out before going to my aunt's house to see the rest of the family. I've come to expect the same routine every year and I enjoy it.
Lynn Kenny Richards, playing Mrs. Cratchit
Our family celebrates the German tradition of St. Nick's Day on the morning of Dec. 6 with a stocking of goodies, opening an advent calendar each day of the month and presents under the tree on Christmas morning. We like to serve at our church as well as helping to collect food for local food pantries and toys for The Salvation Army.
Ryan Clemens, playing Jacob Marley
My fondest Christmas tradition has become performing in VSC's "A Christmas Carol." For the past eight seasons, I have been honored and blessed to be a part of this story. I've played Bob Cratchit, Fezziwig, the Charity Man, Old Joe and Marley, too! This production is one that is so meaningful to me, our company, our community, and countless children who've come to enjoy the magic and wonder of live theater. Each new year and each performance, there is a shared joy that brings every person in the Wells Theatre together with full hearts and lifted spirits.

U-M, Kentucky to play in London in 2020

Texto completo: Michigan basketball is heading across the pond.
The Wolverines are scheduled to play Kentucky in a blockbuster matchup in London in December 2020, U-M announced Thursday. The game is part of a three-game series between the teams that includes a home-and-home agreement for 2021-22 and 2022-23.
The 2020 game will be played at London's O2 Arena. It will be the first college basketball game to take place at the venue, which has hosted NBA games.
In 2021, Michigan will host Kentucky at Crisler Center in Ann Arbor. In 2022, the Wolverines will travel to Rupp Arena in Lexington.
"When the idea of playing Kentucky came up, we knew it would be an exciting opportunity, not only for ourselves, but for our fans as well," said Michigan coach Juwan Howard in a statement. "What a unique three-game series. First, we get to showcase collegiate basketball overseas in London before playing that traditional home-and-home series in front of two of the nation's best basketball environments. We cannot wait."
Michigan has played outside the country before but mostly in early season tournaments like last week's 'Battle 4 Atlantis' in the Bahamas.
Michigan has not played Kentucky since 2014, when the Wolverines lost to the Wildcats in the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament. Before that, their last meeting was in 1993, when Howard and the Fab Five beat Kentucky in the Final Four.
The London game was a vision of Kentucky coach John Calipari, who first said he was considering the overseas game in a summer interview with The Cats' Pause. The game was organized as part of a fundraiser for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, according to the New York Times, and a second game between University of Maryland-Baltimore County and Marist is part of the deal.
And it might not be the only overseas game Michigan plays in the near future.
Jim Harbaugh, who took his football team on spring trips to Italy, France and South Africa the past three years, intends to play a game overseas. In July, he hinted an announcement should be coming soon.
"You can talk to (athletic director Warde Manuel) about this. But I think we're really close to announcing playing another team on foreign soil," Harbaugh said after being asked a question about whether or not he'd be open to playing a game in Mexico City. "I won't say what it is. Have you heard about this? I'd better not say it because they're probably not ready to release that yet.
"I think there's something imminent. ... An announcement soon on that."

TONY DANZA REMINISCES ABOUT 'TAXI,' 'WHO'S THE BOSS?' AND FRED ROGERS

Texto completo: When Tony Danza watches episodes of "Who's the Boss?" with his 8-year-old grandson, what makes him particularly proud are the positive messages.
Danza, 67, who starred in the sitcom in 1984-92, worries about the mostly provocative fare available to kids today.
"What can they watch to show how to play by the rules, to learn about loyalty - the stuff we grew up with?" he wonders. "We are assuming that even though they are not hearing those messages, they know. I always say this in my act: 'We grew up with nothing but love songs, and look how we turned out.'"
He is reminded that when he comes to Steel City Con at the Monroeville Convention Center this weekend, he will be in the land of Mister Rogers, whose messages of love and kindness are part of Pittsburgh's DNA.
"Oh, I have a story to tell you about him!" Danza says. It's a story that is quintessentially the man depicted in "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
"I was on a show bemoaning turning 40 - which I find embarrassing now," he says with a laugh. "And then I got a letter, from Fred Rogers. He told me 40 is the beginning of the best part of life, just a stop along the journey. I have it framed."
Danza never intended to be an actor when he was growing up in New York. He left for a wrestling scholarship at the University of Iowa and then gained popularity and a few KOs as a middleweight boxer - before he was discovered for the role of Tony Banta on "Taxi."
Danza caught lightning in a bottle twice - "an apt way to put it," he says - very early in his acting career. "Taxi" ran from 1978-83, and he was quickly back in a popular sitcom with "Who's the Boss?" "Taxi," in particular, has had a long life in syndication. During one station's "Taxi" marathon, he caught up with 19 episodes.
"I laughed at every one. They're still fresh and funny," Danza says. "And my son was on the show when he was 7, so now his son can watch his dad."
These days, fans are most likely to approach him about his role on "Who's the Boss?" Danza played a father and former baseball player who becomes a live-in housekeeper for a divorced executive, played by Judith Light, the award-winning actress out of Carnegie Mellon University.
"If Judith is any indication of the kind of acting and artistic education you get at Carnegie Mellon, that's what I wish I had, because she is unbelievable," Danza said. "I used to say, 'Judith is such a great actress, she could cry out of one eye at a time, and wink with the other. She's magnificent, a great woman. I'm very lucky to have her in my life."
Most fans think of Danza as a screen actor, but he's also a song-and-dance man who made his Broadway debut in the Jason Robert Brown musical "Honeymoon in Vegas." His character was a gangster who tries to steal away a bride on her wedding day, because she reminds him of his dead wife.
The New York Times review said he brought some Sinatra to the proceedings, another apt description. Danza's mother was one of those bobbysoxers who swooned over Frank Sinatra, and her son got to know music's Chairman of the Board.
Danza has tried to adopt the Sinatra attitude - "his in-chargeness" - throughout his career. So naturally, when he was struggling to find his character in "Honeymoon in Vegas," it was Sinatra who came to his rescue.
Nobody knows this story," says Danza, "but I was having trouble with the part. Is he a bad guy? Is he funny? Is he is serious? I felt like I was stinking out the joint around these great actors, Rob McClure, David Josefsberg. . Anyway, I was sitting at home and I hit my iPhone, and what came on?"
He starts to sing Sinatra's "I'm a Fool to Want You."
"I looked at the script, and thought, 'If Frank Sinatra was alive today, this is the part he'd be playing. The next day, I took that with me, and the director said, 'Oh, I want more of that.' So yeah," Danza concludes, "he's a big influence on my life."
When Danza swings into Pittsburgh this weekend, it will be for the first time since 1991, when he starred in the TV movie "Dead or Alive: The Race for Gus Farace."
"I played a murderer in that one - I killed Sam Jackson!," he recalled of the movie about Costabile ''Gus'' Farace, who killed a federal drug agent in 1989 New York City.
He's looking forward to seeing how the city has changed, but mostly, he is looking forward to meeting his fans.
"I never did these things," he said of conventions such as Steel City Con, "and then a friend talked me into it. I found that people are so happy to see you. It's such a soul-enriching experience. I'm really looking forward to coming back to Pittsburgh."

Howard Cruse, 75, pioneering artist of LGBTQ comics known for his generosity

Texto completo: Cartoons “go straight for feelings," Howard Cruse told The Village Voice in 1988. “A good cartoon is shorthand for a perspective on life," he added. “It can get at the truth of experience without having to depict it literally."
As a pioneering artist in ­LGBTQ comics, Mr. Cruse illuminated the truths lived by those who were lesbian or gay or bisexual or transgender — whose experiences were largely excluded from that realm of creative expression.
In the 1970s, and even into the '80s when he spoke with the Voice's Richard Goldstein, there was “still a lot of pressure to view comics strictly as a children's medium," he said, and homophobia was not simply prevalent — “it was generally considered hip to dismiss gay people, as it is today."
Mr. Cruse, who had lived in Williamstown in recent years, was 75 when he died Nov. 26 in a Pittsfield hospital. His husband, Ed Sedarbaum, said the cause was complications from lymphoma.
Some forty years ago, Mr. Cruse was the founding editor of Gay Comix, which was one of the first series to feature work by and for openly gay men and women, and which showcased his work and that of women such as Roberta Gregory and Mary Wings.
He then developed “Wendel," a comic strip about a man and his lover navigating the early years of the AIDS epidemic. His work both inspired artists who followed and opened doors for them.
Alison Bechdel, whose 2006 graphic memoir “Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic" was adapted into a Tony Award-winning musical, bought the first issue of Gay Comix at the Oscar Wilde Bookshop in Greenwich Village soon after moving to Manhattan.
“I had no career goals until I picked up that comic, and I knew at that moment what I was going to do with my life," Bechdel told The New York Times. “He created a path for me and many other queer cartoonists."
Cartoonist Justin Hall, a California College of the Arts professor who edited the collection “No Straight Lines: Four Decades of Queer Comics," called Mr. Cruse “one of the greatest cartoonists of his generation."
Hall told The Washington Post that Mr. Cruse “is known as the godfather of queer comics, not just because of his artistic talent, not just because of his pioneering works, but because of his generosity, his belief in community, and his dedication to helping us all."
Mr. Cruse was first known for his 1970s series “Barefootz," which featured a friendly young man with oversized bare feet, and which later included a gay character. The cartoon appeared in magazines and in anthologies by publisher Denis Kitchen.
Kitchen invited Mr. Cruse to edit what became Gay Comix, which was released with the tagline: “Lesbians and Gay Men Put It on Paper!"
Mr. Cruse edited the first four issues of Gay Comix, which debuted in 1980 and also featured cartoonists such as Robert Triptow and Trina Robbins. Gay Comix aimed to present stories that showed gay men and lesbians as true-to-life characters, rather than caricatures. Mr. Cruse eventually handed off editing duties to focus on his 1980s comic strip “Wendel," about a gay writer and his partner during the Reagan years.
Appearing in the LGBTQ magazine The Advocate, the strip “was the first time the intimate life of a gay couple had been shown in a serious way," Hall said.
It also touched on issues including AIDS and gay bashing, which Mr. Cruse said he endured in 1973 when he was attacked in Atlanta's Piedmont Park.
“Almost all of my comic strips, one way or another, are my life seen through a prism — not necessarily the details of it, but my emotional observations of it," he once told the Advocate.
Through his work, Mr. Cruse came to understand the importance of representing himself, as well as other gay men and lesbians, in comic books.
“It's tremendously empowering when you're gay to realize that you've been doing it right, and it's the bigots who are stumbling about in a fog about this subject," he said in the interview with the Voice, where he had been an occasional contributor.
His other work included 1995's “Stuck Rubber Baby," which told the story of Toland Polk, a closeted gay man in Clayfield, Ala. — a fictionalized Birmingham — who becomes involved in civil rights demonstrations.
Toland's friends include Ginger, an activist with whom he has a child (a plot point that paralleled Mr. Cruse's life), and Les, a black man who becomes his first gay lover.
Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner provided Mr. Cruse with some financial support during the writing process and wrote an introduction for “Stuck Rubber Baby," which won a Harvey Award and an Eisner Award, two of the most prestigious honors in comic books.
In a Chicago Tribune review, Harvey Pekar, the comic book writer known for his series “American Splendor," wrote that “barren of superheroes or talking animals, 'Stuck Rubber Baby' certainly isn't standard comic book fare. The people most likely to enjoy the book will be enthusiasts of good contemporary fiction, although most of them are unused to shopping for comics."
Howard Russell Cruse was born on May 2, 1944, in Birmingham and grew up in nearby Springville, Ala. His father, Clyde, was a Methodist minister and photojournalist, and his mother, Irma Russell, was a Southern Bell Telephone executive.
Aspiring to be a syndicated cartoonist from an early age, Mr. Cruse copied the styles of artists such as Al Capp, whose “Li'l Abner," a satirical strip about a hillbilly clan, was extremely popular.
During high school, he published a comic strip in a local paper and also traveled to Manhattan on a trip arranged by one of his high school teachers to meet Milton Caniff, creator of the comic strips “Terry and the Pirates" and “Steve Canyon."
At Birmingham-Southern College, where he studied art and theater, Mr. Cruse acted and designed sets for stage productions. After graduating, he joined a Birmingham television station as an art director and puppeteer and created a daily single-panel cartoon about squirrels that ran for two years in The Birmingham Post-Herald.
Mr. Cruse and Sedarbaum, his partner of 40 years, settled in Williamstown and married in 2004 after same-sex marriage was legalized in Massachusetts.
In addition to his husband, Mr. Cruse's survivors include his daughter, Kimberly Kolze Venter of Roswell, Ga.; his brother, Allan of San Francisco; and two grandchildren.
According to a funeral home notice, services will be private and a public memorial gathering will be announced.
Venter, who is 55 and met Mr. Cruse when she was 21 and in search of her birth parents, wrote of her father on Facebook: “He left a legacy with his artwork and was a trailblazer in this time. I'm so proud of him and so blessed he was in my life."
In the 1988 Voice interview, Mr. Cruse said he was “interested in the undercurrents of life, the ways that people relate to each other, whether they're gay or straight; the way they love each other and betray each other. These are the things that make all narrative art resonate."

Re "More Are Dying From Infections That Foil Drugs" (front page, Nov. 14):
I applaud the courage that it took New York health officials to disclose the names of medical facilities that have treated patients with Candida auris. Their brave actions set the tone and call the industry together to combat this deadly, antibiotic-resistant and extremely mysterious fungus.
Embracing transparency and collaboration is critical to finding solutions to minimize the threat. We stand a better chance of winning the battle together than alone. If we create strong partnerships, we can help one another optimize processes and work flows to drive behavior change and sustain infection prevention outcomes.
C. auris can spread in health care settings through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, or from person to person. Let's not overlook the power of simple solutions to such a complex and ominous threat.
Diligent hand-washing and environmental hygiene can prevent and contain pathogens like C. auris, C. difficile and other drug-resistant pathogens.
As pathogens continue to evolve for survival, it's our collective duty to fight as hard as we can to keep patients safe.

Texto completo: Headnote A solution to gifts that nobody needs or wants
Roger Hedgecock and I served on the campaign committee of Houston Flournoy, the 1974 GOP candidate for California governor. When he successfully ran for County Supervisor I supported him as I did when he successfully ran for San Diego Mayor. My help: a maximum campaign contribution.
When Mayor Hedgecock was criminally indicted for 13 felony counts of lying on campaign contribution reports, I supported him. The jury voted 11 to 1 for conviction. When retried I supported him.
He was convicted. He appealed. He was removed from office by law. He was immediately hired as a radio talk show host on San Diego's all-news station.
His show was a daily xenophobic blast about how Mexico and Mexicans were ripping off the United States and invading it with 30 millions of illegal aliens. Within weeks his show was number one in San Diego, the 8 th largest city in the U.S. and the largest city on the Mexican border. His audience ratings among dozens of stations was a solid 9.
He even substituted for Rush Limbaugh, until Limbaugh discovered that Hedgecock had been convicted by 23 of 24 jurors of 13 felonies.
I was new to newspaper commentary but my home paper was La Prensa-San Diego and I was carried from time to time in the San Diego Union and Evening Tribune - people knew me. Hedgecock eagerly debated me on his show whenever I called in. I called regularly because he would taunt me over the air to call to debate his xenophobia. As it turned out, those calls, some of which led to on-air debates lasting 20-30 minutes, eventually led to my being hired for my own nightly radio talk show on the same station and, to television commentaries and analysis.
Staking out positions that supported Mexico, Mexicans and immigrants was easy for me. After all I was an honor student in high school and college, a published writer/journalist, a speaker of English and Spanish and was actually born in Mexico where I lived until my American citizen mother brought me to the U.S. when I was three.
Note: I have never demeaned the U.S. ever, only some of its people who masquerade as Americans but have no idea what the Constitution is or what the Declaration of Independence says. I do pick on U.S. Navy squids and soldiers with their cute berets, however.
Another plus for the show's weeknight and weekend programming on San Diego radio was the fact that I had enlisted in the United States Marine Corps on my eighteenth birthday and proudly served for eight years, active and in the U. S. Marine Corps Reserve. In all San Diego radio, I was the only former United States Marine on air.
Add Spanish-speaking three million American resident people in our signal area, plus Tijuana's million, plus all 60,000 active duty Marines stationed in San Diego and Orange County Marine bases, their families and thousands of retired Marines and their families - add all those people and I had an audience. On Saturday/Sunday mornings, I led the a.m. radio market; I even beat NPR.
Before I was hired for my own show, I affirmatively responded when Hedgecock asked me to appear on his show, usually to debate some right-wing nut about immigration. Those appearances helped get my own show.
Then one day I was on the Hedgecock show, in studio, debating a former Army sergeant who had no college and easily handled anything he had to say. When we finished, former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock who had escaped military service during Vietnam because he had pimples (technically a skin condition, something like bone spurs) and couldn't pass the physical, asked me the question that could have come out of Donald Trump's mouth today.
"If," he asked, "the United States and Mexico went to war, which side would you support?"
I looked at him and said, " My service in the United States Marine Corps speaks for itself. I didn't dodge the draft with pimples on my face. I not only served, I loved it."
We've not spoken since. Good thing there was a seven second delay on his microphone or his fandom would have had coronaries.
What's going on today with childish comments about four U.S. citizen congress people, three of whom were born here, going back "to where they came from," brings back that memory.
If your skin looks like mine, someone somewhere will "suggest" I go back where I came from; or, ask which side I would be on in a U.S war with Mexico.
To all those people, all of them regardless of rank, social or economic position, Semper Fi..! Been there and done that, have you?

Texto completo: Folk singer and songwriter Lucy Kaplansky, known for her honest and heart-rending music, has made some pivotal decisions in her life. After graduating high school in Chicago in the late 1970s, rather than attend college she went to New York’s Greenwich Village to be part of its resurgent folk scene.
There, she became friends with other young folk singers, including Shawn Colvin and Suzanne Vega, also on the precipice of success.
The New York Times heralded a 21-year-old Kaplansky as a future voice of folk, saying that if the record business had been healthy, it would be easy to predict success for her.
“I was this incredibly neurotic kid, and I couldn’t handle any of it,” she said in a November phone interview from her home in New York. “I couldn’t let myself pursue it, couldn’t let myself have what I wanted.”
Kaplansky went back to school, became a doctor of psychology and worked in Manhattan with mentally ill patients at St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital. She also started a private practice.
Yet she longed to sing, to write songs, to perform.
Kaplansky, 59, recalls the moment during a therapy session that she decided to come home to music.
Colvin had become well known, and Kaplansky was saying she wouldn’t want that kind of fame, money and success.
The psychologist said two words that changed her life: “Why not?”
Kaplansky didn’t have an answer. “I was lying to myself,” she said. After realizing a career in music was what she most desired, there was no turning back.
“It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done in my life, to say, ‘I have to go back to singing.’ I had no idea if I could get anywhere, how good I was. I just didn’t know. I knew I had to do it because if I didn’t, I’d never, ever, forgive myself.”
Kaplansky’s debut album, 1994’s “The Tide,” gained wide notice in folk circles and showcased her luminous voice.
She followed that with 1996’s “Flesh and Bone,” another mix of originals and covers, including novel interpretations of songs by Elvis Costello and Richard and Linda Thompson.
Kaplansky took another quantum leap in 1998 when she teamed with Dar Williams and Richard Shindell to form the short-lived folk supergroup Cry Cry Cry.
Their harmonies were enticing, and the selection of under-the-radar covers, such as Greg Brown’s “Lord, I Have Made You a Place in My Heart,” enthralled their fans.
“Some of the best songs I’ve ever had the pleasure of singing are on that album,” Kaplansky said. “We all get a kick out of each other. When we first started doing gigs 21 years ago, I couldn’t believe the response we got.”
Cry Cry Cry toured last year to mark their 20th anniversary. Kaplansky also has collaborated with other like-minded folk singers, including John Gorka and Eliza Gilkyson in the trio Red Horse.
Kaplansky’s most recent album, “Everyday Street,” came out last year to rave reviews. It was her first release in six years.
The opening track is a duet with Colvin called “Old Friends.” The album feels intimate, like one of Kaplansky’s acoustic shows. That’s no accident.
If You Go
Who: Lucy Kaplansky
When: 8:30 p.m., Friday, Dec. 13
Where: HopMonk, 224 Vintage Way, Novato
Tickets: $25 to $35
Information: 415-892-6200, www.hopmonk.com/novato, lucykaplansky.com
Rather than record with a full band, Kaplansky enlisted longtime collaborator Duke Levine to play a number of instruments and had Colvin and Shindell sing harmonies.
“It’s the most acoustic album I’ve ever made,” Kaplansky said. She sells it only through her website (digital download or signed CD, lucykaplansky.com) and at her shows.
The thoughtful lyrics reveal Kaplansky’s insight into human nature. One standout song is “Sixth Avenue,” an ode to her daughter written when the girl was 10. Here’s a sample: “So I let you cross Sixth Avenue. Soon the crowd is all I see. I keep on looking, I can’t let go, and I know you’re not looking for me. Just how it’s supposed to be.”
Kaplansky said her goal is to write good songs.
“What does that mean?” she asked herself. “Interesting, emotionally challenging, truthful, not cliché, that’s what I strive for.”
“Her songs are co-written with her husband, filmmaker Rick Litvin. She collaborated, in a way, with another member of her family, too, her father, renowned mathematician Irving Kaplansky, who died in 2006.
“My dad wrote songs starting in 1937, when he was 20. I heard them my entire life growing up.”
Twenty years ago, Lucy Kaplansky told her husband she needed some light and funny material in her shows.
“He said, ‘Why don’t you do one of your dad’s songs?’ I sing them because people like them. They’re funny and clever,” she said.
Kaplansky compared her father’s wit to that of the humorist and songwriter Tom Lehrer. As it so happens, Lehrer was one of her father’s math students at Harvard.
“I love Tom Lehrer’s songs, but they’re too well-known,” she said. “If I had discovered Tom’s songs and nobody had heard them, I would do those, too.”
Kaplansky is always adding to her repertoire. A month ago she was listening to Jackson Browne’s “Late for the Sky” in her car for the first time in ages.
That night she sat down at her piano during a sound check, figured out the chords and played the song during her show. “I’ve been doing it in my shows since then.”
Kaplansky said she’s reached a stage in life when she’s mostly content. Though it’s harder to make a living as a musician, she appreciates every moment.
“I don’t take for granted that it’s not going to last forever,” she said. Every time she comes home from a successful gig, she tells her husband, “It’s not over yet!”

Programs Teach Children How To Respond To Extreme Weather Threats

Texto completo: Damariya Carlisle, age 9, jumped as an instructor hauled a crab pot onto the steel deck of the barge docked on the Elizabeth River, a Chesapeake tributary in Norfolk, Virginia.
She marveled at the Atlantic blue crabs’ claws but worried they might pinch her. The visit was part of a fourth-grade class trip in October.
“They get to see and feel real crabs,” said Janet Goldbach Ehmer, an educator with the Elizabeth River Project who pulled the trap from the water. “It helps to create a personal connection and investment in the river.”
The Elizabeth River Project received about $500,000 for youth resiliency education as part of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant program to encourage children’s resilience when faced with climate-related disasters. The grants are intended to teach young people and adults to better respond to threats like sea-level rise, severe storms, flooding, drought and extreme heat.
A main focus of the grants is to encourage students to answer: “What can I do to make myself” - as well as my family and my community - “more resilient?” said Sarah Schoedinger, a senior program manager in NOAA’s education office. “How do we rebound to something” that might leave us in a position that is “better than before?”
The Elizabeth River Project welcomes up to 200 students a day on field trips to its 120-by-32-foot learning barge. It enlists the Atlantic blue crab as a means to teach students in the area about increased flooding and sea-level rise, nudging students toward actions they can take to reduce climate impacts.
“You don’t have to grow up to do these actions,” Goldbach Ehmer tells students. “You can start these actions today.”
After attending the program, Damariya vowed to turn off lights and computers more often.
Since 2015, NOAA’s Environmental Literacy Program has awarded nearly $10 million to 22 resiliency programs across the country, in both coastal and inland states.
The programs provide education, and projects include building rain barrels, planting trees, hosting resiliency expos, collecting environmental data and interviewing community members about extreme weather events. The approach is intended to help stave off the paralysis or anxiety that may occur when confronted with climate data that may feel overwhelming.
Robin Dunbar, Elizabeth River’s deputy director of education, said, “Our whole message has not been scary” or all “gloom and doom.” She added: “I’m not trying to just push cupcakes and unicorns. We do include real science for all ages.”
Several of the programs aim to empower students to take part in community resiliency planning.
“Sometimes, when talking about big environmental issues,” Dunbar said, “there’s this idea: We need the adults to figure this out. I always come in and say, ‘Let the kids have a part in this.’”
Over the summer, middle-school boys in a hazard resiliency program in Gunnison, Colorado, that caters to rural schools hashed out how to protect their small town at the base of the Rocky Mountains from an approaching wildfire as part of a board game that incorporates hazard survival strategies.
“The foothills closest to your community have been burning for several days and your community has been blanketed with smoke,” read one of the game’s emergency updates.
The game, developed by the Boulder-based Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, is intended to prime students to help if a real flood, drought or fire threatens their communities. The institute received about $200,000 for the project, which is estimated to reach 600 students across Colorado.
Many of the programs target underserved communities.
“For youth and their families who live in underserved communities, this is not an abstract issue,” said Ethan Lowenstein, director of the Southeast Michigan Stewardship Coalition at Eastern Michigan University. Climate change can affect young people in ways that are not immediately obvious, Lowenstein said. For example, if sports fields flood, students miss practices and games, which may affect their ability to get scholarships.
The coalition is a partner in a program called Climate Resilience From the Youth Up, which brings together high school students, educators, scientists and community members in Detroit and southeast Michigan.
Grant recipients hope student enthusiasm will spur action in neighboring communities. Watershed Management Group, an environmental nonprofit in Tucson, Arizona, engages students to design and build rain gardens, using native plants and trees and diverting stormwater runoff from school buildings to water the gardens.
Students learn about extreme weather patterns and how rain gardens mitigate extreme heat and flooding. They calculate water flows and choose materials. Students and volunteers gather, typically on a Saturday, to build the gardens.
On a recent morning, Riley Fletcher, age 13, checked temperatures throughout the rain garden that stretches along a side of Drachman Montessori K-8 Magnet School in Tucson.
“When I first came to the school, it was dead dirt,” said Riley, an eighth-grader. “Nature can really be beautiful and not only look that way, but it also helps the world.”

Texto completo: 'Canyon Dreams'
By Michael Powell, Blue Rider, 272 pages, $28
In August, Netflix released "Basketball or Nothing," a gem of a series about a high school team in Chinle, a dusty pocket of Navajo Nation in northeast Arizona. The show features an eye-catching setting, nail-biting moments on the court and compulsively watchable characters -- particularly Raul Mendoza, the team's grumpy-yet-avuncular coach.
The show does have a flaw, though: The series suggests that the kids vying for a state title will have their lives entirely foreclosed upon them if they can't find a way to escape the reservation and get a college degree. "There's really nothing going on in Chinle," are the first words uttered in the series. Water is scarce; unemployment and addiction are abundant.
It's not an incorrect assessment, but it is a narrow one. So it's worth watching the series in tandem with Michael Powell's engrossing, more expansive book, "Canyon Dreams," which covers the same team during the same 2017-18 season and clarifies its story. For the players at Chinle High School, the rez and the rest of the world aren't binaries in opposition. They're connected worlds that they're compelled to navigate as skillfully as they do the hardwood courts.
Basketball, Powell writes, is a "harmonizing force in this immense land," an essential part of day-to-day culture in Chinle. That means long lines at the ticket window on game days and lots of people tuning their radios for game broadcasts throughout Navajo Nation, which stretches across northern Arizona and New Mexico. But it also means Mendoza is treated as a standard-bearer for an entire community. Family members give him an earful about respect every time he benches their kid. "In past seasons with different teams, witches had cast spells at him, and warlocks had conspired, and angry relatives had loosened the lug nuts on his tires," Powell writes.
Powell, a New York Times sports columnist, lived on Navajo Nation briefly a quarter century ago. He writes with a clear affection, respect and understanding.
His position may explain why the central figure in his narrative is Mendoza, who is an outsider himself. Part Mexican and part Tohono O'odham (a southern Arizona tribe), Mendoza was hired by Chinle less for his precise cultural fit than because he has a state-title ring and a history as a counselor who keeps kids on track. Unemployment on Navajo Nation is 45%, fewer than half of Chinle High School graduates go to college, and nearly every player on the team has a story about a broken home to share. "Do you know what I'm proudest of in this life?" Mendoza tells Powell. "Not a single one of those teenagers I counseled committed suicide. They lived, every single one of them."
But Powell also widens his range to encompass the history and culture of the region. In Albuquerque, he catches up with a former Chinle player who's trying to make a life for himself after an injury, uncertain about life off the rez. Watching an English class at the high school, he notes how the Anglo teacher has to be attuned to cultural differences. Resident activists have made yearslong, contentious efforts to foil exploitative developers, as "the desire for jobs in a land with crushing unemployment collided with the urgency of preserving a sacred heritage."
What mainly defines the culture in Chinle, in Powell's eyes, is a resilience that he's careful not to sentimentalize. For the most part, the kids are just kids. The games, for Powell and Chinle alike, are at once an escape hatch and a glue for the community. And the mood lifts whenever Powell covers a game day. Life at a high-desert elevation has given the boys the endurance to compete, and once Mendoza's hectoring sinks in, the book becomes a gripping, propulsive story about a playoff run.
The basketball and cultural stories aren't parallel but braided, the problems woven around possibility. As a teacher tells Powell, "You never have to worry here about waking up in the morning and asking yourself, 'What am I doing here? What is my purpose?' "

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and host of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show," first cut his teeth in some of the area's smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100- to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000- to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed "The Loud & Clear Tour," is playing in arenas across the country, and comes to the Bay Area on Saturday.
"I've been lucky that California has been one of the places where I've had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following," Noah says during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping "The Daily Show" back in New York. "It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That's the only way I can look at this show (at Chase Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show."
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah says that's not what his comedy show is. He's said in previous interviews that he doesn't talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
"The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste," he says. "The Daily Show' is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I've been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they'll say Hey, I love your stand-up  I don't like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.' That's fine with me. I don't think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people," he says.
"I've always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends  I just want you to have a good time. It's not a show designed for one specific person, it's designed for everybody.
"It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too," he says. "People always ask me, How do you cope with Trump all the time?' It's not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that's 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that's more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don't have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too."
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he's a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, "The Beautiful Ones," which was released in late October. He also says that if he had to choose between either being on "The Masked Singer" or "Dancing With the Stars," he'd pick "The Masked Singer."
"Because I'd be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off," he says with a laugh. "I don't think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice."
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He obviously has a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book "Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood," became a New York Times best-seller and his "Son of Patricia" special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, which will take place Jan. 26 at Staples Center in Los Angeles.
"I live a very strange life in that I've never been too worried about the distant future," Noah says. "I just try to focus on what I'm doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I'm focused on is The Loud & Clear Tour' and The Daily Show,' just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that's all done, I'll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that's right in front of me."

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani just can't help himself.
Despite facing heat over his looming role in the Ukraine scandal, Giuliani (inset) was back in the European nation this week meeting with a trio of shady ex-prosecutors as part of his work on a right-wing documentary that aims to undermine the Democratic case for President Trump's impeachment, according to a report.
Sources familiar with the matter told The New York Times that Giuliani was in Kiev on Wednesday sitting down with former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin and recently fired prosecutor Kostiantyn Kulyk. Both men have pushed baseless corruption accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, stemming from the younger Biden's onetime seat on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
On Tuesday, the sources said, Giuliani was in Budapest meeting with Yuri Lutsenko, another former Ukrainian prosecutor who has become a key figure in the House impeachment inquiry over his involvement in pressing for Trump's eventual ouster of former U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.
All three ex-prosecutors are either currently or have previously been under investigation over allegations of corrupt activity.
Giuliani and his two criminally charged pals, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, were in contact with the sketchy Ukrainians in the spring as part of their dirt-digging on Trump's political opponents.
The former mayor is meeting with the former prosecutors to facilitate interviews for a documentary series he's working on for One America News, a pro-Trump news network that dabbles in debunked conspiracy theories, according to the sources.

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joe Biden announced 15 new endorsements from Puerto Rico today, including former Gov. Alejandro García Padilla.
Biden's 2020 presidential campaign calls the endorsements "the largest bipartisan slate of Puerto Rican endorsements in a primary election" and said they build on the support Biden has already received from Puerto Rican elected officials in Florida including state Rep. Amy Mercado, D-Orlando, and state Sen. Vic Torres, D-Kissimmee.
The officials include members of the island's Popular Democratic Party and New Progressive Party who affiliate with Democrats nationally.
The Puerto Rican population in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties is considered key to winning the important I-4 corridor. And in 2018, the number of Puerto Ricans eligible to vote in Florida began to equal that of the politically powerful Cuban-American population, according to a Pew Research Center report.
"Puerto Rico will play a defining role in the 2020 nominating contest," the campaign said in a statement. "With 59 delegates in play, the Vice President's strong show of support in Puerto Rico highlights not only the growing enthusiasm and excitement behind his policy, but the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to the future of the island."
Besides Padilla, other endorsements include former Sen. Zoé Laboy Alvarado, currently the chief of staff to Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced; Puerto Rican Sens. Carmelo Ríos Santiago and José Nadal Power; Ponce Mayor María "Mayita" Meléndez Altieri; San Lorenzo Mayor José Román Abreu; Guayanilla Mayor Nelson Torres Yordán; Federation of Puerto Rico College Democrats of America President José Roldán Villanueva; and Puerto Rico Reps. Rafael "Tatito" Hernández Montañez; Carlos A. Bianchi Angleró, José Aníbal Díaz Collazo, José "Conny" Varela Fernández, Javier Aponte Dalmau, José "Che" Pérez Cordero, and Angel Matos García.
Biden has held a steady lead over his Democratic rivals in most Florida polls, including the most recent major poll from New York Times/Siena in October that gave Biden 27% for an eight-point advantage over U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and a 14-point lead over U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.
Biden has made two appearances in Central Florida for fundraisers, in Heathrow in May and in Windermere in October.

SO FRESH, SO CLEAN: MUNCH GOES TO MOLA ON PENN AVE.

Texto completo: Among the better-known perks of writing about food include eating some wonderful paid-for meals, meeting terrific people, being asked for restaurant recommendations by every single person you know, buying larger pants and getting a Plavix prescription from your primary care physician.
One of the lesser-known perks: publishers across the nation routinely sending a library's worth of preview copies of food- and drink-related books with ridiculously specific titles like "Air Fryer Revolution," "Keto Comfort Foods," "The Noodle Soup Oracle," "All About Cake," "Weeknight Paleo," "Ready Set Dough!" and "A Table in Venice." You get the drift. Apparently, the print sector in everything else is dying but remains robust in esoteric cookbooks. Go figure.
That brings me to a recent arrival: "That Photo Makes Me Hungry: Photographing Food for Fun&Profit," by Andrew Scrivani. Mr. Scrivani, a photographer and director and a regular contributor to the New York Times food section, penned 184 accessible-to-amateurs pages on using light styling techniques, camera settings and storytelling through images, all punctuated by his beautiful and slobber-inducing food photography.
This should be required reading for any restaurateur with an Instagram account, because some of their photos are so bad, they might have the opposite of the desired effect and keep customers from coming through the door.
On the other hand, there's a place like Mola, on Penn Ave. in East Liberty, which consistently posts straight-up gorgeous images of its food that make you want to eat it through your phone screen. If the scale of #foodporn slides from something filthy good like a greasy slice of pizza or cross-section of a cheesesteak, this is more like some high-class food boudoir. Foodoir?
Opened at the beginning of this year by Mimi Lee and Alex Tang, a nephew of renowned Pittsburgh restaurateur Jimmy Wan, it's named for the Mola fish, aka the sunfish, a massive and goofy-looking bonefish - ironic as the food here is quite the opposite: elegant small plates, with nary a bone to be found.
If this place had a theme song, it would be "So Fresh, So Clean" by Outkast, because that's exactly what this photogenic fare is: so fresh and so clean (clean).
That starts with the sourcing, right down to the water they serve and use in dish preparation. They are the only restaurant in Pittsburgh to use a Vero filtration system, which is essentially the Aston Martin of water filters.
The decor is as clean and bright as the fish; the service warm and friendly. A mix of American craft and Japanese domestic beers are available, along with a nice wine selection and a slate of house cocktails and teas.
The menu of dumplings, bao and sushi is less about crazy rolls and sauces and more about simple fish and rice. The fish is shipped in from New York City's Fulton Fish Market in The Bronx, among other places. They use a high-grade koshihikari rice, real wasabi, and organic or grass-fed meats.
As sushi has evolved from exotic delicacy to supermarket staple, having a top-quality offering reminds of what makes it special. They do that very well at Mola, not only because of the premium fish but also with a unique combination of ingredients.
To wit: the Japanese sea bream and black truffle pate, hand-rolled in crispy nori - a meaty, clean fish with a sharp, earthy complement ($9). Or the salmon belly with sundried tomato and garlic - a perfect pop of flavor with a silky texture.
Then there was the Santa Barbara uni with blue crab hand roll. Flavorwise, this was a delicious lesson in HD subtlety: The savory, velvety, nutty uni went perfectly with the sweet crab meat ($10) in an expression of exquisite understatement.
Then there were the bao - soft steamed buns - of which each was better than the last, with an emphasis on balancing texture and flavor. The same can be said of the crispy chicken ($4), with breaded and baked organic chicken breast, slaw and sriracha mayo, or of the pork belly ($4), with braised pork belly, crushed peanuts, pickled cucumber and cilantro.
One small complaint was with the hot&spicy organic chicken bowl ($12). With ginger, scallions, garlic, sesame oil, dried chili and zucchini, it was healthy and filling, but neither hot nor spicy and surprisingly bland.
But that was the errant thumb on the lens of an otherwise picture-perfect pair of meals.

Texto completo: The deal with Mr. Cohen, a billionaire hedge fund manager, would represent a significant change in the New York sports landscape.
Steven A. Cohen, a minority investor in the Mets, is negotiating with the Wilpon family to purchase a controlling stake in the team, according to two people close to the negotiations.
A completed deal was not imminent and was still subject to approval by Major League Baseball owners, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. It would represent a huge change in the landscape of New York sports and for a beloved, if often troubled, franchise that the Wilpon family has owned a stake in since 1980.
It would also be the biggest step in the re-emergence of Mr. Cohen as a major player on the New York scene. Mr. Cohen, a billionaire who made his fortune in the hedge fund business, was a major figure in New York society and the art world when his fund became embroiled in a series of insider trading investigations that began after 2009. He was never charged with wrongdoing, but his firm ultimately paid nearly $ 2 billion in fines and he agreed not to manage outside money for two years.
Under the agreement being negotiated with the Wilpon family, Mr. Cohen, 63, would purchase 80 percent of the team, according to one of the people. In an announcement Wednesday about the negotiations, Mr. Cohen and the Mets said that Fred Wilpon, the current controlling owner of the Mets, and his son Jeff, the chief operating officer, who plays a role in nearly every decision the club makes, would remain in their positions for the next five years.
Judging from history, Mr. Cohen is unlikely to remain quiet during any interim period before he takes control of the team.
Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Mr. Cohen reigned as one of Wall Street's richest and most powerful hedge fund managers. He ran a $ 14 billion fund, S.A.C. Capital Advisors, that focused on stock trading and was organized to give individual portfolio managers maximum control. That left Mr. Cohen minimally responsible for their actions yet still able to share in their winnings. He kept his managers on notoriously short leashes, with poor or mediocre performances resulting in quick terminations. S.A.C.'s overall returns were exceptionally strong, year after year.
Mr. Cohen amassed personal wealth of more than $ 8 billion and built an eye-popping art collection, including works by Gerhard Richter, Jeff Koons and Roy Lichtenstein. Mr. Cohen tried to buy the Mets during those heady days, when the Wilpons became vulnerable because of their investments in Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme.
Mr. Cohen seldom spoke publicly, and rare glimpses into his thinking, gleaned mostly from court papers, revealed a brazen character who once lamented that insider trading rules were too "vague" to follow.
A shy father of seven, Mr. Cohen long ruled his multibillion-dollar hedge fund from a workstation in the middle of a sprawling suburban Connecticut trading floor. Bespectacled and favoring half-zip fleeces, Mr. Cohen has long been known as a workaholic, holding investment meetings on Sunday evenings and personally weighing in on big trades. In recent years, he began to groom his next generation of portfolio managers and became more visibly involved in philanthropy, donating tens of millions of dollars to benefit the mental health of veterans and giving $ 50 million to the Museum of Modern Art.
Mr. Cohen's first troubles with insider trading allegations occurred in 1986, when officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned him about his trades in shares of RCA ahead of an announcement that RCA would be bought by General Electric. During the interview with S.E.C. officials, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination several times, according to a Reuters report, which cited a transcript of the deposition. His ex-wife, Patricia Cohen, later claimed in a lawsuit that he had used proceeds from those trades to start S.A.C. Capital.
Federal prosecutors, foremost among them Preet Bharara, then the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, combed through the records of Mr. Cohen's fund two decades later, hoping to catch him in an illegal act. They wiretapped his phones, but he quickly found out about the surveillance.
He became a version of the white whale to Mr. Bharara's Ahab, and in 2013, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against S.A.C. -- not Mr. Cohen personally. He paid $ 1.8 billion to settle the charges and was not able to manage other people's money from 2016 to '18. After selling off a chunk of his giant art collection for $ 88 million and changing his Greenwich, Conn., firm's name to Point72 Asset Management, Mr. Cohen retreated.
Until recently. His ban on managing outside funds expired last year. He had already reopened a shuttered London office. He battled a sex discrimination lawsuit against his firm, which was accused of underpaying female employees and condoning crude behavior toward women. The case was sent to private arbitration.
Now, seven years after he pursued a purchase of the Los Angeles Dodgers and paid $ 20 million for a small share of the Mets, Mr. Cohen is on the verge of gaining the kind of exposure that comes only with owning a major sports franchise in a world capital at a time when team owners, such as Mark Cuban, are among the country's biggest celebrities.
Mr. Cohen currently owns 8 percent of the team, according to one of the people who spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity. He purchased his share after the collapse of an announced $ 200 million sale of a minority stake in the team to the hedge fund manager David Einhorn.
Mr. Cohen grew up in Great Neck on Long Island, about a dozen miles and a quick train ride from Flushing Meadows, the Mets' home since Shea Stadium opened in 1964. Citi Field, their current stadium, opened in 2009.
Fred Wilpon, a Brooklyn native and devout Brooklyn Dodgers fan as a child, played baseball and basketball at Lafayette High School with Sandy Koufax, the Hall of Fame pitcher. A real estate developer who founded Sterling Enterprises with his brother-in-law in 1972, he acquired a 1 percent stake of the Mets in 1980 when Doubleday, a publishing company, bought the team.
Mr. Wilpon became an equal partner in the team's ownership in 1986 and bought the remaining 50 percent in 2002 for about $ 135 million. A sale would pre-empt a potential squabble among Mr. Wilpon's children and their cousins over control of the team and allow him to continue giving away a significant portion of his fortune. He is a major donor to the University of Michigan and many other charities.
The Mets have won just one championship during his tenure, in 1986. The team lost in the World Series in 2000 and 2015, and the Wilpons have been criticized for not being willing to spend enough to lure top players. The Mets ranked 12th in the major leagues in total payroll for the 2019 season.
According to a person familiar with the Mets finances, the franchise has lost tens of millions of dollars in recent years as it struggled to attract fans to a team that often fell out of the playoff race in midseason. The Mets finished the 2019 season with an 86-76 record, failing to make the playoffs for the 11th time in 13 seasons. They fired their manager, Mickey Callaway, days after the season ended and last month hired Carlos Beltran, who played with the Mets for seven seasons, as Mr. Callaway's replacement.

Texto completo: Live up to our values In a whirlwind news week involving blockbuster impeachment hearings and a Democratic debate, The New York Times’ publication of the Community Party of China’s (CPC) internal documents was left by the wayside. Party documents regarding China’s brutal government-sponsored crackdown of ethnic minorities in China’s interior Xinjian region are shocking. Austin Ramzy and Chris Buckley detail the plight of college students returning home to find their families have vanished and veiled threats from party officials to keep their mouths shut. Other reports out of Xinjiang have highlighted worrisome facts, including over a million Uighurs in concentration camps, organ harvesting, forced quartering of communists in Uighur homes and massive surveillance.
As Americans, we understand that the role of the United States as a global leader requires us to lead by example on all issues, especially those of human rights, diplomacy and international engagement. As history has shown, when the United States leads, the world follows. As history has also unfortunately shown, when we step back, when America stands silent as atrocities are committed, the world also remains silent. We saw this in Rwanda, we saw this in Darfur and unfortunately, we are seeing this again in China and Burma. As people of conscience, we cannot allow this to happen.
Recently, the Senate passed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 in a bipartisan manner, and both Senators Durbin and Duckworth voted for the bill. I thank the senators for their votes, and I ask members of Illinois’ congressional delegation to encourage Speaker Pelosi to bring the bill to the House floor.
Standing up for what’s right is our responsibility as a people of conscience. Let’s live up to our values.
Omer A. Rehman Aurora Will senators see reason?
The Washington Post reports that to date, Trump has lied or misled us over 13,435 times since he took office roughly 1,000 days ago. Trump surrounded himself with the likes of Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. They have all been convicted in a court of law, with more likely to follow. It seems they like to lie.
So, when credible (might I say impressive?) patriotic members of our foreign service testify in the impeachment hearings, under oath, to the fact that Trump committed a crime, who do you believe? To anyone past the age of reason, the choice is pretty obvious.
Now, all we have to do is wait to see if the Republican senators have reached the age of reason or not.

The Broward County Public Library Foundation's biggest event of the year is the Literary Feast, but the organization plans book events year-round. The popular Book With Brunch continues with historian and novelist Les Standiford discussing "Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, and the Rise of America's Xanadu" (Atlantic Monthly Press) at 10:30 a.m. Dec. 5 at ArtServe, 1350 E.

Literary events
at the Levis JCC
Literary events continue at the Adolph & Rose Levis Jewish Community Center's Sandler Center, 21050 95th Avenue S., Boca Raton. For information or register for both events, contact 561-558-2520 or levisjcc.org/sandler.
Ralph Nurnberger discusses his "Life in A Jar: How Irena Sendler Saved the Children of the Warsaw Ghetto," the story of social worker Irena Sendler, who saved children's lives by convincing their parents to give them up. She then had them adopted into Polish families or hid them in convents and orphanages.

Nurnberger's presentation is at 7:30 p.m. Dec. 10. Cost is $25.
The JCC's "Literary Afternoon Series" includes appearances by authors discussing their works and creative process. Cost is $25 for individual programs or $110 for the entire series that continues through March.
Cooking with character
Cookbooks written by mystery writers are gaining in popularity, especially with the success of "Goldy's Kitchen Cookbook: Cooking, Writing, Family, Life" by Diane Mott Davidson; "The Cozy Cookbook: More than 100 Recipes from Today's Bestselling Mystery Authors" edited by Julie Hyzy, Laura Childs and Cleo Coyle; and "The Mystery Writers of America Cookbook: Wickedly Good Meals and Desserts to Die For" edited by Kate White.
Plantation author Nancy Cohen joins that group with her "A Bad Hair Day Cookbook." But Cohen says she didn't write the cookbook - her character Marla Shores did and Cohen just helped. Well, Cohen did more than help.
"I've collected so many recipes over the years and kept making my favorite dishes that I would post pictures on Facebook and recipes on my website," Cohen wrote in an email. "I like dining out, talking about food, and taking cooking classes. So, I decided to compile my recipes into a cookbook. As a tribute to my fans, I added commentary and tips from Marla's viewpoint. A special entry was written by my mother (now deceased)." Cohen has written 17 novels featuring Marla, her hairstylist sleuth. She said the cookbook also is a legacy to her children and new grandson.
Cohen will discuss "A Bad Hair Day Cookbook," joined by Florida author Alyssa Maxwell talking about her novel "Murder at Crossways," at 1 p.m. Dec. 8 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com. Light refreshments including an appetizer and a "spirited" cake will be served, Cohen said.
Poetry workshops, readings
"Hermit crab poetry" was coined in the late 1990s to mean borrowing forms from other disciplines, such as dictionary entries, instruction manuals and tarot cards as containers for content. The Palm Beach Poetry Festival holds its workshop "Playing the Shell Game: Hermit Crab Poetry" at 1 p.m. Dec. 7 at Old School Square Crest Theatre, 51 N. Swinton Ave., Delray Beach, 561-243-7922. Cost is $10 per person. Poet and FIU creative writing professor Julie Marie Wade will lead the workshop.
"Bards of a Feather," an open-mic round robin poetry reading, begins at 1 p.m. Dec. 12 at the Hagen Ranch Library Meeting Room, 14350 Hagen Ranch Road, Delray Beach, 561-894-7000. Participants should bring up to four poems, original or not, to share during this free event. The festival's Senior Poetry Project wraps up the year reading holiday poems and singing at 10:30 a.m. Dec. 17 at the Sunrise Assisted Living, Brighton Gardens, 6341 Via De Sonrisa Del Sur, Boca Raton. Volunteers are welcome.
Meanwhile, the 16th annual Palm Beach Poetry Festival will be held Jan. 20-25 at Old School Square in Delray Beach. The festival will feature top poets at numerous ticketed public events, including readings, talks, interviews, panel discussions and workshops. For more information about any of these events, visit www.palmbeachpoetryfestival.org.

Chaudhry discusses her critically acclaimed novel at noon Dec. 18 at Temple Israel, 137 NE 19th St., Miami. Chaudhry's presentation continues the Brickell Avenue Literary Society's monthly luncheons, which brings in top authors to discuss their work. The series continues through March.

How not to write
Barbara Flores, a designer and cookbook author, gives a humorous look at marriage in "Separated, Acting Badly: A Bi-Cultural Memoir," which she says shows "how not to write a memoir." When her husband left her for a younger woman, Flores geared up to save her 30-year marriage. Of course, everyone she knew, both friends and relatives, had different advice for her, including luring him back with homemade enchiladas, rosary petitions and even witchcraft. Flores will discuss her book at 4 p.m. Dec. 7 at Murder on the Beach Mystery Bookstore, 104 W. Atlantic Ave., Delray Beach, 561-279-7790, murderonthebeach.com.
Deadline is Dec. 20 for the January events roundup. Email olinecog@aol.com.

Texto completo: As viral pets such as Lil Bub pass away, the heart-eyes emoji we once shared are replaced with crying ones
Lil Bub became famous in her youth, at the beginning of the decade, when a picture of her went viral on Reddit. She was a permakitten with bulging eyes and a tongue that always stuck out. Her owner, Mike Bridavsky, made a Tumblr account for her in late 2011, according to a Spin profile of the cat. He never expected it to blow up, but people found her unusual physical features to be irresistible.
But Lil Bub wasn't just a cute meme; she was a mortal creature, and more fragile than most. The runt of her litter, Lil Bub had health problems all her life. Scientists sequenced her genome to uncover information about her 'magical' appearance. She most recently had a bone infection. And on Monday, Bridavsky wrote to her fans with sad news: Lil Bub had died in her sleep. 'We lost the purest, kindest and most magical living force on our planet,' he wrote. Bridavsky had been sharing updates on her bone condition over the past few weeks, but he admitted that he wasn't expecting her to pass so suddenly.
It was a jarring death, even from afar. Lil Bub was the subject of a documentary, made celebrity appearances and was one of the most recognizable cats in the world. Just days ago, her social media accounts were promoting a Black Friday merch sale to her millions of followers.
Lil Bub's death was trending on Twitter within minutes of the announcement as fans of the cat and friends of her owner, as well as other viral animal accounts, wrote tributes.
Although famous animals predate the Internet, Lil Bub's life and fame coincided with the online flourishing of the influencer pet, and her passing is part of a parallel phenomenon: widespread grief when those pets inevitably die.
Boo, the cute, smiling Pomeranian with 16 million followers on Facebook, died in January. He was 12.
Boo, the dog's owners wrote on Facebook at the time, never got over the death of his friend and fellow famous dog Buddy. 'We think his heart literally broke when Buddy left us,' the post read. 'He hung on and gave us over a year.'
Grumpy Cat died this year, at 7-years old, after becoming the dour face of a feline empire of merch, media and entertainment. Grumpy Cat 'produced' a New York Times bestseller. Grumpy Cat did commercials and even starred in 'Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever.'
Keyboard Cat, an orange tabby whose given name was Bento, died last year of liver cancer. Bento had become famous as a stand-in for his owner's previous cat, Fatso, the keyboard-'playing' star of an old home movie that went viral on YouTube many years after Fatso himself had passed away.
In a way, the deaths of Fatso and Bento mark two sides of cultural history: the first Keyboard Cat, whose original 'feat' was captured with analog media and confined to a VHS tape, died without fanfare; the second Keyboard Cat, whose celebrity came as the result of sudden, random viral fame in the YouTube age, created national news when he died.
Viral pets have become part of the social media feeds of any animal lover with a social media account, and their deaths have mark significant disruptions even when they don't rate obituaries in the mainstream news.
There was Nana, the rescue senior pit bull with 170,000 Instagram followers, who died in November. Tillman the Skateboarding Dog died in 2015. Eddie the Lilac Lion, a toothless, earless cat who charmed thousands on Instagram, died in 2018. Luigi the cat attended the 2018 burial of his friend Bandito the pug, with whom he shared an Instagram account with more than 100,000 followers. Colonel Meow died in 2014. The death of Caspar, an Instagram cat with a modest following, prompted the Cut to publish a meditation following the last days of a cat's life online.
Gabe the Dog's 'borks' inspired YouTube remixes for years until his owner announced in 2017 that Gabe had died of heart problems.
The animal Internet of the 2000s was filled with amusing cat pictures. The Internet of the 2010s has been a place for cat and dog empires. Internet cat and dog cultures have their own online languages, media outlets and political controversies. Watching the lives of other people's pets has become a part of the Internet experience, and now so has mourning their deaths.
Happily, this decade has not seen the demise of all the beloved Internet pets. Despite many rumors to the contrary over the past few years, Kabosu, the shiba inu who became the face of the Doge meme, is alive and well, according to her Instagram.

Texto completo: A Maori man attacked a statue to raise awareness of his ancestors' pain. A newspaper covered the story, and a very important reader took action: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
HAMILTON, New Zealand -- An 80-year-old Maori man walked up to a statue of a colonial-era British naval commander one winter morning in 2018, a can of paint and a claw hammer in his hands.
"The red paint was to change the way he looked, and the hammer was to break his nose," said the man, Taitimu Maipi.
Mr. Maipi's small act of vandalism in the city of Hamilton, New Zealand, was intended to be a reminder of the pain that white settlers inflicted on the Indigenous Maori people. It ended up forcing a national reckoning over historical memory and cultural identity that paralleled in many ways the upheaval a year before in Charlottesville, Va.
The attack in Hamilton drew extensive coverage in the local newspaper. Residents responded with letters denouncing the vandalism. And the conversation caught the eye of one longtime reader: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
In September, Ms. Ardern announced that the national school curriculum would be changed to require lessons on the 19th-century New Zealand Land Wars, in which British troops killed more than 2,000 Maori.
"I did not see that coming," Mr. Maipi, a longtime activist, said recently as he stood beside the bronze statue of Capt. John Hamilton, which remains in the middle of Hamilton's downtown square.
In a different time, the seemingly minor gesture of protest -- after the attack, Mr. Maipi stopped by City Hall to leave his contact information and later got off with a police warning -- might have been quickly forgotten. But his defiant action came not long after the deadly white supremacist violence in Charlottesville over the planned removal of a Confederate statue.
"I think it's all connected," said Aaron Leaman, a reporter for The Waikato Times, which published a series of articles as part of a campaign to bring more of New Zealand's history into its schools. "I don't think what happened here could be seen in isolation."
After Mr. Maipi's vandalism, some New Zealanders called for the statue's removal because of the role of Captain Hamilton -- for whom the city is named, though he never set foot there -- in the deaths of Maori during the Land Wars, which raged from 1845 to 1872.
Those bloody conflicts broke out after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 between the colonial government and the Maori. Disputes over land sales grew into major campaigns to confiscate territory and reinforce British sovereignty.
Community upheaval followed these assaults against the Maori, and more than 100 years later, they still lag on many social measures like income and life expectancy, though the government has worked to close the gap. New Zealand is still paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement claims related to the treaty.
"I just wanted to expose the fact that this statue shouldn't be here," Mr. Maipi said. "I wanted to break something," he added. "I really meant what I did."
Captain Hamilton, he said, "was a murderer."
"There's a lot of pain there for people who were part of those wars," he added.
Other citizens -- many of them older, white residents who wrote letters to the editor -- complained about the damage to public property and argued that removing the statue would be akin to erasing history. Some used racist language.
"A lot of people were saying this is terrible, destroying public property, and we were saying, come on people, there's a lot of history behind this, and there aren't a lot of Maori statues or any kind of acknowledgment of their role," said Jonathan MacKenzie, the editor in chief of The Waikato Times.
"Clearly, the people reading had little understanding of the country's past, and what they knew was based on the wrong information," Mr. MacKenzie added.
While some of the bigoted statements might have been ignored in the past, said Mr. Leaman, the reporter, such views now command greater attention after the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch.
"It's easy to brush them off as fringe," he said, "but after Christchurch, we take hate speech more seriously."
The newsroom decided to work to educate its readership, Mr. MacKenzie said. "We thought, why don't we do some stories on people who fought on the Maori side of the war; they'd be passed down orally," he said.
The effort would build on a push by two nearby schools to make teaching of the Land Wars compulsory. Currently, New Zealand history is an elective in school, and the Land Wars aren't part of the curriculum at all.
"We thought we could really put some pressure on and act as a bit of an amplifier," Mr. MacKenzie said.
The journalists didn't imagine that the stories would get much notice. But they hadn't anticipated the attention of a prime minister who keeps an eye on the city of her birth.
The Waikato Times's campaign "stood out to me because I know the region well and because it's a view I've held for some time," Ms. Ardern said in an email to The New York Times.
She announced two months ago that changes to the national curriculum for both primary and secondary schools would be made within the next three years.
Ms. Ardern said the public reaction had been "incredible and far-reaching. I think a lot of that stems from a desire from New Zealanders to know more about their own country's history, our land and our people."
Mr. Maipi said that New Zealanders had been better at commemorating foreign wars, like World War I, than they had been at acknowledging local history, because of the cost to the Maori.
"We need to educate the country that this happened; we need to educate our children," he said. He added: "The story will be told by the children. Unless you tell the children, it will die."
The newly elected mayor of Hamilton, Paula Southgate, is waiting on a report that will assess the street names and statues throughout the city that might be culturally offensive to the Maori. She expects it to recommend moving the statue of Captain Hamilton.
"If there's something that's blatantly culturally insensitive, you need to address it and be respectful about that," she said.

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

Texto completo: You can’t make this stuff up.
Niceness and respectfulness guru Donald John (“Grab ‘em by the Pussy”) Trump has denounced as “nasty” and “disrespectful” comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron about NATO.
Trump was offended, not on his own behalf, mind you, but on behalf of his beloved organization NATO, to which he has done so much to promote respect and loyalty, by Macron’s comment that NATO was suffering a kind of “brain death.”
In rising to the defense of NATO and taking offense on its behalf (and, of course, entirely on its behalf alone) his excellency the POTUS did not clarify that the “brain death” to which Macron had metaphorically alluded was brought about by the unprecedented disrespect shown to NATO by said POTUS himself.
Here’s the Washington Post coverage of Trump’s reaction to Macron’s remark, and here’s the New York Times’.

More fuel: Trump calls Macron ‘a deceitful little guy’

Texto completo: President Trump’s slap at French President Emmanuel Macron during today’s NATO summit for his “nasty” suggestion that the alliance is faltering is a continuation of the American’s view that the Frenchman can be a pill.
In a relationship that the media has built up with the help of the president’s team, Trump actually isn’t a big fan and seems to distrust Macron’s politics.
Britain NATO
In the new and authorized biography, Inside Trump's White House: The Real Story of His Presidency, New York Times best-selling author Doug Wead revealed Trump’s impression of the French leader during a question-and-answer session for the book.
415BteOP6PL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpgWead quoted key officials describing the relationship as good as they described the April 2018 State visit of Macron and his wife Brigitte.
During the visit, Macron hoped to get Trump to reverse his plans to junk the Paris climate accords, the Obama-era deal with Iran, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Noting Macron’s focus on big issues and his relationship with Trump, a key official said, “Macron has the potential to be a great leader for Europe.”
But, Wead continued, “Trump made it clear that he was unimpressed with his French counterpart. I asked him how he would describe Macron. And he answered with one word: ‘Deceitful.’”
Later today, Wead told Washington Secrets that in the transcript of the interview, Trump actually said, “He is a deceitful little guy.”
Trump’s criticism at the NATO summit today came after Macron had called the alliance’s strategy “brain dead.”
Said Trump, “I think that's very insulting,” and he added that it was a “very, very nasty statement.”
But by the afternoon and at a late meeting at No. 10 Downing St., the air had cleared, and Trump not only complimented France but gave the French president a ride to the British prime minister’s residence.

Texto completo: President Trump's reelection campaign has banned Bloomberg News from covering its rallies and other public events, citing what it calls a biased coverage policy by the media company of one of his Democratic rivals.
The news organization, owned by billionaire and presidential candidate Michael R. Bloomberg, has declared it will not investigate the former New York mayor or any of his fellow Democrats vying for the party's 2020 presidential nomination -- but will continue to investigate Trump.
"The decision by Bloomberg News to formalize preferential reporting policies is troubling and wrong," Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement.

He called on Bloomberg to rescind its policy, saying most news organizations "don't announce their biases so publicly."
"Since they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events," Parscale said. "We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis."
John Micklethwait, Bloomberg News editor in chief, defended the decision.
"The accusation of bias couldn't be further from the truth," he said. "We have covered Donald Trump fairly and in an unbiased way since he became a candidate in 2015 and will continue to do so despite the restrictions imposed by the Trump campaign."
Bloomberg launched his candidacy last week -- months after announcing that he had decided not to run.
Howard Wolfson, a senior political advisor to Bloomberg, said on Twitter: "One week in and Mike is already under Trump'[s] skin."
During much of his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump refused to give media credentials to the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico and other outlets whose coverage he disliked. Reporters got around the blacklisting by entering his rallies with the public. Trump lifted the ban two months before the election.
The Trump campaign's decision drew a rebuke from Dean Baquet, executive editor of the New York Times. "We condemn any action that keeps quality news media from reporting fairly and accurately on the presidency and the leadership of the country," he said.

Texto completo: The company, accused by the E.U. of stifling competition, is trying a tool in Ireland that would allow users to move photos and videos to Google.
LONDON -- Facebook is trying to make it easier for users to move photos from the social network to rival online services, reacting to European privacy laws and criticism from regulators that its size and control over data hinder competition.
On Monday, Facebook said it would begin testing a "data portability" tool in Ireland that would allow users there to move photos and videos from Facebook to Google Photos. Critics immediately said the initiative did not go far enough.
Facebook's control over personal data has been central to current antitrust investigations in Washington and Europe. Authorities say Facebook holds so much information about its users, data it uses to fuel its digital advertising business and improve its services, that it creates a competitive imbalance that rivals can't match.
The company has long benefited from so-called network effects, where the value of its services increases as more people join. But many users have felt they can't leave Facebook because transferring photos and videos elsewhere was too difficult. To foster more competition, officials have debated how to make companies let users take their content and data to other services.
Facebook is starting the project in Ireland with Google, hardly a small upstart, but said it would expand it to other photo services and other parts of the world by June.
Facebook said the photo-moving service was a result of discussions with officials in countries including Brazil, Britain, Germany and Singapore.
"We've learned from our conversations with policymakers, regulators, academics, advocates and others that real-world use cases and tools will help drive policy discussions forward," the company said in a blog post.
A Google spokesman said the company had offered data portability tools since 2007, and he pointed to the company's founding role in the Data Transfer Project, which enables direct platform-to-platform portability.
Critics responded quickly, saying more must be done to crimp Facebook's power. The European Union's privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, already requires Facebook and other companies to make data portable to other services.
Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at the University College London, said a better way to encourage competition would be to allow non-Facebook users to interact with those who were on the social network, for actions like messaging and organizing events.
"Being able to port your data does not threaten Facebook," said Mr. Veale, who has filed a privacy complaint against Facebook in Europe for not giving him access to data that the network holds about him.
Martin Husovec, an assistant professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who has written about data portability, said authorities were debating whether to require Facebook to make more of its real-time data available to competitors. In Britain, regulators now require banks to provide access to certain financial data, allowing smaller companies to offer digital banking services that are becoming popular with customers.
"Data gives companies power. That's why it becomes an important resource," Mr. Husovec said. "If you force a company to share the information, perhaps you reduce the competitive advantage and level the playing field."
Agustín Reyna, the chief competition officer for the European Consumer Organization, a consumer-rights group, said Facebook's announcement was a "halfway solution."
"The market of social networks is far too concentrated partly because of the strong network effects which lock in consumers within Facebook's ecosystem," he said. "The fact that you might be able to transfer your pictures to another service will not change that situation."
Control of data has become a central issue in the antitrust debate about the power of the world's largest technology platforms. Authorities in the United States and Europe have been exploring whether companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google use data to box out competitors.
Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust regulator, said last week that the use of data could provide many benefits, "but not if that data is monopolized by a few companies, and used to drive out competition."

Navajo country music pays tribute to ‘Indian cowboys’ and outlaw legends

Texto completo: Shiprock, N.M. • They started out from hamlets deep in the Navajo Nation, driving hours on washboard roads. When the Saturday night crowd finally arrived at Redd’s, the parking lot swelled with pickup trucks.
Clad in Wrangler jeans and cowboy boots, they danced under the dim lights to bands playing outlaw country classics by singers such as Waylon Jennings. Between songs, couples murmured sweet nothings to each other in English and Diné Bizaad, the Navajo language enduring in this part of the West.
“I’m not silversmithing or painting but the music I make is still a kind of art,” said Travis Mose, 42, the vocalist for The Wanderers, a Navajo country band whose musicians drove two hours from Halchita, Utah, to perform that recent night in Shiprock. “This music touches our people inside.”
At highway honky-tonks, casino lounges and far-flung dance halls, a form of music that many associate with rural white America is flourishing in the heart of Indian country. Dozens of bands vie for shows on the circuit each week, reflecting how one of the largest tribes in the U.S. is shattering long-held stereotypes of “cowboys and Indians.”
This reshuffling of identities is part of country music’s malleable reach around the world, as country scenes prosper in places as varied as Brazil, Iran and Kenya.
While other Native American tribes have long put their own stamp on country music, none have done so quite like the Navajo, who have forged a constantly changing genre that chronicles life on the reservation and beyond.
One factor nurturing the music’s vibrancy here is the sheer size of the Navajo Nation, spreading over 27,000 square miles in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The Diné, as many Navajo prefer to call themselves, number more than 330,000 on reservation lands and beyond.
Such numbers provide critical mass for a musical culture that reflects both life within the reservation and in surrounding “border towns.” Browse through the tribe’s enrolled members, and one finds names like Wynonna Begay (reminiscent of country singer Wynonna Judd) or Garth Yazzie (a nod to country star Garth Brooks.)
Diné-speaking DJs on radio stations like KTNN broadcast country songs across an area larger than West Virginia. Throughout the reservation, ranching skills like sheep butchering and bronco and bull riding are prized.
Defining just what comprises Navajo country music depends on who’s talking. Generally speaking, the genre draws from a canon by country legends including Merle Haggard and Buck Owens — more tilted, perhaps, to the Southwest than Nashville — sometimes blending Diné phrases into the songs.
Teachers, sheep ranchers, construction workers and others with day jobs make up most bands. They largely play covers, paying tribute not just to outlaw country singers but to legendary Diné country bands like the Wingate Valley Boys and the Navajo Sundowners.
The musicians often make do without managers or road crews, arranging their own shows and driving themselves across vast expanses to their next performance.
Some well-known groups like Stateline, from White Cone, Arizona, whose members support themselves full time by playing as many as four shows a week, also compose their own music.
In their song “Grandpa’s Pickup Truck,” Stateline draws on the Diné word for grandfather, shicheii, for a wistful portrait of the back roads that crisscross the Navajo Nation:
“I was happy as a sinner going back to heaven,
Climbing in the front of my shicheii’s pickup truck,
With Cheetos and Shasta sitting in the middle,
Driving down the old reservation road.”
Kristina Jacobsen, a bilagáana (Anglo, in a rough translation) anthropologist at the University of New Mexico, said that Navajo country music is often intended to sound “tinny and imperfect,” emulating the gritty low-tech sound of bands from decades past.
“They’re singing about mama, trucks, ranching, nostalgia, things the Navajo happen to know a lot about,” said Jacobsen, who learned Diné and played with reservation bands while researching her book, “The Sound of Navajo Country.”
“But remember, this is dance music,” she said.
Even for those who can two-step, the scene can be challenging for outsiders to access, involving Navajo bands often playing for predominantly Navajo audiences.
One recent night at Sports Page, a dive bar in the border town of Gallup in western New Mexico, the cover charge was $2 to see Full Country Band, a veteran Navajo country ensemble from Tohatchi, New Mexico.
Inside the cramped venue, couples swirled for hours on the dance floor as the Stetson-clad musicians belted out classics. Photographs and interviews by outsiders were not allowed, the manager of Sports Page said.
Some who are open to talking explain that country music may be a natural fit for a people who have long harnessed traditions from other cultures, adapting them so thoroughly that they become Navajo.
The long arc of Diné history in the Southwest offers clues as to how this adaptive capacity was honed.
Some Diné creation stories suggest that their ancestors entered the world near Huérfano Mesa, a sacred site in northwestern New Mexico. But Diné scholars suggest that it was the merging of various indigenous groups in the Southwest that produced the Navajo people, with Diné Bizaad emerging centuries ago as a regional lingua franca.
Such accounts provide a more complex picture of Diné origins than commonly held assumptions that the Navajo are relative newcomers, thought to have arrived in the Southwest sometime between 1100 and 1500 as part of an Athabaskan migration that also included Apache tribes from what is now Canada.
Either way, Diné honed a capacity for adapting aspects of other cultures. After the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, the Diné took to herding churro sheep, the Iberian breed introduced by conquistadors well-suited for rugged Navajo lands.
With the horse, another animal introduced by the Spanish, the Navajo developed a ranching ethos long before Anglo cowboys arrived on the scene. Diné ropers, bareback riders and steer wrestlers are now competing in rodeos around the U.S.
“To put it simply, we’re the original cowboys,” said Travis Friday, 40, the leader of Stateline the band from Arizona. “Now we walk this line between Anglo ways and our own culture. You could say our music tries to bridge worlds a little.”
Country is still far from being the only musical form thriving among the Navajo. Diné musicians nurture heavy metal, punk and rap scenes. In Farmington, the largest city in the Four Corners region, the DJ at the club in the Brentwood Hotel plays hip-hop for a largely Navajo crowd.
Still, the real action is on Farmington’s outskirts at the Navajo-controlled Northern Edge Casino, where “rez bands,” as many Diné call country ensembles, perform on weekends.
“They keep the rhythm just right for people to dance,” said Vonn Nelson, 40, a grandmother from the outpost of Pueblo Pintado who drove to Farmington on a recent night to see Stateline.
Nelson said that country music was so present in her family’s life that her 2-year-old grandson, Mikey, was already learning the two-step. “We start them young,” she proudly added.
Lee Griffith, 22, is also from a rural part of the Navajo Nation but now lives in Farmington, where he cares for his mother. He said he had come to Stateline’s show to forget about a tragedy from just days earlier: His grandparents were killed in a car crash.
“This music gets me moving, singing, out of my myself,” said Griffith, a country music enthusiast who lists new stars like Easton Corbin and Luke Bryan among his favorite performers. “I didn’t want to dwell on things tonight. I just wanted to dance.”

Biden overstates ‘Medicare for All’ opposition

Texto completo: When the subject of “Medicare for All” came up during the Democratic debate last week, former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that the majority of his party does not favor it.
“The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All,” he said, adding, “It couldn’t pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn’t pass the House.”
Public opinion
The Biden campaign initially directed us to news coverage of a January 2019 Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll, which noted that the majority of Americans generally oppose Medicare for All if they hear arguments that frame the program as requiring Americans to pay more taxes or leading to delays in testing and treatment.
On the flip side, though, when — in the same poll — Medicare for All was described as guaranteeing health insurance as a right for all Americans, or that it would eliminate health insurance premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs, the majority favored the national health plan.
But those results reflected the views of all Americans, not just Democrats. The same poll broke down respondents’ answers by political party and showed that 81% of Democrats favored creating a national health plan.
The KFF Health Tracking Poll, done monthly, indicates Democrats’ support for Medicare for All has weakened, but not entirely. Its most recent version, published in November, revealed large majorities of Democrats support a public option (88%) and Medicare for All (77%). KFF’s January 2019 tracking poll has 85% of Democrats favoring a Medicare buy-in.
Other polls show similar results: support for Medicare for All among Democrats but stronger support for the incremental approaches Biden backs.
Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said he thinks Biden’s statement rings true based on a poll he helped conduct, in partnership with the Commonwealth Fund and The New York Times.
Rather than asking survey respondents if they favored Medicare for All, the survey asked them to choose among Medicare for All, improving the existing ACA or replacing the ACA with state health plans.
For registered Democrats, the results were close between two of the proposals: 46% preferred Medicare for All and 45% preferred improving the existing ACA. Only 7% preferred replacing the ACA with state health plans. In this survey, Medicare for All was not preferred by a majority of Democrats.
But Blendon noted that survey respondents often will say yes to a “one-off question” about whether they support something and that answer can change once they have to choose among options, such as in his organization’s survey.
Congressional support and another context
Horwitt also made the point that it wasn’t clear in Biden’s statement which group of people he was referencing.
“I recall hearing the statement in real-time, but in looking now at just the statement from Biden below, it is unclear to me if he is talking about elected Democrats or Democratic voters when he references the “vast majority,” Horwitt wrote via email.
While the Biden campaign did direct us to public opinion polls, they also pointed out that the Senate and House Medicare for All bills are “only sponsored by a fraction of the members of the respective Democratic caucuses that would be needed to secure passage.”
The Senate Medicare for All bill, introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, has 14 co-sponsors, while the House’s Medicare for All bill, introduced by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, has 118 co-sponsors.
(There are currently 233 Democrats in the House and 45 Democrats plus two independents in the Senate.)
Our ruling
During the recent presidential primary debates, Biden said: “The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for All.”
Based on a cursory review of polls, this statement appears off-base. After all, most polls find that when Democrats are simply asked if they support Medicare for All, they answer “yes.”
However, when those same polls dig deeper into this support by asking about the favorability of other Democratic-favored health policies, this support becomes weaker.
For these reasons, we rate this statement Mostly False.

FOES: IT IS HAIRSE!; Gray area in law allows Catholic schools to keep bans vs. traditional black hairstyles

Texto completo: A hair-raising loophole in city and state laws meant to crack down on cultural discrimination has actually allowed bans on braids in more than a dozen Catholic schools, according to legal records.
The same city law that recently fined an Upper East Side salon a whopping $70,000 for discouraging its black employees from wearing natural hairstyles is turning the other cheek when it comes to Catholic classrooms, and critics say the double standard is anything but divine.
"It makes me very uneasy that the [New York] archdiocese is not going to step in and encourage all of their schools to be compliant with state law," said Assemblywoman Tremaine Wright (D-Brooklyn), who helped draft the recently passed state Crown Act banning discrimination against natural hair, which disproportionately singles out black men and women.
When Wright helped craft the law, she fully expected it would apply to Catholic schools.
But the law, which Gov. Cuomo signed in July, along with the city's version from February, has not been enforced in at least 14 of New York City's Catholic schools, where handbooks spell out bans on natural hair as clearly as the Bible's book of Exodus spells out the Ten Commandments.
"No cultural preferences will be allowed, such as boys with braided hair," said a handbook from Christ the King School in the Bronx, which serves elementary and middle-school students.
St. John's School, also in the Bronx, listed a prohibition against "corn rolls," even though the appropriate term is "cornrows."
Eleven other schools in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx also listed the ban, often calling braids a "fad" or "inappropriate" hairstyle for boys, though three schools reached by the Daily News said they no longer enforce the restrictions.
The bans fall into legal loopholes that may keep them out of reach of the new city and state rules, said David Bloomfield, a professor of education law at Brooklyn College and CUNY Graduate Center.
The state Dignity for All Students Act, which governs discrimination in schools, includes the caveat: "Nothing in this article shall ... apply to private, religious or denominational educational institutions," while the city human rights law exempts any "religious corporation incorporated under the education law."
"They're just exempted because they're religious institutions and can set whatever rules of decorum they wish, no matter how discriminatory or racist," said Bloomfield, adding that he found the exemptions "very surprising."
The controversial Catholic school hair bans caught the attention of city and state officials last month after the Daily News exclusively reported that Queens mother Lavona Batts sued Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy in Jamaica, Queens, for telling her 9-year-old son to ditch his braids or leave, invoking city and state hair discrimination law.
Both Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio ripped the school's policy as "unacceptable" and promised action.
But city officials have been cautious so far, partly because of the Catholic schools' murky status under city law.
The city Commission on Human Rights, which enforces discrimination law, offered training and education materials to Immaculate Conception after Batts filed the lawsuit. But the school rebuffed the city's offer, and directed officials to the Brooklyn Diocese.
The city took a stricter line with Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger, an upscale Upper East Side salon, after multiple employees complained that management discouraged black employees from wearing natural hair because it didn't fit the salon's image.
Dorram, the salon's colorist, wrote in a text message that black employees who wore natural hair made the salon "look like we should be on E. 134th Street," according to The New York Times. In addition to the hefty fine, the salon was required to partner with a salon that specialized in black hair and complete community service.
The salon declined to discuss the case with The News.
Conversations with the diocese are going well, said city officials. Brooklyn Diocese spokesman John Quaglione said the diocesan superintendent "requested that all of our academies and schools closely examine their hair policy."
But officials at the New York Archdiocese, which oversees nine of the schools with natural hair bans still in their handbooks, is still backing its schools.
"Families attending any Catholic school agree to adhere to the terms of the school's handbook, which will include guidelines on hair, wardrobe and personal conduct," said T.J. McCormack, a spokesman for the New York Archdiocese, which supervises Catholic schools in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island.
Despite the hard-line stance, city officials said they have not received hair-related complaints from parents in the New York Archdiocese.
Even so, at least one legal critic said the handbook bans may not hold up in court.
Chaumtoli Huq, a professor at CUNY School of Law who specializes in labor discrimination, said judges in past court cases have ruled that the religious exemption from anti-discrimination law only applies under limited circumstances.
"This exemption was intended to protect a religious organization's free exercise of religion," said Huq. "I can't imagine any religious mission to prohibit a black child from wearing a hairstyle that is unique to being black."

Texto completo: Just over 1,000 miles from the coast of Australia lies New Caledonia, an island archipelago where the waters teem with life. This French territory, in the heart of the Coral Sea, is home to more than 9,300 marine species, including dugongs, manta rays and venomous sea snakes.
Among them is the greater sea snake, which can reach nearly 5 feet in length and is more than capable of killing a human with a single bite. But such a fearsome capability doesn’t bother Monique Zannier, 75, one of a group of seven women, ages 60-75, who snorkel regularly in Baie des Citrons, a bay in New Caledonia’s capital, Noumea.
“The Baie des Citrons is our playground,” she said. “We are in it almost daily, and we know all its nooks.”
What started as good regular exercise for Zannier has turned into a bounty of information for scientists studying the aquatic snakes. Researchers seeking new insights into the ecology of these reptiles have come to rely on the women, nicknamed the “fantastic grandmothers,” to help keep track of the hundreds of greater sea snakes that visit Noumea’s shallow-water bays.
An article published in October in the journal Ecosphere highlights the fruits of this collaboration between the team of snorkeling, senior citizen scientists and the study’s lead authors, Claire Goiran, a marine biologist at the University of New Caledonia, and Rick Shine, an evolutionary biologist at Australia’s Macquarie University.
“The grandmothers should be congratulated,” said Harold Heatwole, professor of zoology at the University of New England in Australia who was not involved in the study. “They’ve made a great contribution to science.”
Their diligent data collection, he said, has resulted in more detailed information on the ecology of greater sea snakes than is available for any other wide-ranging sea snake worldwide.
Unlike their terrestrial cousins, sea snakes are largely understudied. Most sea snakes live far offshore and are dangerous to handle, so few scientists have the means or desire to study them.
“We know very little about sea snakes,” Shine said. “Almost everything we know about them comes from ones that were accidentally caught in fishing nets.”
In 2013, Shine and Goiran set out to learn what they could about the mysterious greater sea snake. They chose the Baie des Citrons as the venue for this study, despite greater sea snakes having been seen there only six times in the past eight years. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings on their tails, so individuals can be easily identified from photographs.
With limited time to survey the bay and no full-time volunteers to assist them, Goiran and Shine got off to a slow start. During the first three years of the study, the pair managed to catalog only 45 greater sea snakes.
But that all changed in June 2017 when Goiran met Aline Guemas, a 61-year-old retiree. One morning, while Goiran was snorkeling, she saw Guemas photographing the reef with her camera.
“We started chatting in the water and I explained to her what I was doing and she told me she wanted to help,” Goiran said.
Guemas started joining Goiran on her weekly surveys, photographing sea snakes and recording their location on the reef.
“I was very happy,” Goiran said. “She did exactly what I needed her to do.”
She encouraged Guemas to recruit other retirees and, before long, she had assembled a team of seven.
“She told a friend and that friend asked another friend. It really came together by chance,” Goiran said.
Among the first to join the group was Zannier, who had taken up snorkeling as a form of physical therapy, as well as Sylvie Hebert, a 62-year-old retired nurse who has circumnavigated the globe by sailboat, and Marilyn Sarocchi, a 63-year-old gymnast with a fear of snakes.
“We meet every morning between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. We wear our diving equipment and we swim for one hour or two. Sometimes in summer, we can swim for three hours,” Sarocchi said. “Back on the beach we have tea and enjoy the beauty of the site. It is very relaxing.”
Since the group’s inception, the “fantastic grandmothers” have conducted hundreds of snorkel surveys in the Baie des Citrons and identified hundreds of greater sea snakes.
“As soon as the grandmothers set to work, we realized that we had massively underestimated the abundance of greater sea snakes in the bay,” Goiran wrote in the study.
The relationship between the grandmothers and the researchers seems to be mutually beneficial.
“We are very grateful to the scientists who let us have a part of their research,” said Genevieve Briancon, a 75-year-old retiree who joined the group shortly after its inception. “It’s very exciting. We learn a lot about sea life, and we are happy that our passion can be useful.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - As the impeachment inquiry moves into a critical week, President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are debating the degree to which the president should participate in a process they have spent more than two months attacking.
On Sunday evening, White House counsel Pat Cipollone told the House Judiciary Committee in a five-page letter that Mr. Trump would not participate in its first impeachment hearing, scheduled for Wednesday. The invitation from Chairman Jerrold Nadler "does not begin to provide the President with any semblance of a fair process," Mr. Cipollone wrote.
Four constitutional scholars - three chosen by Democrats, one by Republicans - are expected to testify on the standards for impeachment. Mr. Nadler, D-N.Y., told Mr. Trump he had until 6 p.m. Sunday to notify the committee that he or his attorneys would attend; he has given Mr. Trump until Friday to decide whether to participate more broadly in the impeachment process.
In his letter Sunday, Mr. Cipollone did not rule out participating in future hearings but asked Mr. Nadler to detail his plans for the upcoming proceedings, including whether he would allow further testimony and cross-examination of fact witnesses, among them those who already testified before the House Intelligence Committee. He also said Republicans should be able to call additional witnesses.
"Even at this late date, it is not yet clear whether you will afford the President at least these basic, fundamental rights or continue to deny them," Mr. Cipollone wrote.
Nadler spokesman Daniel Schwarz declined to comment on the letter.
The Trump administration's response suggests it will continue taking a defiant approach to the impeachment proceedings, betting that Republicans will stick together behind a noncooperation strategy meant to cast the inquiry as a partisan witch hunt. The move comes as Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee prepare to meet Tuesday to approve the release of their report detailing the panel's findings on Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
Mr. Trump has previously suggested that he might be willing to offer written testimony under certain conditions, though aides suggested they did not anticipate Democrats would ever agree to them.
"The Democrats are holding the most ridiculous Impeachment hearings in history. Read the Transcripts, NOTHING was done or said wrong!" he tweeted Saturday.
On Sunday, Democrats called on the White House to cooperate, suggesting an innocent person would have no problem testifying.
"We're certainly hoping that the president, his counsel, will take advantage of that opportunity if he has not done anything wrong," Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., said on ABC News' "This Week." "We're certainly anxious to hear his explanation of that."
But there is internal conflict over the extent to which Mr. Trump and his congressional defenders ought to engage, even as Republicans signaled that they will continue their aggressive campaign to delegitimize the process as corrupt and unfair.
Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Rep. Douglas Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he understood why the White House might want to skip the Wednesday hearing, calling it "just another rerun" covering ground already surveyed in previous Judiciary Committee hearings.
But he added that Republicans would be more keen to participate in future hearings - particularly one examining the findings of the House Intelligence Committee as prepared by its chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday to approve the report's release.
Other Republican lawmakers said Mr. Trump could benefit from availing himself of the due-process protections that Mr. Nadler has offered, including the right to present evidence, suggest witnesses and cross-examine those called by Democrats to testify.
The president did not address the issue himself Sunday. He sent two tweets about World AIDS Day in the early afternoon and spent a second day in a row at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., after returning early Friday from a Thanksgiving visit to U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
In the past, Mr. Trump has claimed he would like to participate. Last month, he said he would "love" for several senior administration officials to testify in the impeachment inquiry, but he contended that the White House was preventing them from doing so to protect the institution of the presidency.
On Sunday, Republicans renewed attacks on the impeachment process, a likely preview of what's to come this week.
Mr. Collins attacked the timeline that Democratic leaders are pursuing, one that appears aimed at concluding an impeachment vote in the House before Christmas, rather, he argued, than providing appropriate due process for the president.
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, meanwhile, said Sunday that Republicans were trying to distract from Mr. Trump's wrongdoing by raising objections to the impeachment process without challenging the facts that have been gathered.
Ms. Demings said Democrats were "not going to play any games" with Republicans and called on Mr. Trump to end his stonewall of the Democrats' witness and document demands.
"They want to ... play a political game and tie the process up in the courts as long as they can and run the clock out," she said. "We're not willing to play that game."

Texto completo: He and Mr. Belafonte were behind the calypso craze of the 1950s. Mr. Burgie was also a singer, under the name Lord Burgess.
Irving Burgie, a singer, composer and lyricist whose songs were immortalized by Harry Belafonte during the calypso craze of the 1950s, died on Friday in Brooklyn. He was 95.
His death was confirmed by his son Andrew.
Known professionally as Lord Burgess, Mr. Burgie (pronounced BURR-gee) was at his height in 1956 when he wrote eight of the 11 tracks on Mr. Belafonte's celebrated album "Calypso," among them "Jamaica Farewell," "I Do Adore Her" and "Dolly Dawn."
The album, said to be the first by a single artist to sell more than a million copies, was No. 1 on the Billboard chart for 31 weeks and helped propel Mr. Belafonte to stardom and make calypso music known internationally. One of the biggest hits from the album was "Day-O" ("The Banana Boat Song"), based on a Jamaican folk song. Mr. Burgie and William Attaway wrote the lyrics for the version sung by Mr. Belafonte, which he originally performed on television on "The Colgate Comedy Hour" in 1955. It became Mr. Belafonte's signature song.
Calypso "revolutionized music" by introducing Afro-Caribbean rhythms to the pop mainstream, Mr. Burgie told the journal American Music in 2016.
"The combination of me as the writer and Belafonte as the performer took off," he said.
He went on to work on two more albums with Mr. Belafonte, "Belafonte Sings of the Caribbean" (1957) and "Jump Up Calypso" (1961).
Mr. Burgie also wrote "Island in the Sun," another Belafonte hit, for the 1957 movie of the same title starring Mr. Belafonte, Joan Fontaine, James Mason and Dorothy Dandridge.
Mr. Burgie had begun to establish a music career before his association with Mr. Belafonte, performing at clubs like the Blue Angel in Chicago in 1953 and the Village Vanguard in New York in 1954. In the calypso tradition of adopting a flamboyant stage name, he became -- at the suggestion of Max Gordon, the Vanguard's owner -- Lord Burgess.
"If there were an aristocracy in the world of calypso," the critic Robert Shelton wrote in The New York Times in 1968, reviewing a concert by Lord Burgess at Carnegie Hall, where he performed with a six-piece band and a dancing chorus, "Lord Burgess would be one of the reigning figures."
He added: "The audience had a very good time, it appeared. They understood or had previously encountered and mastered Lord Burgess's lyrics, which are central to the style. Despite the barrier of dialect, slang and speed, he seemed a jolly and artful man who moved with his music and moved others with it."
Irving Louis Burgie was born not in the Caribbean, as most calypso entertainers of his era were, but in Brooklyn, on July 28, 1924. He was a second-generation West Indian American; his mother, Viola Calendar, was from Barbados, and his father, Louis Burgie, was from Virginia. He grew up hearing Caribbean music in his home.
He graduated from Automotive High School in Brooklyn in 1941. Drafted into the Army in 1943, he served in an all-black battalion in China, Burma and India.
It was in the Army that Mr. Burgie took a serious interest in music. "There was a guy in this outfit, Jimmy Houston, who was an alto sax player in the states," he told American Music. "I studied with him and learned about chords and intervals."
He began to sing in an Army chapel choir, encouraged by fellow soldiers who told him he had a good voice.
After he left the Army, the G.I. Bill opened unexpected opportunities for him. With its help, he began taking classes at night at Brooklyn College and learned about the music program at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. He auditioned there and was accepted, majoring in voice and planning to be a singer of classical music. He continued his musical education at the University of Arizona and at the University of Southern California.
After college, Mr. Burgie worked as a camp counselor and sang at camps in upstate New York, and it was at Camp Minisink, run by the Harlem-based New York City Mission Society, that he met Mr. Belafonte in the summer of 1950. With a common background -- both had been born in New York City (Mr. Belafonte in Harlem) and both had parents from the Caribbean -- they struck up a friendship.
"They asked Harry and me to do a number at the monthly birthday party in the dining hall the next night," Mr. Burgie said in an interview in 2017 for this obituary. "We met and rehearsed the next afternoon, and that evening we did a duet on 'John Henry' that really broke up the place."
As the folk music revival got underway in the 1950s, Mr. Burgie was inspired to write songs based on the traditional Caribbean songs he had heard in his childhood and on the songs he had discovered in his extensive research into the genre.
He also began performing at nightclubs, though he continued to write songs, including "The Seine," "El Matador," and "Wish You Were Here." The Kingston Trio, Miriam Makeba and many others recorded his tunes. In 1966, when Barbados won independence, he was invited to write the lyrics for the national anthem.
Mr. Burgie's songs have had a long life. "Jamaica Farewell," Mr. Belafonte's theme song, has been recorded by Jimmy Buffett, Carly Simon and others. The echoing "Day-O" from the song of the same name has become a rallying cry at Yankee Stadium and other sports arenas, and the song was memorably heard in the 1988 Tim Burton movie "Beetlejuice."
Mr. Burgie's educational ventures included two books, "The West Indian Song Book" (1972) and "Caribbean Carnival: Songs of the West Indies" (1993).
Mr. Burgie's talent also landed him Off Broadway in 1963. He wrote the music and lyrics (and, with Loften Mitchell, the book) for "Ballad for Bimshire," a musical set in Barbados. It explores racism, nationalism and colonialism while telling the story of a teenage girl and her dream to come to the United States. The show, starring Ossie Davis, ran for 74 performances at the Mayfair Theater in Midtown Manhattan.
"Mr. Burgie's songs almost cover the gamut -- they are sweet, nostalgic, torch, comic and ebullient," Howard Taubman wrote in his review in The Times, "His lyrics vary in quality from indifferent to joyously apt, but he rarely is shy of an engaging melody, and he can unleash rhythms that provide almost as much thrust to the production numbers as a booster rocket on a launching pad."
Mr. Burgie had been active as a performer of Caribbean folk music before the Belafonte surge, but he sidelined that career as his songs for Mr. Belafonte grew ever more popular.
But Lord Burgess did occasionally re-emerge, as he did in 1984 at Folk City in Greenwich Village. Reviewing the show in The Times, John S. Wilson wrote admiringly: "Mr. Belafonte may have gotten more than the songs from Lord Burgess. He may have gotten the manner of singing them."
That same year, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of Britain released "Island in the Sun," an album of Mr. Burgie's songs. Mr. Burgie released his first solo album, "Island in the Sun: The Best of Irving Burgie," in 1996, and another, "The Father of Modern Calypso," in 2003.
"Day-O!!!: The Autobiography of Irving Burgie" was published in 2007, the same year that Mr. Burgie was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.
Mr. Burgie married Page Turner in 1956; she died in 2003. His second wife, Vivia Heron, died in 2007. Besides his son Andrew, his survivors include another son, Irving Jr. ; one grandchild, and one great-grandchild.
A recipient of several honorary doctorates, Mr. Burgie was also given a permanent honor by the borough where he was born. His name is inscribed on the Celebrity Path at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, joining other Brooklyn luminaries like George Gershwin, Woody Guthrie and Jackie Robinson.
Photograph Irving Burgie wrote lyrics for Harry Belafonte's "Day-O" ("The Banana Boat Song"). "The Father of Modern Calypso" was Mr. Burgie's second solo record. He published his autobiography in 2007. (PHOTOGRAPH BY STAR BLACK)

Texto completo: Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wants banks and credit card companies to flag purchases that could signal a person is preparing to carry out a mass shooting, a solution she said could circumvent the usual partisan debate on gun violence.
She introduced a bill this month that would direct an agency of the Treasury Department to figure out how to track buying patterns the same way the government looks for behavior indicative of money laundering, fentanyl trafficking and human smuggling.
Supporters of the legislation say it builds on existing infrastructure and harnesses law enforcement expertise to try to prevent gun violence without preemptively removing guns or further regulating sales " both non-starters among Second Amendment advocates.
But skeptics say that even if credit card companies, banks and retailers agree to work together to disclose detailed information about sales, the federal government would need a system for analyzing huge amounts of data and deciding when and how to respond.
An effective program would have to track credit card purchases of guns and ammunition as well as equipment such as body armor and night-vision goggles across multiple retailers.
'Banks, credit card companies and retailers have unique insight into the behavior and purchasing patterns that can help identify and prevent mass shootings,' said Wexton, whose plan has the backing of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun-control organization. 'The red flags are there " someone just needs to be paying attention.'
Wexton, a freshman lawmaker and former prosecutor from Loudoun County, made gun violence a centerpiece of her 2018 campaign. Four Republicans are running for the nomination to challenge her next year.
Gun policy was the top issue for Virginia voters a month before the Nov.-5 state election that gave Democrats control of the House of Delegates and Senate for the first time in a generation, according to a Washington Post-Schar School poll.
Democrats have made gun control a priority since former governor Terry McAuliffe's 2013 campaign, but the issue took on urgency after the May-31 shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building where a gunman killed 12.
In the poll, 3 out of 4 voters rated gun policy as a 'very important' issue, and overwhelming majorities supported background checks and'red flag' laws allowing authorities to take weapons away from people deemed dangerous. A majority also backed statewide bans on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips, as well as limiting gun purchases to one per month.
The Democratic-controlled U.S. House passed legislation to expand background checks, but the bill is stalled in the GOP-controlled Senate.
Gridlock on gun legislation led Wexton, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee, to seek creative ways to prevent gun violence.
She introduced a bill in June that would allow law enforcement officers to block people who they determine are a danger to themselves or others from buying gun silencers and machine guns.
The Virginia Beach shooter's use of a silencer, which can make the sound of gunfire difficult to recognize, brought national attention to the devices.
The silencer bill and the bill to track gun purchases have no Republican co-sponsors.
Wexton's latest bill, the Gun Violence Prevention Through Financial Intelligence Act, would give the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury Department, a year to identify barriers to collecting purchase data.
The bill directs FinCEN to consult with the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and firearms sellers.
One challenge could be obtaining details about items purchased, and the effectiveness of the program would hinge on the willingness of retailers to share information about specific firearms and accessories.
Many of those responsible for the deadliest shootings of the past decade financed their attacks using credit cards, a 2018 New York Times investigation found.
Credit cards were used to pay for guns and military gear used in the 2012 attack on a Colorado movie theater and thousands of rounds of ammunition before the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida, according to the report.
In a May interview with Bloomberg News, the chief executive of Mastercard said his company does not have the information to track potentially suspicious purchases.
FinCEN already tracks behavior indicative of human smuggling, such as multiple wire transfers below $3,000 from across the United States and transfers from countries with high migrant populations such as Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
Human trafficking red flags include frequent payments to online escort services for advertising and payroll costs that don't match the stated business purpose.
Joseph Moreno, a former federal prosecutor and FBI consultant who is a partner at the financial services law firm Cadwalader, said moderates may be open to Wexton's legislation.
'It seems like moderate middle ground that privacy and Second Amendment advocates should be able to meet in the middle on,' he said. 'We're not talking about banning any kind of purchases or a federal registry.'
However, he noted that tracking could also discourage bad actors from using credit cards altogether. Cash purchases would make the transactions impossible to follow.
'It's the kind of thing that needs to be explored if we're going to be serious about addressing lone-wolf terrorism,' he said. 'But the devil's in the details.'

Pelosi says Trump ‘hasn’t built any new wall’

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently claimed President Donald Trump isn’t serious about building his promised Southern border wall and that his comments on the topic “are really an applause line at a rally.”
“The President hasn’t built any new wall in the whole term of office,” Pelosi added, speaking on “Face the Nation” this week.
Trump’s intentions are difficult to judge, but we can examine his progress, or lack thereof, on the border project.
So we had to ask: Is Pelosi right that no “new wall” has been built?
Our research
We started by reviewing last week’s White House briefing by acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan. Asked by a reporter about the project, Morgan confirmed that all 78 miles of what he described as “new” border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers. The work includes building steel bollard fencing, which consists of vertical steel posts with a small amount of space between them.
It is not, however, the solid concrete wall that Trump promised during his campaign and said Mexico would pay for.
“The Trump Administration has not completed any new miles of border wall. Replacement wall is not new wall,” Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill told us in an email.
Hammill added that the House Appropriations Committee hasn’t funded any new border wall, at least not of the type Trump had promised.
That is supported by The Washington Post’s September analysis of the project’s funding. “Trump asked Congress in 2018 for $25 billion to cover the cost, but Congress refused. Lawmakers appropriated $1.57 billion, restricted to “fencing,” such as “currently deployed steel bollard designs,” the Post reported.
As we reported back in January, “Congress has not appropriated money for a wall. Fencing is being built or has been completed at the southwest border. But not a wall.”
First truly new section
Pelosi’s statement ignores one key new stretch: Construction started in late October on the first new section where no structures stood previously, just south of Donna, Texas, according to a recent New York Times article.
This eight-mile stretch will take months to complete. So far, it includes two twin see-through panels of 18-foot-tall steel beams, according to the Times.
A matter of semantics
Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said much of the debate over Trump’s progress and whether he’s built any “new wall” comes down to semantics.
“It depends on your definition of ‘new,’ Cardinal Brown wrote in an email. “If ‘new’ is defined as newly-built, even if it is replacing other barriers in the same location, then you can accurately say new wall has been built. If ‘new’ is defined as built in new locations along the border where previous barriers did not exist, then it would be correct to say that there hasn’t been any new wall built. It is that semantic difference that the government and Democrats are exploiting in their rhetoric.”
Our rating
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently claimed President Trump “hasn’t built any new wall” during his time in office.
That’s supported, in part, by the Trump administration’s Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner. He confirmed at a press briefing last week that all 78 miles of what he described as “new” border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers.
These replacement barriers, however, aren’t the solid, concrete wall candidate Trump talked about. They are see-through bollard fencing.
Pelosi’s statement does leave out one piece of key information. Construction is now underway on the first original stretch of border barriers during Trump’s presidency, an eight-mile section of fencing in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.
Pelosi’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
We rate it Mostly True.

Chesapeake Bay group joins suit against EPA

Texto completo: The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has joined a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to challenge a Trump administration proposal that would pose air quality concerns for the Chesapeake Bay.
A coalition of environmental advocacy organizations filed suit Nov. 22 in Federal Circuit Court to block the EPA from withdrawing California's permission to set its own automobile emissions standards, which are stricter than federal rules.
The proposal to revoke the waiver, which was announced by the Trump Administration in September, matters because a number of Chesapeake Bay Watershed states also follow portions of the California standards, said John Surrick, a Chesapeake Bay Foundation spokesman.
Unlike under the federal Clean Water Act, which allows individual states to set their own rules as long as they are stricter than federal standards, the Clean Air Act does not allow states to supersede federal rules without a waiver, said Ariel Solaski, a staff attorney at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
The agency has granted the state of California a waiver to adopt standards for light-duty vehicles for more than half a century, according to the EPA website.
EPA did not respond to an email requesting comment.
In total, 14 states have adopted parts of California's program, including Delaware, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania, as well as the District of Columbia.
"Something that's really important to note is that these programs have been very effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including nitrogen oxides, and increasing the amount of zero-emission vehicles in the fleet," Solaski said.
"Part of the reason California was able to adopt the standard is ... they have to show compelling and extraordinary circumstances to show why they have a different program than the federal standards. EPA has found many times that those criteria is met."
Roughly one-third of the nitrogen pollution in the bay comes from the air, and about half of that is in the form of nitrogen oxides, said Beth McGee, senior water quality scientist at CBF. Nitrogen oxides are a group of seven gases that can create environmental health hazards when they react in the presence of sunlight or chemicals to form smog or acid rain.
Nitrogen oxides are released from vehicle exhaust. It's important to have high standards for vehicles in the bay region because tailpipe pollution behaves different from other polluting sources that shoot the gases up into the atmosphere, McGee said.
Tailpipe pollution from local vehicles is especially damaging to local waterways because it stays low to the ground, not travelling far, McGee said. Tailpipe pollution from vehicles in the watershed area can go directly into the bay and its tributaries.
Maryland adopted a Clean Cars Program modeled after the program in California in 2007. The program was estimated to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions collectively by about three more tons per day than the federal standard, according to the Maryland Department of the Environment.
The program achieves these reductions by requiring that cars pass strict tailpipe emissions tests. It also includes what is known as the "ZEV mandate" — a requirement that vehicle manufacturers put up for sale an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles (which include electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and plug-in electric hybrids) in the state each year.
Maryland has a goal of putting 60,000 zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2020 and 300,000 ZEVs on the road by 2025, according to MDE. Collectively, the nine states (including Maryland) involved in a cross-country ZEV task force are aiming to put at least 3.3 million ZEVs on the roadways by 2025, according to the task force website.
Efforts by Maryland and other bay states to use mechanisms like the Clean Cars Program to improve their local air quality have impact on those states' abilities to adhere to the federal and state bay cleanup programs currently in place.
Air quality is a component of the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, which sets pollution reduction milestones and consequences for failure upon the bay watershed states. Without a Clean Cars Program, Maryland would need to find another way to clean up the air to Blueprint standards by the deadline of 2025.
Because nitrogen oxides are also emitted by coal-fired power plants and the burning of natural gas, the source of the electricity powering zero-emission vehicles matters.
Therefore, CBF said they are also opposed to other rollbacks the Trump administration has made on regulations concerning air pollution.
"Conceptually, we don't really want to see any rollbacks in anything addressing greenhouse gases," McGee said.
In September, The New York Times reported that during President Trump's tenure, his administration has committed to rolling back 24 rules related to air pollution and emissions, as well as 18 rules concerning drilling and extraction. In total, the Trump administration has scheduled rollbacks for 85 environmental rules.
The rules are targeted for removal because they seen as burdensome to the fossil fuel industry and other big businesses, the Times reported.
CBF joins a coalition of NGOs in this litigation, including the Center for Biological Diversity, Communities for a Better Environment, Environment America, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Texto completo: These are the words fans of Hen of the Wood have been waiting to hear for more than three months: The popular Burlington restaurant reopened Nov. 22, after closing for repairs due to an Aug. 6 fire.
Owner Eric Warnstedt confirmed the opening date in a Nov. 19 Facebook message to the Burlington Free Press. He said the Cherry Street restaurant would open for oyster hour at 4 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, and resume its normal service and hours.
Diners won't notice any changes in the restaurant, according to Warnstedt. The August fire damaged duct work shared by Hen of the Wood and the adjacent Hotel Vermont, leading to evacuation of both businesses. Hotel Vermont remained open while Hen of the Wood shut down so the repairs could be made. There were no injuries in the blaze.
Hen of the Wood also has a site in Waterbury that opened in 2005 and helped put Vermont cuisine on the national map. Mark Bittman of The New York Times raved about that restaurant in a 2008 article in which he wrote, "it's difficult to think of a restaurant here in the city that can generate such feelings of satisfaction, fulfillment, culinary pleasure and near-joy as Hen of the Wood."
Warnstedt opened Hen of the Wood's Burlington restaurant in 2013. A note on the restaurant's website mentions that there was "zero damage" to the restaurant and no staff members lost pay as a result of the fire and the restaurant's temporary closure.

Texto completo: A gunman fired into a crowd on a block with stores, a day care center and students heading to after-school classes.
Five people, including two boys, ages 10 and 14, were shot in the Bronx on Wednesday by a man firing into a crowd, the police said. The hail of bullets caused chaos on a block with stores, a day care center and students headed to after-school classes the day before Thanksgiving.
None of the injuries sustained by those who were hit in the shooting, on Courtlandt Avenue near East 151st Street in the Melrose neighborhood, were life threatening, the police said. The other victims were two women, ages 35 and 19, and a 20-year-old man, the police said.
Four of the five were taken to Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, fire officials said. The 10-year-old went separately to Harlem Hospital Center in Manhattan, the police said.
No arrests had been made by Thursday afternoon, according to the police, who described the gunman as a man in his 20s wearing a black jacket who ran east toward Melrose Avenue.
"We're praying for the swift recovery of the five people -- including two children -- struck by gunfire in the Bronx tonight," Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter.
Adam Lin, the manager of Courtlandt Wine & Liquor, on Courtlandt Avenue near 151st Street, said he had heard gunfire in the area before, but he thought the noise he heard just before 4 p.m. on Wednesday was from a construction project nearby.
"I wasn't sure until I saw the crowd in the street and people ran into my store," Mr. Lin said, standing in the store's doorway shortly after 7:30 p.m. Behind him, a worker wearing disposable blue gloves mopped blood off the floor.
Mr. Lin said that about a half-dozen people rushed into the store after he heard the gunfire and that a woman in the group told him three of them, including "a little boy," had been hit. They were screaming and "seemed scared," Mr. Lin said. Someone in the group called out, "He's my brother," he added.
Mr. Lin said the police had arrived as he was calling 911.
William Polson, who works at a deli up the block, said he saw three people, including a boy, taken out of the liquor store on stretchers. Mr. Polson said that an ambulance took a fourth person, a man who had been lying on the curb, away.
"He was bleeding badly," Mr. Polson said.
Michael Kamber, who runs the Bronx Documentary Center at the corner of Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, said that staff members were about to teach after-school classes to middle- and high-school students when they heard the gunfire.
Mr. Kamber, a photojournalist who once worked for The New York Times on contract, was out of town at the time of the shooting. But he said he was unfortunately not surprised to hear what had happened.
"There has been a big ramp up in violence and drug activity in the last six months," he said, adding that crime in the neighborhood was "as bad as I've seen it" in the eight years since he opened the center.
Mr. Kamber also expressed frustration over what he called police officials' failure to do more to combat the problem as he and other community leaders have asked.
The neighborhood is in the 40th Precinct, a section of the South Bronx that is two and a half square miles and that includes the Mott Haven neighborhoods. The precinct has traditionally had among New York City's highest rates of serious crime, which the police largely attribute to rival gangs fighting for control of the area's dense concentration of public housing complexes.
So far this year, the precinct has experienced fewer serious crimes overall than it did in the comparable period last year, with shootings specifically down, according to the most recent police data.
From 2014 to 2017, the precinct bucked a citywide trend of declining crime. And even as crime in the area dropped over the past two years, the 40th Precinct still ranks No. 4 among the city's 77 precincts for the total number of serious crimes.
Mr. Kamber said there was "not a lot of comfort" to be found in the Police Department's statistics. That the injuries caused by the shooting were not life threatening did not provide him with much solace, either.
"That's just luck," he said. "Every bullet has its own trajectory. We might not be so lucky next time."

Why Mark Ruffalo wades right in

Texto completo: Shortly after moving to Callicoon, N.Y., in the late aughts, Mark Ruffalo received an invitation to make the brief journey to Dimock, Pa., to meet with folks whose lives had been upended by drilling for natural gas. Nearly two dozen people brought with them binders of health records, letters they had written to environmental agencies and photos of their tap water on fire in hopes that Ruffalo, who had made no secret of his ire over the Iraq War, would extend his outspokenness to shedding light on their troubles.
Overwhelmed, he ran right out.
But that night, Ruffalo recalls on a late November evening, he lay awake in bed, his mind racing: 'Who are you, Mark Ruffalo? Are you really who you say you are? Are you someone who cares about your neighbors? If someone in need who has less than you reaches out to you, are you willing to use this platform to do something righteous and good?'
It's akin to a superhero origin story, the way he tells it " if that character were a three-time Oscar nominee who over the past decade has become one of the most prominent activists among the Hollywood crowd. Between his stints as an actual superhero (the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Hulk), Ruffalo, 52, has also starred in films he hopes contribute to 'a greater conversation.' The latest is Todd Haynes's legal thriller 'Dark Waters,' concerning the pervasiveness of 'forever chemicals,' or toxic polyfluorinated chemicals (a.k.a. PFAS) that are non-degradable and accumulate in living creatures over time.
Seated in a room off the Ritz-Carlton lobby, Ruffalo has just returned from a day spent on Capitol Hill with lawyer Rob Bilott, the real-life inspiration behind the 'Dark Waters' protagonist. In the film, which is based on a 2016 New York Times Magazine article, Rob pivots from defending chemical corporations to taking on the behemoth DuPont after discovering runoff from a nearby DuPont site has been poisoning a farmer's cows. Rob realizes there are human lives at stake, too, when he uncovers decades' worth of concealed documents linking the synthetic chemical used to make Teflon nonstick coating (as well as other household items) to serious health issues such as cancer.
On the Hill, Ruffalo and Bilott met with Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the minority leader, to demand stronger action against the military's use of forever chemicals, which have been found in water supplies across the country. They also testified in a hearing alongside activists.
'I sort of believe that when the time is right, the culture calls a film like this forward,' Ruffalo says. 'Sometimes those movies land and they'll have impact, like 'Spotlight' or even 'The Kids Are All Right.' I don't know what's going to happen with this. I hope that we can have that greater conversation about it, but it's pretty remarkable that this movie is coming out the very week they're finally talking about doing something to regulate PFAS.
'I mean, that ? That's cosmic, you know?'

Before the blockbusters, the auteur thrillers or even the romantic comedies, Ruffalo acted primarily onstage; he trained with Stella Adler, who came out of the Group Theatre. Those guys were 'agitators,' he says, contributing to a tradition that taught him it was important to engage politically as an actor, as an activist, as a human being in the world.
So when someone as beloved as Ellen DeGeneres preaches unconditional kindness as a defense of her controversial friendship with former president George W. Bush, as she did last month, Ruffalo isn't compelled to stick with the celebrity flock that praises her. He says what he feels, in this case tweeting that until 'Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War . . . we can't even begin to talk about kindness.'
'Listen, I think it's important that we don't forget things,' he says of the tweet. 'A lot of division we see in the United States right now, it's a justice issue. And if we can't hold the powerful accountable, then there's no justice in our country. And if there's no justice, then there's no way for us to agree upon anything. . . . So I do feel compelled to speak up.
'We tortured so many people. We disrupted the balance of the Middle East, right? We demonized a whole group of people based on their religion, you know? Like, really ugly things happened. I would say even more ugly things happened during that administration than what we're seeing now, that affected people in the most negative ways.
'I was outraged that we would have maybe forgotten that.'
There isn't much standing in the way of Ruffalo continuing to speak his mind. He doubts any major companies are going to 'pay me to be their spokesman or drive their cars' because 'I might be too radical for that, which is fine.' What he doesn't say explicitly is that he's also an A-lister of a more privileged demographic who has maintained his ability to draw in audiences. Those Oscar nominations arrived well after he became 'anti-fracking's first famous face,' as New York magazine once described him.
As for Marvel executives, Ruffalo says they don't seem to care if he ruffles feathers every once in a while as much as they hope he will never again accidentally live-stream a film at its world premiere. (The incident occurred two years ago with 'Thor: Ragnarok.')
Clear of those suits, Ruffalo is challenged by another sort. During the PFAS hearing, skeptical lawmakers questioned his authority to speak on the subject at hand.
'They took some issue with me being an actor, and how dare I?' Ruffalo says, nodding with exasperation when asked whether he often receives that treatment.
'But my response is, I make these stories. I'm a storyteller, and these are real stories and real people, people that we may never hear from unless someone did tell a story about them. I'm also an American, and I have every right to be there.
'I don't work for them, they work for us, you know?'


Before approaching him outside the Taft law offices in Cincinnati, Ruffalo followed Bilott around, closely studying his gait. The two had met before, when the actor swung by the Bilott household after reaching out about the 2016 article. With this subsequent visit, he hoped to soak up as much about the lawyer's overall demeanor as he could.
It can be challenging for films like 'Dark Waters' to keep the audience engaged, given that the most dramatic elements often involve characters sifting through papers. Animated protagonists can make up for that; recall Ruffalo's outburst as Boston Globe reporter Mike Rezendes in 'Spotlight,' a film about the visually dreary trade of print journalism.
Bilott, on the other hand, posed 'an interesting acting problem to work out.'
'To be true to Rob, he's not demonstrative,' Ruffalo continues. 'He approaches the law with this kind of equanimity of emotions and dispassionate sort of rigor. That's not what we're used to in our heroes, you know?'
The trick to centering a film on a more subdued character, per Ruffalo, is to invest enough interest in his interiority, his motivations for fighting an uphill battle. Asked what convinced him that Ruffalo could play him on-screen, Bilott doesn't mention Ruffalo's acting prowess but rather his understanding of the gravity of what had transpired. Bilott has been working for nearly 20 years to get the federal government to pass regulations restricting the emissions of forever chemicals " and still, no dice.
'Mark called, expressing interest in believing that this was a story that needed to be brought out to a wider audience,' Bilott recalls over the phone. 'He came out and met with me and the boys, he spent time with us. It was clear he understood the story.'
Despite some past missteps, Ruffalo has remained committed to the fight for clean water, which he describes as 'the thing that connects us.' He joined the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in protesting the Dakota Access pipeline, for example, and hopes that the more he uses his platform in such a manner, the more others in Hollywood are encouraged to as well.
'I have seen people really drop their fear in my community, for the right reasons, and really start to speak up in profound ways that they would never have done 10 years ago,' he says. 'I'm not saying that I led that, but I hope that people saw, well, Ruffalo isn't getting crucified for this stuff, so maybe [if I speak out about] the things that I actually care about in the world, it'll be okay.'

Texto completo: Q: Could you tell me the name of a science-fiction series from the late '90s or early 2000s that had humans visiting other worlds, like on "Stargate: SG-1"? A number of episodes had Colm Meaney (of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine") as a farmer who turned out to be head of the planet's military, and they were battling aliens known as the Wraith.
A: It's interesting that you mention "SG-1" since the show you are asking about is the related "Stargate: Atlantis." Episodes originally aired from 2004 to 2009; its five seasons are on DVD and streaming on Hulu.

Q: I've read an article that said "Days of our Lives" producers have canceled all their actors' contracts and this may mean the end of this soap opera in 2020. Is there any truth to this? The show also fast-forwarded their whole story one year ahead. What's going on?
A: At this writing, "Days," which has been on the air since 1965, is not canceled. But, as TVLine said in breaking the news about the actors' contracts, "Days" distributor Sony and NBC are negotiating a new deal, and there's no guarantee the network will keep the show going. In the meantime, Corday Productions, which makes the show, has announced a production hiatus and released the actors from their contracts.
Daytime soaps have been endangered for a long time, with only four currently on networks: "Days," ABC's "General Hospital" and CBS' "The Young and the Restless" and "The Bold and the Beautiful." The time jump on "Days" looks like an attempt to liven things up creatively, and ratings-wise. The contracts being dropped is a way to save money if the show is renewed. One insider told TVLine that the actors can now be asked to take a lower salary if offered new contracts.
But none of this means "Days" is going end right away. According to TVLine, the show shoots telecasts eight months in advance and has banked enough episodes right now to keep going through summer 2020.

Q: Will "MacGyver" be coming back? I really liked that program.
A: The reboot of the classic Richard Dean Anderson series will be back in CBS' Friday lineup on Feb. 7, leading off the network's night. "Hawaii Five-0," which had been in the first slot, will move an hour later. "Magnum P.I." will take a break but return in the spring, the network says. And "Blue Bloods" will still complete prime time on CBS on Fridays.

Q: We are PBS viewers and the last several episodes of "800 Words" have been repeats. Is the series complete? I have an idea that the show wrapped up. If so, why the reruns?
A: The series, about an Australian newspaper columnist moving his family to a town in New Zealand, ended production in 2018 after three seasons and 40 episodes total. In the U.S., it is not on PBS per se but is sold to individual public TV stations by the distributor American Public Television. Like many shows, including those from overseas, it has faithful viewers who are still drawn to repeats.

Q: You recently answered a question about "Lawman," one of my favorite Westerns. Please tell me about Peter Brown, who costarred on the show with John Russell.
A: Brown, who played young deputy Johnny McKay on the 1958-62 series, had a long career that included another Western, "Laramie," several runs on daytime dramas and movies such as "Foxy Brown," "Kitten With a Whip" and "Ride the Wild Surf."
According to the New York Times, the actor born Pierre Lind de Lappe made his last screen appearance in 2005 but continued to appear at fan shows and festivals until his death in 2016 from Parkinson's disease. He was 80.

Could Philippine troll armies hit US?

Texto completo: As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity -- or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online -- they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data -- and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

Texto completo: American Thanksgiving is typically seen as a celebration of the cooperation between the English who settled the continent and the natives who helped them grow crops and saved them from starvation. It is a story about how multicultural cooperation and private-property incentives, both strong American principles, can boost a harvest.
But as Thanksgiving 2019 approaches, I am struck by another lesson: America's need to come to terms with a history that, as it relates to the treatment of Native Americans, has remarkably few heroes on the side of the white settlers.
For contrast, consider the recent disputes over The New York Times 1619 project, which argues that anti-black racism has been in the DNA of the U.S. since the arrival of the first enslaved people in 1619. There has been a lot of pushback to this argument, most recently from the Civil War historian James McPherson. The U.S. also has a redemptive side, he says, as represented by the opponents of slavery. William Lloyd Garrison, Abraham Lincoln and the millions of whites who supported the civil rights movement in the 1960s may make you feel slightly better about the American experiment.
But when it comes to Native American history, there is no American president who fills a role remotely comparable to that of Abraham Lincoln or even Lyndon Johnson for African Americans. Nor, until the 1960s, is there much history of entertainers, athletes or academics speaking up effectively for Native American rights.
Presidents Grover Cleveland and Franklin Delano Roosevelt did set up and then improve the reservation system. Even if you favor those decisions, the result nonetheless reeks of segregation, of parsimoniousness, of a continued history of poverty and deprivation. The system is at best an unsatisfactory compromise rather than a source of national pride.
Who since then are the white heroes - those who later deregulated casino gambling and mining rights for many reservations? Again, even if those decisions were for the better, it is hard to find much to boast about.
Nor is there any major American political ideology that can sit comfortably with the historical treatment of Native Americans, which has been multipartisan in its awfulness. Many libertarians fail to decry the government coercion involved, since they also wish to invoke the growth of the American republic as a major event in the history of freedom. Even if most libertarians are embarrassed by how much of America's glory is rooted in land theft and massacres, they do not emphasize land reparations as a solution.
Nor does classical Marxism or communism offer a convenient base for condemnation of this aspect of U.S. history, as those ideologies emphasize the necessity of uprooting earlier modes of production so that economies can progress to capitalism and then socialism.
Even the most optimistic narrative - the convergence of multicultural cooperation and market incentives - is incomplete. Multicultural cooperation breaks down if one side becomes so powerful that it can later simply take from the other side, and that is indeed what happened. So one lesson is that political cooperation usually rests on a delicate balance, with no assurance it will continue over time. (If you would like a case study in how such an order can unravel, I recommend Pekka Hämäläinen's "Lakota America," which is my favorite nonfiction book of this year.)
A related lesson of Thanksgiving is that good news can end in bad news, with no real reversal in sight. That, too, is an appropriate reminder for an America that, at least up through the 1990s, was all too willing to congratulate itself as a world historical force for good.
One final Thanksgiving lesson for 2019: A place you love - for me, the United States - can also be a country that in some crucial ways has had very few good guys, at least once you take all of the issues into account. That counsels skepticism about today's heroes, because it suggests that a near-universal moral failing just might be in our national DNA.
This lack of heroes should also make Americans more reluctant to judge their political opponents so harshly. All of us are part of a system built on longstanding historical crimes, and thus we have more in common with those opponents than we might like to think.
Thanksgiving always has universal lessons. This year they just feel more depressing - and more urgent - than usual.

Texto completo: Saying it could not verify the writer's identity, the website Patreon deleted posts in which someone claiming to be a longtime girlfriend of the singer said he had abused her.
Saying it could not verify the writer's identity, a website on Tuesday deleted posts in which a person claiming to be a longtime girlfriend of the singer R. Kelly accused him of years of emotional and physical abuse.
The account holder on the website Patreon claiming to be Joycelyn Savage posted lurid allegations against Mr. Kelly over the weekend, claims that were reminiscent of accusations that have been made against him by other women, in news reports and in the Lifetime documentary series, "Surviving R. Kelly."
Multiple news outlets, including The New York Times, reported on the posts this past weekend. But on Tuesday, after several online commenters raised questions about the authenticity of the posts, Patreon took them down.
"After multiple unsuccessful attempts to verify the identity of the account holder," Patreon said in a statement, "we closed the Patreon page allegedly associated with Joycelyn Savage due to potential impersonation."
Patreon pays writers based on how many paid monthly subscriptions they attract. The person claiming to be Ms. Savage had drawn about 1,800 followers, each of whom paid at least $ 3 to view the three posts published on Saturday and Sunday. Patreon said all the subscription payments would be refunded and the creator of the posts would not receive any money. It sent an email to subscribers on Tuesday saying the account had been suspended because of "suspected fraud."
The person claiming to be Ms. Savage did not respond to several messages from The Times seeking clarification on her identity. Nor did anyone claiming to be Ms. Savage publicly accuse the author of having impersonated her.
Mr. Kelly, 52, is in jail facing numerous state and federal charges including child pornography, sexual assault and obstruction of justice. He is also accused of bribing the family of a teenage girl so she would not testify against him in a child pornography trial, in which he was acquitted of all charges in 2008. His lawyer, Steve Greenberg, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
The Patreon posts were striking not simply because of the abuse they described, but because the real Ms. Savage has been a staunch backer of Mr. Kelly, showing up to support him in court and defending him on national television. An Instagram page, also under Ms. Savage's name, linked to the posts. Before the additions this past weekend, the Instagram page contained only two selfies of Ms. Savage, both from July 2017.
Instagram said on Tuesday that after reviewing the account, it found evidence that it had been hacked "some time ago." It has restricted access to the rightful owner if she logs in again.
In the Patreon posts, the writer claiming to be Ms. Savage accused Mr. Kelly of controlling when she ate, bathed and used the bathroom; of choking her once when she didn't address him as "Daddy" or "Master"; and impregnating her and forcing her to get an abortion.
Gerald Griggs, a lawyer representing Ms. Savage's family, said they also tried to make contact with her through Patreon and the Instagram account, but were unsuccessful. The family has said Ms. Savage was being held by Mr. Kelly in a kind of emotional and sexual captivity, and that he had cut them off from contact with her.
Mr. Griggs said Ms. Savage's parents still believe she is not in control of her life, even though Mr. Kelly has been in jail for months.
"With the potential dangers facing Joycelyn and her safety we are asking law enforcement to get involved in determining where Joycelyn is and who was behind the account that details potential crimes," he said.
Ms. Savage, who lived with Mr. Kelly for several years, went on "CBS This Morning" in March along with Azriel Clary, another live-in girlfriend, saying they were staying with the singer voluntarily. Both have showed up at several court appearances in support of Mr. Kelly.

‘The Daily Show’ host Trevor Noah will bring his Loud &amp; Clear Tour to Staples Center

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Bloomberg campaign rebuts claims it's using cheap candidate ad rates to damage Trump

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's late entry into the 2020 Democratic field spurred charges his candidacy was actually a veiled attempt to access to lower advertising rates for commercials aimed at harming President Trump's reelection chances, rather than a serious bid to win the presidency.
The Bloomberg campaign says that's not so.
Federal Communications Commission regulations require that broadcasters give candidates for federal office the lowest available ad rate for a period before an election, but those rules do not apply to groups like PACs and super PACs. As a result, outside groups end up spending more for airtime, meaning political contributions don't go as far.
“He’s going to get more bang for his buck with the campaign ads he’s putting up,” Fox News contributor Lisa Booth said of Bloomberg on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Tuesday. “So what he gets to do is throw a Hail Mary campaign, ‘Maybe I’ll win, I probably won’t, but who cares?’ And what he also gets to do is put all this money in to damage President Trump in the process.”
A Business Insider analysis published Friday said that his campaign "could be part of a strategy to pay the cheapest rates possible to air anti-Trump ads."
Bloomberg campaign spokesman Marc LaVorgna said Wednesday that's not the case.
“The theory is ridiculous," LaVorgna told the Washington Examiner. "He is running because he is the best candidate to ensure Donald Trump is not reelected, to start to rebuild from the damage Trump has caused, and to deliver results for the country.”
Bloomberg, New York mayor for 12 years starting in 2002, is worth an estimated $54.6 billion. Bloomberg, 77, is self-funding his campaign with no outside political donations. He has dished out more than $30 million on a weeklong nationwide ad blitz, a show of strength and way to play catch-up as a late entry in a crowded primary with candidates who have been campaigning for most of the past year.
[Related: A tale of two billionaires: Trump and Bloomberg disrupt primaries four years apart]
Rather than a takedown of Trump, however, the ads introduce the former New York mayor as a candidate and overwhelmingly focus on Bloomberg’s biography and accomplishments.
Trump is not mentioned by name in the ads, but he appears on-screen briefly as a narrator condemns “the denial of this administration to protect the only home we have from the growing menace of climate change.” The White House is pictured alongside a reference to “a different kind of menace coming from Washington.”
Bloomberg earlier this month pledged to spend $100 million of his own money on a digital ad campaign against Trump. Digital ads are a category not affected by the FCC regulation, meaning that Bloomberg’s candidacy gives him no better bang for his buck.
The $100 million in anti-Trump ads is in addition to what Bloomberg will spend on showcasing himself as the best candidate to win the Democratic presidential nomination, according to the New York Times. The ads, which have messages such as, “A tweet shouldn’t threaten our country’s security” and “Trump doesn’t care,” direct to Bloomberg’s campaign website.
And the FCC regulation that guarantees the lowest available rates for federal candidates only applies during “political protection” periods: 45 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election. Bloomberg’s first broadcast ads are running 68 days ahead of the first-in-the-nation Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, well outside the period where the regulation makes a measurable difference.
Bloomberg is expected to skip campaigning in the first four early nominating contest states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina — and instead focus on winning votes in March 3, “Super Tuesday” states and beyond.
Rival candidates have condemned Bloomberg’s massive self-funded campaign.
“If you get out and knock on 1,000 doors, he'll just spend another $37 million to flood the airwaves. And that's how he plans to buy a nomination in the Democratic Party,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said during a campaign stop in Iowa on Monday.
Bloomberg responded to the attacks by pointing to his previous political and charitable spending. When he was mayor, he founded Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which later became Everytown for Gun Safety, and has donated billions to charitable causes.
"For years, I’ve been using my resources for the things that matter to me," Bloomberg told reporters Monday. "I’m fully committed to defeating Donald Trump. I think he’s an existential threat to our country. I’m going to make my case and let the voters, who are plenty smart, make their choice."

Texto completo: This week, Americans will endure flight delays, traffic jams and other logistical miseries to spend time with family and friends. And when the holiday weekend is ending, many will lament that they don't get to spend enough time with those relatives and friends.
But during the weekend itself, these same lamenters will spend a lot of time ignoring the people around them and distractedly staring into their phones. They will get a notification and disappear down a digital rabbit hole of Facebook posts, text messages and fantasy-football updates. They will monitor the comments on the photos they just posted, instead of engaging with the human beings in those photos.
Many of us have a complicated relationship with our phones. We enjoy them in the moment. Yet when we reflect on all the time we spend looking at a tiny screen, we feel lousy about it. We pine for a less addictive relationship with the online world.
So let me make a suggestion for this Thanksgiving weekend: Turn off your phone, and keep it off for a full 24 hours. I predict you'll be surprised by how much you'll like it.
About a month ago, my wife and I decided that our family would spend a Saturday without the internet, a practice known as a Tech Shabbat (a reference to the Jewish day of rest). I wasn't sure whether I'd like it, I'll admit, and our kids were even less sure.
But it was wonderful. We hung out with friends, without distraction. We never had to ask, guiltily, "Sorry, what'd you say?" because we had been only semi-listening. In between scheduled activities, we took a walk and played a board game, Settlers of Catan. I spent time thinking about long-term projects instead of replying to unimportant emails. It felt productive, rejuvenating and, yes, fun.
Tiffany Shlain, a filmmaker who popularized the idea of a Tech Shabbat, says that on her day without screens, she laughs more, sleeps better and feels healthier. As she writes in her recent book, "24/6": "Having one day off each week shocks you anew into the realization of how bizarre it is that everyone is head-down, looking at screens all the time. That should never feel normal."
My family liked it so much that we did it again a week ago. This coming Saturday, we will put away the phones for a third time, while we are with my extended family.
You should try it, too. In between the material gluttony of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, enjoy a Phone-Free Saturday or Sunday (or, for that matter, Thanksgiving Day).
To have a successful Tech Shabbat, you should choose ground rules that work for you. We turn off our cellphones, tablets and laptops and stick them in a cabinet. We're willing to watch sports on television, if more than one person is doing so. We rely on our landline to reach other people.
You may prefer stricter or looser rules. But I recommend against half measures, like keeping your cellphone in your pocket and claiming you'll look at it only if it rings. Out of sight, out of mind.
There are certainly parts of Tech Shabbat that I find uncomfortable. Making a last-minute plan is tricky, and looking up the answer to an intriguing question is nearly impossible. That's part of the point, though - to slow down and stop obsessing about the immediate. Many people come up with their freshest ideas when they're not occupied.
You can also minimize the downsides with a little advance planning. Print out your family's schedule, as well as anything you need for a looming work project. (I wrote part of this column with a pen.) Print out directions. If you're smarter than I am, you'll remember to print directions both to and from where you're going. Following them in reverse doesn't always work.
Part of an advance plan is telling friends and colleagues that you're unplugging for 24 hours. They will probably respect you for it. Margaret Diddams, the provost of Wheaton College in Illinois, doesn't check her email on Sundays. Her colleagues know to reach her on her phone if an urgent problem comes up. Most problems, of course, are not urgent.
I recognize this approach will be harder for teenagers, who have grown up with texting. But they may need a break more than anyone.
Perhaps most important, make sure that your Tech Shabbat includes a big dose of joy. Shlain's family starts its 24 tech-free hours by eating a rollicking Friday dinner with friends. If you're taking your first Tech Shabbat and need to win over a skeptic in the family, you could go out to a favorite restaurant for a meal.
The beauty of turning off your phone this holiday weekend is that there are so many joyful alternatives. Take a hike or play touch football with relatives or friends. Go with them to a museum or local bookstore. Cook an ambitious recipe.
And take a few minutes to give thanks, which is a whole lot easier when you aren't staring into a screen.

Texto completo: 'Dark Waters' ***1/2
If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.
Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure -- more than 20 in this case -- that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, West Virginia, who was acquainted with Bilott's grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg.
Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried. Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by DuPont deposits its chemical waste.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply.
Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.

These Manhattan synagogues want to become condominiums

Texto completo: One of the most active times of day at the West Side Jewish Center begins precisely at 1:40 p.m., when 60 or so middle-aged men trudge in, mutter through the afternoon prayer service with their coats on, maybe throw a couple dollars of charity into a metal cup and walk back to their jobs. The whole thing is over in about 15 minutes.
Other than that and two shifts of morning prayers, the building is mostly empty during the day. On a recent weekday afternoon, two men studied Jewish texts in Yiddish in a wide room at the front of the building. Long curtains obscured boards bearing the names of generations of congregants who have died. Hot water boiled in a machine that looked like straight out of a 1980s diner.
The overall impression of mustiness belies what is, in fact, an active congregation with good prospects. Not many synagogues can boast more than 100 people praying on a daily basis. The congregation, established by immigrants in 1890, recently renamed itself the Hudson Yards Synagogue to better attract residents of the posh new development of the same name that just sprung up nearby.
But as the 94-year-old synagogue stands on the cusp of a new era, its building is both its greatest asset and liability. On the one hand, the structure is dilapidated and inaccessible to people with disabilities - a significant problem when a good portion of your regulars are senior citizens. On the other hand, it's valued at $55 million thanks to its location on one of the busiest streets in the busiest city in America.
That's why the congregation is looking into demolishing the whole thing and rebuilding it as a condominium - with a synagogue on the lower floors.
"This building needs major work," Rabbi Jason Herman said. "We're putting a lot of Band-Aids on it. In addition to funding the building, we want to fund programming and operations, so we can become the shul that's attractive to the neighborhood in the Hudson Yards."
The SynaCondo concept, as architect Esther Sperber calls it, could be a win-win for developers and the synagogue. Developers get to build in some of the most desirable parts of the city, while synagogues get much-needed cash and state-of-the-art spaces.
Sperber's renderings envision a wood-paneled basement sanctuary lit by a skylight and an outdoor garden for the synagogue's exclusive use one floor above. Additional space that could be used for social events is available beneath the sanctuary, two floors below ground level.
"This was an opportunity to think about a problem that seems really relatable to other properties in the city," Sperber said. "If you give up that dream of being above grade and use that space that's less valuable to the developer, you can actually get more space and find a way to make that space unique and special and beautiful."
The West Side Jewish Center would not be the first synagogue in New York City to attempt such a transformation, but it could be the first to succeed. Though on paper it seems like a great idea, in practice deals like this can turn into nightmares.
Both The Young Israel of Manhattan on the Lower East Side and the Fort Tryon Jewish Center in Washington Heights - both historically Jewish Manhattan neighborhoods now in the throes of gentrification - sought to go the condo route. But developers who began working on the buildings were unable to complete them, leaving the projects in limbo and the synagogues renting space elsewhere. (Full disclosure: I am a member of the Fort Tryon Jewish Center.)
"Unfortunately, in 2008, everything fell apart, so our contractor also sort of fell apart," Rabbi Yeshaya Siff of the Young Israel said. "Since then, the question is, what to do now because the people [at the synagogue] are older and the whole area is becoming upgraded, gentrified. The question is, how realistic is building all of this now?"
Other synagogues in the city have also faced hurdles in rebuilding. Lincoln Square Synagogue, a prominent Modern Orthodox congregation on the Upper West Side, sold its property and began construction on a new facility nearby. But the synagogue nearly ran out of cash and had to be bailed out by an anonymous $20 million donation in 2010. It opened its new doors three years later.
Kehilath Jeshurun, a tony Upper East Side synagogue whose building was charred by a fire in 2011, received $9 million from insurance. But the rebuilt interior, which reopened in 2015, cost nearly $40 million to complete, according to The New York Times.
Sperber says synagogue real estate deals like these are especially fraught because they combine Manhattan's complex market with the unique demands of an Orthodox community that generally cannot change locations and whose chain of command is at times confusing.
"When you look at shuls compared to other nonprofit institutions, the decision-making process at a shul is a little bit less clear," she said. "The chair of the board may be a very important person or may not. There's an executive director - they may be the decision maker but they may not. The rabbi may be the decision maker but may not."
Other synagogues appear to be executing the condo transition more successfully.
Habonim, a congregation on the Upper West Side, had a nursery school that was outgrowing its existing space. Constructing a new building would have cost too much, so instead the synagogue inked a deal with a condo developer. In the meantime, the synagogue has been operating out of rented space.
Richard Verner, Habonim's board president, estimates it will take another three to four years for the synagogue to move into its new building - a longer timeline than it expected when it began planning the sale several ago.
"It's a long process and any change is difficult for a community, so it would have been great if we could have closed the doors on the old building and a year later moved into a lovely new building, but that's not the way things work in New York," Verner said. "We're trying to keep everyone excited about the end result."
Shaare Zedek, another Upper West Side synagogue, also has been in a temporary space since 2017 as its SynaCondo is being built. The synagogue is partnering with Kehillat Hadar, an egalitarian prayer group in the neighborhood.
Michael Firestone, the synagogue president, said the choice to demolish the old building was difficult but obvious, and he remains optimistic that everything will work out.
"We're the third-oldest shul in Manhattan. We started in the Financial District, went to the Lower East Side, then Harlem," Firestone said. "There was a lot of emotion tied up in it, but the vote to do the deal was unanimous. The community recognized that this was a moment in history that had to be met boldly."

Candidates Go on Offensive for Abortion Rights

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential candidates don't want to simply defend abortion rights. They want to go on offense.
The Democratic presidential field has coalesced around an abortion rights agenda more far-reaching than anything past nominees have proposed, according to a New York Times survey of the campaigns. The positions reflect a hugely consequential shift on one of the country's most politically divisive issues.
Every candidate The Times surveyed supports codifying Roe v. Wade in federal law, allowing Medicaid coverage of abortion by repealing the Hyde Amendment, and removing funding restrictions for organizations that provide abortion referrals. Almost all of them say they would nominate only judges who support abortion rights, an explicit pledge Democrats have long avoided.
Very few support restrictions on abortions late in pregnancy. Seven say abortion pills should be available over the counter. Nine want a federal approval process for state abortion laws. And Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose ambivalence on abortion rights has been a theme for decades, is seeking to recast himself as a full-throated champion of them.
The 2020 candidates' responses reflect a fundamental change in the Democratic Party's approach to reproductive issues. In other areas, from health care to taxes, there is a divide between liberal and moderate candidates. Here, it is minimal.
"What you've seen is that it's no longer O.K. for any candidate just to say they're pro-choice," said Jacqueline Ayers, vice president for government relations and public policy at Planned Parenthood. "They're being very specific on how our rights are under attack, how access to abortion is being undermined in this country, and putting forth plans to protect and expand rights."
With several states passing near-total bans on abortion, and with the first Supreme Court majority in a generation that could overturn Roe v. Wade, the Democratic candidates are at once agreeing that abortion rights require a more forceful defense, and concluding that defense is not enough.
The ramifications are hard to predict. The public is strongly supportive of Roe v. Wade, but deeply divided on how accessible abortion should be beyond Roe's basic protections. President Trump has shown that he is willing to weaponize abortion to turn out his base, including through misleading or outright false narratives. And historically, abortion has been a bigger motivator for conservative voters than liberals.
Whether any of this changes in 2020 will depend, in part, on how the Democratic nominee talks about abortion rights, particularly in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where many swing voters are not as far to the left on abortion as the candidates.
"You can't rule out that it could become an issue," said Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll in Pennsylvania, "depending on the candidate and to what degree they move it forward as an issue."
A basic reframing
The most striking change, beyond individual policies, is how unapologetic candidates' tone on abortion rights has become.
Advocates have traditionally said they support the right to choose abortion, not abortion itself, and Democrats have said it should be "safe, legal and rare." Public debate has commonly centered on procedures after 20 weeks' gestation, which account for less than 1.5 percent of abortions. The discussion has often been on opponents' terms.
Now, almost every candidate says the next president should actively reframe the debate. Their language focuses on health care, bodily autonomy and, at times, even the idea of abortion as a positive force enabling women to control their lives and increase their economic security.
"Abortion is health care, and health care is a human right," Elizabeth Warren wrote in her survey response. In the last debate, she argued that abortion rights were "also economic rights."
Only Tulsi Gabbard, Joe Sestak and Marianne Williamson now say abortion should be "safe, legal and rare" -- a phrase, popularized by President Bill Clinton and repeated by Hillary Clinton, that reflected a search for common ground with people not fully supportive of abortion rights.
The rest of the 2020 candidates sidestepped or rejected the "rare" part. Bernie Sanders, for instance, wrote, "Abortion should be safe, legal and accessible to every person who chooses it."
Asked if they supported restrictions after 24 weeks -- roughly when a healthy fetus can survive outside the womb, though viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy -- only Mr. Sestak said yes. (Ms. Gabbard, who did not complete the survey, has also said she supports restrictions in the third trimester.) Several candidates emphasized that less than 1 percent of abortions happen that late, often because of life-threatening conditions or severe fetal abnormalities.
Amy Klobuchar's campaign did not fully answer the question, saying she believed "any restrictions must be consistent with Roe v. Wade."
Roe allowed near-total bans in the third trimester as long as there was an exception for life- or health-threatening situations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey replaced the trimester framework with one based on viability, which can start in the late second trimester.
An emboldened defense
For years, the battle over the Supreme Court has been conducted in code. Republicans denounced "judicial activism" and Democrats called for justices who would "respect precedent" -- that they were talking about one precedent in particular remaining unsaid.
Not anymore.
In May, Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to nominate only judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. Though she is no longer in the race, her pledge is: All of the candidates who completed the survey said they would "require judicial nominees to support Roe v. Wade as settled law."
Mr. Biden's campaign brought up his role in blocking Robert Bork's confirmation to the Supreme Court in 1987, which probably would have meant the end of Roe. Mr. Biden's objections then were more about birth control than abortion -- but his eagerness now to play up the latter is telling of how profoundly the Democratic terrain has shifted.
Also telling is that the candidates are not solely talking about preserving Roe: In an acknowledgment that the Supreme Court might have enough votes to dismantle it, they all support legislation to codify its protections.
Every candidate who responded wanted to ban states' so-called TRAP laws (an acronym for targeted regulations of abortion providers). These measures -- requirements that providers have hospital admitting privileges, for instance, or that hallways be a certain width -- don't technically restrict abortions but have the effect of making it harder for clinics to remain open.
And a majority endorsed a federal preclearance requirement for state abortion laws, which Ms. Harris proposed in May. Only Andrew Yang and Joe Sestak definitively rejected it.
Preclearance, which would block the laws in question until the Justice Department approved them, could stop TRAP laws as well as waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds. It would also pre-empt bans like Alabama's and laws like Georgia's (both blocked by courts for now) that forbid abortion after six or eight weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.
A shift to offense
The idea of expanding abortion rights, not just maintaining them, was in the wings of the debate until recently. Now, it is center stage.
Like every Democratic president in the past 35 years, the candidates (except Ms. Gabbard) have all pledged to repeal the Mexico City policy, or global gag rule, which blocks foreign aid to organizations that provide abortion referrals or promote abortion rights. All of them want to undo President Trump's Title X rules, which similarly restrict family planning funding for organizations within the United States.
But they have also gone further. All of them want to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which blocks Medicaid coverage for abortion in most circumstances. Twelve want to repeal the Helms Amendment, which has prevented foreign aid from being used to cover abortions since 1973. (Mr. Biden's campaign did not answer that question.)
Nine candidates want to require private insurers to cover abortion, though Mr. Biden's campaign again declined to answer, Ms. Klobuchar said she was unsure and Mr. Sestak said no.
And seven said the drugs misoprostol and mifepristone, which induce abortions, should be available over the counter.
This would be a major leap from current policy, which restricts the drugs' availability even by prescription, and would require multiple legal and regulatory changes. But if enacted, it would make it much harder to effectively ban abortion.
Betting on public opinion
A common thread in the candidates' answers was a firm belief that the public is on their side.
Whether that is true is a complicated question, likely to play out next year as many elections since 2016 have -- in the growing chasm between rural and suburban voters.
"A lot of his white, working-class voters are not in favor of abortion," Mr. Madonna said of the president, but "suburban voters tend to be more liberal on a whole array of cultural issues."
On the basic tenet that Roe v. Wade should stay, Democrats are on solid ground: Polls show that anywhere from 60 percent to more than 75 percent of Americans support Roe.
But there is much less support -- 20 to 30 percent, generally -- for making abortion always legal, as the candidates advocate. That's more popular than making it always illegal, but most Americans are in between.
Even among Democrats, according to Gallup, "legal under any circumstances" is a minority position, ranging from 39 to 46 percent in the past couple of years. Among independents, that number is about 25 percent.
So it is noteworthy that, in a historically large field, there is little differentiation among the candidates on abortion rights -- even among the more moderate candidates who, on other issues, have emphasized courting swing voters.
"They're setting the tone that this is something we should own proudly," said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, "and not just react to when something happens."
HOW WE COLLECTED THE DATA
The New York Times sent a survey to 16 Democratic candidates on Nov. 5. Eleven completed it. For those who did not -- Steve Bullock, Julián Castro, John Delaney, Tulsi Gabbard and Kamala Harris -- we examined publicly available information from policy papers, debates and interviews.
The survey was conducted before Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick entered the race.

Texto completo: The president's lawyer met with the head of the department's criminal division about a money laundering case involving Alejandro Betancourt López.
WASHINGTON -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, represented a wealthy Venezuelan businessman in a discussion with the Justice Department about heading off charges against the businessman in a money laundering and bribery case.
Mr. Giuliani was part of a team of lawyers brought in to represent the Venezuelan, Alejandro Betancourt López, in discussions with Justice Department officials, according to people familiar with the representation.
They said Mr. Giuliani and at least one other lawyer traveled to Spain to meet with Mr. Betancourt in August, prepared a presentation making the case for why Mr. Betancourt should not be charged, then delivered it to top lawyers in the Justice Department's criminal division during a meeting in Washington on Sept. 3.
The representation, which was first reported by The Washington Post on Tuesday, is another example of Mr. Giuliani pursuing business around the world with clients who have interests before the United States government, even as he continues to represent Mr. Trump. It also highlights the ways in which Mr. Giuliani mixed his private business with the Ukrainian pressure campaign that is at the heart of the congressional impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, and a separate investigation by prosecutors in Manhattan into whether Mr. Giuliani violated lobbying laws.
During Mr. Giuliani's trip to Spain, he stayed at Mr. Betancourt's estate outside Madrid along with two Soviet-born associates who assisted Mr. Giuliani in his effort to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations sought by Mr. Trump.
Mr. Giuliani and the associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, traveled to Madrid for a day during the trip to meet with a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.
In the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times, Mr. Giuliani urged Mr. Zelensky's aide to pursue the investigations sought by Mr. Trump into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and whether Ukrainians sought to damage Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. Mr. Giuliani also discussed the prospect of Mr. Zelensky securing a White House meeting with Mr. Trump.
It does not appear as if the Ukraine work was related to Mr. Giuliani's representation of Mr. Betancourt.
Mr. Betancourt did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Mr. Giuliani's lawyer, Robert J. Costello, said in a statement that "it would be improper for Mr. Giuliani to comment on whether anyone is or is not a legal client of Mr. Giuliani."
"Therefore," he continued, "Mr. Giuliani will not comment one way or the other."
Mr. Betancourt has not been charged with any crime, but The Miami Herald reported this month that he was among the unnamed Venezuelans identified as conspirators in a criminal complaint filed in Miami detailing an embezzlement and bribery scheme that siphoned $ 1.2 billion from the country's government-owned oil company.
Jon Sale, Mr. Betancourt's Miami-based lawyer, said his client denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Sale declined to comment further on the case, or on Mr. Giuliani's involvement in it.
Mr. Sale and another lawyer who has represented Mr. Betancourt, Frank H. Wohl, worked with Mr. Giuliani as federal prosecutors in Manhattan in the 1970s.
Mr. Wohl, Mr. Sale and Mr. Giuliani were among the lawyers who represented Mr. Betancourt in the Sept. 3 meeting in Washington with lawyers from the Justice Department, including Brian A. Benczkowski, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's Criminal Division.
After that meeting, which was first reported by The Times, a Justice Department spokesman issued a statement saying that Mr. Benczkowski and the other department lawyers would not have met with Mr. Giuliani had they known that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were under investigation by prosecutors in Manhattan.
Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were arrested last month on campaign finance charges, in a case that is linked to the investigation of Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani has complained that the scrutiny of him has hurt his business.
"The damage that it does to your practice is pretty damn bad," he said in an interview this month, "because people don't want to be your client. They think they're going to get investigated for every stupid little thing that somebody can find to ask a question about. People come to me because they like confidentiality."

Texto completo: Through advertising, social media and guerilla marketing, Nike promotes itself as more than just an athletic shoe and apparel company.
It also envisions itself a lifestyle brand and champion of social causes — especially female empowerment.
Earlier this year, Mark Parker, the company’s chairman, CEO and president said, “We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for women in sport, with more participation, more coverage, and overall, more energy.”
Too bad it seems that nobody in power at the Nike Oregon Project — the company’s professional track and distance running team of athletes who lived and trained together — got the message.
Last month, the 18-year-old program was disbanded after head coach and founder Alberto Salazar — the legendary American marathoner and three-time winner of the New York City Marathon — received a four-year coaching ban from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency because he allegedly “trafficked testosterone, infused a prohibited amount of L-carnitine and tried to tamper with doping controls.”
That Salazar — who denies the charges and is appealing the ban — would be caught up in a doping scandal is hardly surprising.
Rumors about him being on the wrong side of the
rules have been swirling since the BBC and Pro Publica reported on it in 2015.
But the headlines for Salazar and Nike have only gotten worse.
Earlier this month, former Nike Oregon Project runner Mary Cain, now 23, detailed in a New York Times video op-ed how, after signing with Nike in 2013 at age 17, the former high school phenom was subjected to years of untold cruelty — highlighted by public humiliation and body-shaming over her weight.
“I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto and endorsed by Nike,” said Cain, who left the Nike Oregon Project in 2016.
So constant was the verbal and psychological abuse — especially when she didn’t hit her target times — that Cain said she developed an eating disorder, started cutting herself, stopped menstruating and lost so much bone density that she suffered five separate fractures and became suicidal.
Cain’s disclosures rocked the athletic world.
They prompted Nike to launch a self-investigation — and led to other elite female former Nike athletes to share just how toxic the atmosphere was at Nike Oregon Project.
Especially when it came to female runners’ bodies and weight.
“After placing 6th in the 10,000m at the 2011 USATF championships, I was kicked out of the Oregon Project. I was told I was too fat and ‘had the biggest butt on the starting line,’” tweeted 2008 Olympian Amy Yoder Begley.
Kara Goucher, a 2012 Olympic marathoner who helped provide doping evidence against Salazar, tweeted that “the culture was unbearable.”
Goucher’s husband, fellow distance runner Adam Goucher, who also trained under Salazar, was much more specific.
He tweeted that after Kara finished in sixth place at the 2011 Boston Marathon in a personal record of two hours, 24 minutes — just six months after giving birth to the couple’s first child — Salazar and sports psychologist Darren Treasure told Kara’s mother and sister that Kara “... is still too heavy. She needs to lose her baby weight if she wants to be fast again.”
In a powerful New York Times op-ed last week, former professional runner Lauren Fleshman denounced “the very common practice for coaches to directly create an eating-disorder culture in the name of performance by focusing on weight and appearance.”
Female athletes in individual sports such as swimming, gymnastics and figure skating are also extremely vulnerable to the eating-disorder and body-dysmorphia culture that prioritizes aesthetics over sustainable fitness and health.
Fleshman believes that this approach is especially harmful to female high school and college runners because “the natural improvement curve of young women generally includes a performance dip or plateau as the body adjusts to the changes of adolescence.”
In other words, female biochemistry dictates different performance-improvement expectations than the ones used for male runners, who are expected to improve in a more predictable, linear fashion.
Fleshman became a five-time NCAA champion and 15-time All-American at Stanford by not trying to conform to the “thinner is better” model.
But during her senior year, she succumbed to the prevailing wisdom, “restrict[ing] my diet to make my 21-year-old body, still soft from the new estrogen infusing it, look like the leaner 28-year-old women I saw making Olympic teams. I wasn’t ready for that kind of body. I made myself into it anyway. I may have looked the part, but I lost my energy. I lost my period, and injuries set in, derailing the first half of my professional running career.”
Overhauling how all coaches — but especially male coaches — approach the training of female athletes won’t be easy or simple.
There are decades worth of systemic paternalism and outdated protocols to undo.
But undoing them — or, even better, creating a brand-new system — is vital if we’re to ensure that more elite female athletes have the best chance to reach their full potential.
As Fleshman wrote, “If sports were built for young women and girls, the focus on weight would be replaced with basic nutrition and education, which would dramatically reduce injuries and mental health disorders for all genders.”

Supreme Court temporarily blocks disclosure of Trump’s financial records

Texto completo: Washington • The Supreme Court on Monday temporarily blocked an appeals court ruling that required President Donald Trump’s accounting firm to turn over financial records to a House committee.
The court’s brief order gave no reasons, and there were no noted dissents.
The court’s stay was in one sense routine, maintaining the status quo while the court decides whether to hear Trump’s appeal in the case. But it also suggested, given that it takes five votes to grant a stay, that the court viewed the legal questions presented by the case as substantial enough to warrant further consideration.
The court set a speedy briefing schedule, requiring Trump to file his petition seeking review by Dec. 5. The court could announce whether it will hear the case in the coming weeks and, if it does, issue a decision by June.
A Supreme Court ruling in the case could yield a major decision on the balance of power between Congress and the executive branch and on the role of the court in enforcing the separation of powers.
The justices are likely to consider the case alongside a similar one concerning a subpoena from Manhattan prosecutors to Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, seeking eight years of business and personal tax returns. That case is further along at the Supreme Court, as Trump has already filed a petition seeking review and the prosecutors have filed a brief urging the court to deny review.
In both cases, Trump sued to stop Mazars from complying with subpoenas for his financial records. Federal appeals courts ruled against Trump in both cases.
Monday’s stay order concerned a subpoena that the House Oversight and Reform Committee issued in April after it learned that Trump’s ethics disclosure forms did not list a debt for hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election. Trump and his company reimbursed the president’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Trump. The president has denied the relationship.
Cohen also told the committee that Trump had inflated and deflated descriptions of his assets on financial statements to obtain loans and reduce his taxes.
Trump’s lawyers argued that the subpoena was improper because the committee lacked a legitimate legislative purpose for seeking the information. A divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected that argument.
In the Supreme Court, lawyers for the committee argued that its investigation was driven by its legislative and oversight responsibilities. They added that the “rapidly advancing impeachment inquiry also makes it particularly important that Congress not be deprived of the information sought by the subpoena.”
On Nov. 18, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. entered a temporary “administrative stay” in the case. The new stay order was issued by the full court.
The case from New York concerns a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, for eight years of Trump’s personal and business tax returns in connection with the hush-money payments.
A unanimous three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, ruled this month against Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president’s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.
The New York case involves more ambitious legal arguments. Trump’s lawyers, in a petition seeking review of the 2nd Circuit’s decision, said he was immune from criminal investigation while he remained in office.

At Holiday Meals, Hold the Politics

Texto completo: Dreading the political debate at your Thanksgiving meal? At least you're not a political reporter!
One of the professional hazards of being a national political reporter is most certainly Thanksgiving.
You think political discussions at your holiday dinner are intense? Try coming over to one of our houses!
But professional political observers or not, we are all now living in the era of divisive dinner, a moment when our politics have grown so polarized that they can ruin even the best prepared stuffing.
There's some data on this: A majority of adults say they "dread the thought of having to talk about politics at Thanksgiving dinner," according to a poll conducted in 2017 by PBS "NewsHour," NPR and Marist.
So, I figured, who better to ask for advice on navigating those heated discussions than my colleagues, who deal with divisive politics for a living?
My question kicked off quite the debate on The New York Times politics desk.
There are the Avoiders.
Thanksgiving is supposed to be a day away from work, and some of us have strategies to keep it that way.
"My secret: Rotisserate the bird. You can spend most of the day outside fussing with the grill and out of earshot," said national correspondent Trip Gabriel, who will spend his holiday in balmy Westchester County, N.Y.
Nick Corasaniti, our New Jersey correspondent turned political reporter and Tuesday newsletter host, wants to distract his family with a Jersey turkey. "Instead of putting bacon on the bird as it roasts, cover it in Taylor ham," he said. "This will be enough of a conversation starter that we will only talk about how brilliant this idea is." (Sorry, Cory Booker, we don't have many vegans on staff.)
Sydney Ember, who has moved to Iowa to cover the caucuses, will be spending the holiday in Massachusetts. She has a simple request: "Don't ask me about Iowa."
There are the Regionalists.
All politics is local, right?
"Yes, Bill de Blasio ran for president," Matt Flegenheimer, our super-New Yorker political reporter, plans to tell his family. "I promise, I was there. I think."
National political correspondent Jonathan Martin's answer? "Football and oysters" are far more "fulfilling distractions" at his New Orleans holiday table.
Jennifer Medina, our Los Angeles-based political reporter, is going to tell her relatives just how important they are. "If politics is mentioned at all, it will be something like 'Do votes in California really matter?"' she said. "To which I will then stand on my soapbox and talk about how much the West will matter this cycle, both in the primary (Nevada is third! California will start voting as Iowans caucus!) and in the general (Arizona! Texas?! And Nevada, again!)."
And there are the Embracers.
Our political reporter Jeremy Peters, who will be spending the holidays in St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, plans to offer this piece of wisdom: "Stop asking me who's going to win. Do you think we learned nothing last time?"
"Vote for who you like, not for who you think a mythical stranger you invented might like," senior politics editor Johanna Barr plans to counsel in Saugerties, N.Y.
"I'm sure the words Joe Biden will be said within five minutes," said national political reporter Astead W. Herndon, who will be in Flossmoor, Ill. "I truly don't get what people talk about for that much time without talking about politics."
Then there are the real pros.
To resolve all these conflicting views, I went to a true political professional: Senator Amy Klobuchar, whom I happened to see over the weekend in New Hampshire. She plans on spending the holiday in Iowa with her husband and daughter.
Unsurprisingly, she's fully supportive of political debate at the Thanksgiving table. (And of yam casserole, her favorite holiday dish -- though she was careful to note that it's not a Minnesota "hot dish.")
"I'm saying go for it, and maybe mention that there is a senator from Minnesota," she said.
Drop us a line!
We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .

Obama on 2020: Your responses
Last week, we asked for readers' reactions to former President Barack Obama's comments about the 2020 race. Mr. Obama stirred the pot, after all, when he cautioned the Democratic presidential candidates not to move too far to the left on policy, saying that "the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it."
And wow, did you have thoughts! Nearly 800 of you wrote to share your views of Mr. Obama's remarks, and the reaction was, shall we say, fiercely divided.
Here's what some of you had to say:
"He misunderstands how many people, including those of us who like him, still see his signature achievements as half delivered. ... We didn't just want hope. We wanted him to fight for us. And now, living in Trump's America, we want someone who will fight for us." -- Diana Wynne, San Francisco
"I am a Democrat who thinks that President Obama's remarks were spot on. I am terrified that Democrats will lose the next election if we have a left-wing candidate in 2020. I think some Democrats and most independents will not be willing to vote for someone on the left wing of the Democratic Party. They just might decide to not vote at all." -- Julia Gibson, The Woodlands, Texas
"I think he was wrong. People know much of what politicians say when running for office is aspirational. We know they can't waive a magic wand and make it so. We also know that on several fronts, including the environment especially, we are running out of time. This is a time for bold policy ideas, not incrementalism." -- Mark Burnham, Cranston, R.I.
"I'm here in rural Wisconsin. I think he's right that people aren't ready for such dramatic change. It does not seem timely to expect voters to swerve so dramatically left now, when they need to be coaxed back into trusting a Democratic Party that will show up for an average American who is neither far left or far right." -- Sharon LaCour, Amery, Wis.
"Obama's not reading the country. Maybe too busy hobnobbing with the rich and famous to see that America is losing its innocence. People want change, real change. Not the porridge they were fed during his administration." -- Wanda Gumm, Los Angeles
"Clearly he is giving his best advice -- and I agree 100 percent. ... Our extended family is 24 voters -- 20 registered Republicans, all of whom will vote for Biden and who all voted for Gov. Kasich [John Kasich of Ohio, a 2016 Republican primary candidate], not Trump. They will never vote for anyone left of Biden," -- Susan Martin, Cincinnati
See you next week
Nick Corasaniti is taking the helm tomorrow, and then we'll be back after the holiday week. I will be indulging in the traditional pastimes of eating, Black Friday shopping and, of course, the requisite viewing of "Frozen 2." (I felt very seen by this reporting.)
Whatever your plans may be, from all of us at the politics desk, may your dinners be satisfying, bellies be full and political conversation be warm -- or, at the very least, civil.
Happy Thanksgiving!

Texto completo: THE BUZZ ON FLORIDA POLITICS

TALLAHASSEE  Florida state Sen. Annette Taddeo will be on 60 Minutes tonight explaining how information stolen by Russian hackers was used against her in her 2016 congressional race.

The Miami Democrat, who has talked about the experience before, is featured prominently in the episode about Russian election interference efforts in 2020.

You know, Ive been told by a lot of people, You should stop talking about this. Its really not good for you politically to remind people that you lost, Taddeo told the show. But I refuse to stop talking about it. Because, again, if it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. And it didnt happen to me: It happened to our democracy.

In 2016, Russian government officials using the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0 stole thousands of pages of documents from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and released them online. The committee works to elect Democrats to Congress, efforts that include vetting them for potential attacks by their opponents.

The information included Taddeos secret internal strategy plan for her 2016 Democratic primary congressional race against former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, according to the New York Times.

The documents also included damaging information about Garcia, according to the Times.

But Taddeo, who lost to Garcia, criticized him for using the information.

My opponent Joe Garcia showed up at that debate with a printout of all the documents, Taddeo said, according to a preview of Sundays episode. Weve seen a lot [in Southern Florida.] But this was a foreign government. This was so much bigger.

Garcia narrowly defeated Taddeo but lost to incumbent Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo.

Taddeo wasnt the only victim of the hacking. The stolen documents included internal opposition research into former Democratic Congresswoman Gwen Graham. While running for governor in 2018, she joked about how little dirt was in the documents.

The hacking of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was part of a larger effort to damage Democrats and help elect Donald Trump in 2016, according to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who last year charged 12 Russian military officials with engaging in cyber operations.

The hackers also stole documents from Hillary Clintons campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The stolen emails eventually forced U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to step down as the committees chairwoman.

Ambassador to Ukraine?

In her new role as a special adviser to President Donald Trump, Pam Bondi was in the spotlight Wednesday morning ahead of the important impeachment hearing testimony.

The former Florida attorney general appeared on CBS This Morning for an interview previewing the appearance of Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the 28-member European Union, at the House impeachment hearing. Only, she got his title wrong. Heres the exchange with co-host Tony Dokoupil:

Dokoupil: Does the president know Gordon Sondland well? Are they in frequent contact? Have they been?

Bondi: Well, were gonna hear what Gordon Sondland has to say today. He was ambassador for a short while.

Dokoupil: What does the president say?

Bondi: The president ... he was ambassador to the Ukraine. He is ambassador to the Ukraine. And the president knows him. The president doesnt know him very well. Hes a short term ambassador, of course he knows him.

Sondland is not ambassador to Ukraine. That position belongs to William Taylor, who testified in the inquiry earlier this week.

Marco Rubios next job?

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., denied rumors Thursday he would leave office early to become secretary of state, after media reports that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is looking to run for a Kansas seat in the Senate.

Responding to questions from Spectrum News in Washington, D.C., Rubio said he intends to complete his current term, which runs until January 2023.

I intend fully to serve my full term here, said Rubio, a former state House speaker who has been in the U.S Senate since 2011. And if I dont, it would be because of some unforeseen personal circumstance or something that no one can foresee now, but it wont be because some other job like that. Im not going to be the secretary of state at any time in the near future.

Rubio said he hasnt been approached about joining the Trump administration.

Somebody keeps promulgating that rumor, probably for their own interests, Rubio said.

Who would say such things?

Well, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, for one.

My former boss @marcorubio would be a historic and amazing Secretary of State, Gaetz tweeted Thursday.

Texto completo: My Mom died Tuesday. As much as I admire her 92 years of life, I remember as a kid thinking life had cheated her at times.
Lois Evaughn Schembs was born on a farm outside of Remington, Indiana, on Jan. 28, 1927, to farmer Jesse Schembs and his wife, Floretta Casey. Mom never said they were poor, but she did tell stories of running to the outhouse in the middle of winter nights and being happy to find a Sears catalog instead of just corn cobs. She’d heat an iron in the fire and use it to warm her bed sheets, but she’d still wake up some mornings to find the water frozen in her glass next to the bed.
She was so smart as a child, she skipped second grade. Then she got scarlet fever and missed so much school, she had to repeat third grade. Good in math and English, she was salutatorian of her Class of 1945 at Remington High School, where she also played the drums.
Of course, old classmates of hers just called her "the prettiest girl in school." They say she should have been queen of the Fountain Park Chautauqua in Remington, but the judges declared it a tie and Mom lost the coin flip.
Second in her class. Second to the queen. And second-class citizen when it came to education, I thought. College was never an option for her, so she took a job in bookkeeping with Sherman White and Co., a buyer of farm goods in Goodland. That’s where she met my dad, Willy Constable, on the day he came home from World War II and stopped by in uniform to see his sister, who introduced him to my mom. He was more than 10 years older, and Mom remembers being mortified when he wore his fedora on their first date to the movie theater, as if he were an old man.
Dad proposed on their third date. Three years later, Mom accepted. But first, she and her younger sister, Dorothy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean in the steerage compartment of a steamship for a grand adventure in Ireland. That took courage. Mom came home and married my dad on March 13, 1950, on what happened to be the first day in weeks that it was too wet for farmers to work. The last-second nuptials meant Willy’s father, Bert, skipped the wedding to attend his previously scheduled town board meeting. A rainy spring extended my parent’s honeymoon.
Mom gave birth to daughters Sally and Nancy, and then me and my brother, Bill. Mom insisted that all of us kids learn to play piano and sing alongside Dad and her in the choir at the Goodland Presbyterian Church. My sisters played organ and piano for church and countless weddings. My brother became a gifted musician and keyboard player who charmed crowds with his music. As the only person in my family who never got paid to perform music, I might be the only kid in history whose mother asked him to stop taking piano lessons. We both thought that was a good idea.
Mom and Dad were key members of the South Newton High School Production Company and got all of us kids interested in theater. They took us to Christmas concerts at Purdue University. They also had good seats for Boilermaker football games, where we’d wrap our feet in plastic bread wrappers to keep warm and Mom would open her stash of homemade chocolate-chip goodies only when our team needed her "third-down cookies." Her only attempt at athletics was standing on her head on her birthdays.
Mom quizzed us on current events and political news at supper and set up an Electoral College voting system for family decisions, with everybody getting votes depending on age. A parental bloc defeated any move by the minority children, but any split opened the door for new alliances. Mom filled our home with books, music, humor and love.
An avid reader, political junkie and crossword wiz, she used to quote from New York Times stories and talk about writing her own book. "I’d call it ‘Hamburger and Sex,’" she said. "Because I know hamburger, and I need sex to make it sell."
In addition to cooking our meals and running the household, Mom was the driving force in getting all four kids to go to college. But she didn’t just inspire her own kids. She had an uncanny ability to draw people to her and consider her their second mom. People confided in her about sexual issues, drugs, abuse, alcoholism and dreams.
She lived on a farm in a conservative, heavily Republican, all-white community, but became a go-to person for anyone from outside those boundaries. She and Dad visited Jimmy Carter’s church in Plains, Georgia. Mom and her friend Ruthann were once in a photo on the front of The Indianapolis Star talking with Jesse Jackson after they made the trip to hear the civil rights leader speak. Mom donated to Barack Obama, slapped an Obama bumper sticker on her car in 2008, and probably deserves credit for making Indiana a blue state that year. No one so much as teased her.
Once we kids were out of her hair, she focused more on herself. She and her friends had frequent Lunch Bunch outings.
In her 70s, she took art classes and became an accomplished watercolor artist, winning a couple of ribbons and landing one piece in a juried art show.
She got back to her drums, too, playing snare drum in the Newton Jasper Community Band from her early 70s through her late 80s.
Lovely and elegant are words often used in descriptions of her. Always polite, Mom never swore or spoke badly about anyone. She never let us kids say the S-word, whether that meant "stupid" or "shut up."
She cared for the old ladies in the church. She cared for her parents. She cared for my dad before he died in 2003. She cared for my brother before he died in 2010. She cared for others her whole life. My thoughts about what she could have been if she had been given the chance vanished. Life didn’t cheat her of opportunities. It let her forge her own.
She had grace, smarts, love and a wonderful life. And we were lucky to be part of it.

Dr. Laura's lasting truths

Texto completo: When Dr. Laura Schlessinger got her foot entangled with shards of broken glass a few months ago, she cleaned the wound, cringed at the amount of blood, and went about her business despite a lingering stinging pain nagging at her to do something.
Apropos of what she does in her professional life as the host of the Dr. Laura program on satellite radio, she yielded to the warning signs and went to the doctor who informed her there were several pieces still lodged in her foot.Image-1.jpgShe had them removed and then kept them as a reminder of sorts to listen to those uncomfortable things we need to address in our lives, and in fact, to look them square in the eye every once in a while, so you don’t make that same mistake twice.
At 72, Schlessinger is many things.
Her 40-year radio career dispensing blunt, pragmatic advice that sometimes pushes, sometimes guides, and sometimes delivers a kick in the gut recently earned her an induction to the National Radio Hall of Fame.
She is also still her kids’ mom, an exhaustive Lego builder, sailor, pool shark, tennis player, jeweler, and power-lifter who also adores her daughter-in-law, loves to hike, go shooting, ride her Harley, and wear as much pink as possible in every way she can.
“On my left shoulder is a beautiful rendition of a skull — not the kind of stuff you see on Hells Angels. It's got a rose in its mouth,” Schlessinger said of the new rose-shaded ink.
“I said to the guy; I'm really kind of a bad-ass girly girl. People kind of keep trying to pin me down. You're this conservative, tight-ass broad. No. I'm not. I'm quite complex. I'll stand by a door all day until the guy opens it. I can kick the door down because I'm a black belt, but I wait for a guy to open it, and I thank him very cordially,” she explains.
Listen to her Sirius XM show with any regularity, and you notice the relationship she has with her listeners is deep, complex, loyal, loving, and connected, oftentimes after delivering a harsh assessment of a listeners problem they will concede, “I knew you were going to tell me that.”
Industry insiders say not only has her popularity not ceded any ground, it has grown, in particular among young conservative women and men.
Her newest book, Love and Life (she has 12 New York Times bestsellers under her belt), is a collection of her columns over the past 15 years that cover a broad spectrum of the complexities of life and love. It's a book of the truths that have stood the test of time in the way a good movie holds up long after the scenery in the world has changed. This is nothing short of astounding, given our rapidly changing culture.
“Frankly, nothing changes. The human heart, the needs of children, the pains of disappointment, frustration, and loss, the expectations not met. The fear of taking on challenges — I mean that and more. That's a constant throughout all humanity from day one in the Bible for goodness sake,” she said.
“And that's why all this holds up because there are some basic truths that regardless of the era and the new popular thought — the truth is there are things women need, there are things men need, there are things children need, there are things parents need, there are things friends need. It doesn't change. It never has,” she says.
She is correct. Humans need words and contact to feel safe. People need to give as a way of feeling good. In short, people need to have a purpose in their lives in order to build a life more meaningful than just accumulating goodies. Our culture today doesn’t agree.
“Our culture is horrible. Look at the meanness. And it comes from our media and the internet in particular because anonymity allows people to have their dark side implemented without any restraint. Human beings need restraint. That's why we have religion, we have rules, we have morality because we're quite aware that we as human beings can run the gamut from compassion domiciled,” she said.
One of her favorite parts of the book is in the afterword, whose subtitle “96 Kinds of People Who Hate Dr. Laura (and Dr. Laura Loves it),” reveals her quirky sense of humor. Schlessinger, whose haters attempted to cancel her long before canceling became a vindictive verb, says they are hilarious. And she’s not wrong.

Signs Of Hope In Treating Severe Mental Illness

Texto completo: There are some crimes that are almost impossible to forget.
For me, they include the death in 1999 of Kendra Webdale, an aspiring young journalist who was pushed in front of a New York subway train by a 29-year-old man with schizophrenia who had stopped taking his medication. That same year, two mentally ill teenage boys massacred 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado.
Thirteen years later, a seriously emotionally disturbed 20-year-old man murdered 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. This year, a homeless 24-year-old man bludgeoned four men to death while they slept on the streets of my city.
Although New York is now far safer than when I was a child in the 1940s and ’50s who walked to and from school unescorted, like most big cities it still harbors untold numbers of men and women with known or undiagnosed severe mental illness that can and should be treated before yet another personal or societal tragedy occurs.
What, I wondered, can be done to help them and avert further disasters?
Contrary to politically motivated claims, I learned that people with serious mental ills are not necessarily prone to commit violent acts - they are far more likely to become victims of crime. Rather, the issue is that treatments known to be effective are underfunded or wrongly dismissed as ineffective or too dangerous; basic research in university and government laboratories into new and better drugs is limited and also underfunded; and pharmaceutical companies have shown little interest in developing and testing treatments for severe mental illness.
Also at issue is that, as was true for cancer until recently, acknowledgment of mental illness carries a stigma that impedes its early recognition, when it can be most effectively treated or reversed.
Early intervention is critical, but even when mental illness is recognized in a family member, the person may resist treatment, often claiming that he or she is not the one who is sick.
As Dr. Kenneth P. Rosenberg recounts in his new book, “Bedlam: An Intimate Journey into America’s Mental Health Crisis,” when the huge, disgraceful psychiatric asylums were shuttered in the mid- to late 1900s, the assumption was that community mental health centers would take over, allowing those with serious mental illness to be treated as outpatients.
But neither the centers nor the communities that housed them were prepared to deal with the influx of extremely needy patients.
Currently, the country’s three largest facilities housing the mentally ill are jails: the Twin Towers in Los Angeles, the Cook County Jail in Chicago and Rikers Island in New York City.
“Mental illness crises are the only health emergency in which law enforcement are the first responders,” Rosenberg, a New York psychiatrist specializing in addiction treatment, writes. “At least 21% of all 992 people who were shot and killed by police in 2018 had a mental illness.” In New York, nearly 500 911 calls a day involve the mentally ill. Last month, in response to the murder of the four homeless men, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $37 million commitment to address this crisis, an amount criticized as a highly inadequate sum.
But Rosenberg and others who specialize in severe psychiatric disease say it doesn’t have to be this way. There is an expanding number of cost- and lifesaving outpatient options available to people with disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression.
But people have to know about them and be willing and able to take advantage of them. One in New York City called OnTrackNY helps to stabilize young people with early signs of mental illness, when the disease is easiest to derail.
Another program, called Navigate, provides comprehensive treatment for people suffering a first psychotic episode to head off full-blown schizophrenia. It includes four critical elements: pharmacology, individual resilience training, family psychoeducation and supported employment.
Nationally, a growing number of programs called assertive community treatment provide the kinds of services offered in psychiatric hospitals but within a home setting, which works for “a certain percentage” of those with severe mental illness, said Kim T. Mueser, director of psychiatric rehabilitation at Boston University.
A major benefit, especially for those who live alone, is making sure patients take their medication as prescribed as well as fulfilling their basic needs.
“Mental illness is highly treatable, and many cases can be completely eliminated with effective treatment, or they can be managed effectively so that people can go on living rewarding and effective lives,” Mueser said.
“When someone’s mind is taken over by psychosis, the consequences are epic,” Rosenberg said. In lieu of jail, he advocates “therapeutic jurisprudence that leverages the mentally ill who tangle with the law toward health, not jail.”
He added, “We need to create laws that are more amenable to getting treatment for people who don’t know they’re sick because people who don’t know they’re sick will fight against treatment. We also need more beds in a place that feels inviting, not a jail by another name.”
A major stumbling block is fear of two of the most effective treatments, especially for patients with severe mental illness who have failed to respond to other remedies: the drug clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). As currently administered, the serious side effects of decades past are avoidable.
Meanwhile, there are resources that can help guide troubled families to needed services, like the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Rosenberg’s book also provides lots of practical advice both in accessing effective medical care and using the law. One suggestion I found intriguing is the creation of a psychiatric advance directive, a form for which is available at nrc-pad.org, to help guide families and therapists when a patient is in the throes of a psychotic episode.

Texto completo: FBI surveillance of a former campaign advisor to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 was marred by bureaucratic mistakes but wasn't illegal or driven by bias within the bureau's leadership, according to people familiar with the findings of an internal investigation.
FBI officials made some sloppy but relatively minor errors when it came to seeking court approval for a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. The issues cited included one lower-level lawyer who altered an email related to the warrant application, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the findings haven't been made public.
Overall, though, the surveillance was legally sound and justified and wasn't the product of political bias against Trump among FBI leaders such as then-Director James B. Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the people said.

The findings, made in a draft report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz, undercut a number of claims made by the president and top allies about alleged "spying" on his campaign and the origins of the inquiry that eventually became part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The findings were first reported Friday by the New York Times. Some of the report's conclusions have been confirmed by Bloomberg, which hasn't seen the draft.
Horowitz has told lawmakers he plans to release the report Dec. 9 and cautioned that some of the findings could change by then. In addition to clarifying whether officials from the FBI or other agencies acted improperly -- as Trump and his supporters have long contended -- the report is expected to address whether any current or former officials should be criminally prosecuted for their actions.
Regardless of the report's conclusion, it will arrive as the president and his political allies are engaged in a fierce political battle amid the House impeachment investigation.
Both Republicans and Democrats are likely to seize on aspects of the report they think will bolster their arguments.
Controversy over the origins of the Russia investigation is partly at the core of the impeachment proceedings. House Democrats began their inquiry following allegations that Trump tried to pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate an unsubstantiated theory that a previous government in Kyiv meddled in the 2016 U.S. election, as well as to announce a probe of one of the president's top potential 2020 challengers, former Vice President Joe Biden.
The FBI, the inspector general's office and the Justice Department all declined to comment.
Horowitz's report found that a low-level lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, altered an email that was used in a package of material to seek court approval to renew the wiretap against Page, according to the New York Times. Clinesmith's lawyer declined to comment to the Times.
Page had previously been flagged by intelligence agencies as a target of Russian interest. The warrant was obtained in October 2016, after Page had left the campaign. The surveillance continued into 2017, after Trump took office.
The New York Times also reported that the draft doesn't corroborate conspiracy theories and insinuations offered by Trump and his allies about the early stages of the Russia investigation. For example, none of the evidence used to open the investigation came from the CIA or from a partly unverified and sometimes salacious dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer, according to the Times.
Republicans have argued that the surveillance applications relied heavily on the so-called Steele dossier.
Separately, Atty. Gen. William Barr is conducting his own investigation into what he's called "spying" on Trump's campaign. That inquiry, led by U.S. Atty. John Durham, isn't expected to be completed soon.
Horowitz said in a June letter to congressional leaders that his office "received and reviewed over 1 million records" and has "conducted over 100 interviews, including current and former DOJ and FBI personnel."
The Justice Department released a redacted version of the Page surveillance applications last year.
Referring to Trump as "Candidate #1," the initial application said that "the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign."

Texto completo: It's time for Broadway to embrace what's most joyous about songbook shows. Not biography, not coherence, but excess. Even "Moulin Rouge!" doesn't quite get it right.
Sometimes, I crave a musical where grandiosity is unencumbered by logic and good taste. I don't need a book that makes sense when I can feast on eye-popping visuals backed by an eardrum-busting sound system. It's O.K. for the brain to take a rest while the senses work overtime. Broadway knew that once, or at least Florenz Ziegfeld did.
Musicals have gotten psychologically complex lately, and I appreciate those, too. Dramatically sensitive and tastefully intimate, "Once," "Fun Home," "Dear Evan Hansen" and "The Band's Visit" are credits to the art form.
But once in a while, I don't want beige; I want a rainbow connection. I want a musical where nutty excess and carefree one-upmanship rule.
A musical in which as many numbers as possible aim straight for the pleasure zone, unperturbed by the need to advance the plot or supply motivation.
A musical where the only possible reaction is: What the hell was that?
Shows based on pop catalogs are well suited to this approach, because those songs tend not to be tethered to a narrative arc, leaving directors and writers the freedom to go wild.
Many such musicals use the songbooks to tell the life stories of the artists that made them famous. They often wrestle with how to make the music fit -- or, as Jesse Green put it in his New York Times review of "Tina: The Tina Turner Musical," "songs bent into improbable shapes to serve a story they weren't designed for."
So edifying. So (mostly) dull. Why even bother?
In the past six months, however, New Yorkers have been treated to three productions that don't shy away from pop and rock excess. The best ones did more: They reveled in it.
The season of clobbering maximalism began with the July opening of "Moulin Rouge!" on Broadway, and continued when the tour of Jim Steinman's "Bat Out of Hell" made a pit stop at New York City Center the following month. The trifecta was completed when "We Will Rock You," which retrofits Queen songs, finally made its New York City debut this month with six performances at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden. Appropriately, the show, a huge hit in the West End, had its American premiere in Las Vegas, in 2004.
"Moulin Rouge!," based on Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film, is a doomed love story set in a fantastical Paris around the turn of the 20th century. It boasts a Frankenscore made up of bits and pieces from a whopping 70 hits -- about a third of them crammed into a medley in which nearly every line is pulled from a different song.
The other two shows rely on single musical sources. Meat Loaf's original "Bat Out of Hell" album, written by Steinman, came out in 1977, and was based on a concept the songwriter had started working on in the late 1960s. The musical's book incorporates several other Steinman songs, and happens to be oddly similar to the unabashedly comical one Ben Elton cooked up for "We Will Rock You." Both are set in a dystopian future where handsome young dudes lead the charge against a repressive order.
Of this trio, the sci-fi-flavored productions got closest to the sweet spot because they fully committed to the cray-cray. "Moulin Rouge!," on the other hand, distrusts its own musical DNA.
Two out of three ain't bad, as Steinman once wrote.
Whereas the other productions were touring -- safely distant from the withering glare of New York theater critics, who are not, as a whole, known for rocking out -- "Moulin Rouge!" is perched on Broadway.
That makes it, on paper at least, the "classy" offering in the bunch. The cast and creative team are stuffed with Tony winners. The sets are jaw-droppingly outlandish; the striking costumes are richly evocative for the men, evocative for the women. The budget for Brazilian waxing alone must be staggering.
Yet to me "Moulin Rouge!" is all wrapper, no candy.
Like the film, the musical adopts a chop-shop approach to its set list. But at least Luhrmann managed to convey a blend of irreverence and affection for his material -- a telltale sign was his casting of the pop star Kylie Minogue, known for her own flamboyant spectacles, as the Green Fairy.
There is no such love in the Broadway show. The book writer John Logan and the director Alex Timbers treat the songs as interchangeable parts whose sums don't matter. A telling detail in The New York Times story about clearing the rights was the production's attitude expressed in this quote: "We're willing to walk away. Not one song has to make the show."
That's because too often the show doesn't take the songs seriously. It even works against the performers who, with a few exceptions like Karen Olivo's belting of "Firework," never maintain the momentum to make the most of their material.
"Moulin Rouge!" is the first Broadway blockbuster made for the age of Shazam and TikTok, a giant live quiz where audience members gasp in self-congratulatory appreciation each time they identify a snippet. It's a cruel irony since in the last decade streaming has rejuvenated the art of the pop song, freeing it from the need to fit on an album.
To stage excess well, you have to love it unconditionally. "Moulin Rouge!" is too ambivalent for that, perhaps reflecting Broadway's ingrained diffidence toward pop music.
"Bat Out of Hell" and "We Will Rock You," on the other hand, don't have any qualms. (It's worth noting that both productions originated in Britain, where the relationship between musical theater and popular music is less fraught -- that is the country that also gave us "Mamma Mia!" after all.)
Queen and Steinman always sound big. Then again, these are two acts who bloomed in the 1970s -- a fertile decade for the outlandish rock operas that were pop's answer to two fading (at the time) genres: classical music and musical theater.
Steinman, in particular, has the ability to combine melodic accessibility and saga-like length in his songs -- he is the Wagner of the teenage wasteland, his songs bloated and addictive. Whereas "Moulin Rouge!" mines extreme fragmentation, "Bat Out of Hell" bets on extended numbers that constantly blur the line between earnest and tongue-in-cheek.
Steinman and the director Jay Scheib understood that holding back was not an option. (Full disclosure: I have written for Arts at MIT, where Scheib teaches.)
Set in the futuristic city of Obsidian, "Bat Out of Hell" matched the handsome, frequently shirtless Strat with the goth babe Raven. He was the leader of a group of mutants stuck in perpetual adolescence while her father, Falco, ruled Obsidian.
Or maybe he was just some sort of omnipotent business tycoon? It wasn't all that important. What mattered was that this breathlessly crazy show featured desperate love and doomed motorcycle runs, wall-to-wall arias of lust and despair. It had little regard for the rules of the Broadway musical.
So what if the show was, to quote one of its songs, "all revved up with no place to go"? It's not where the ride took you, it's how -- and how loudly.
A similar anything-goes philosophy drove "We Will Rock You." The show took place in a future where Earth, now called iPlanet, is run by an evil conglomerate and its C.E.O., Killer Queen. She's named Killer Queen because she sings "Killer Queen." That's it.
Here, as in "Bat," a revolution was brewing. The resisters included Galileo Figaro and Scaramouche; other outcasts, called the Bohemians, worshiped the hazy memory of something called rock music via salvaged totemic artifacts like a "vy-day-oh tappee" -- they didn't know how to pronounce it and, dear reader, that made me laugh.
The show moved from song to song with a dreamlike quality, which is a polite way to say it didn't make much sense. And like all roads lead to Rome, here all plot strands led to a grand finale of "We Will Rock You," "We Are the Champions" and "Bohemian Rhapsody" -- the latter so hard to integrate into a story even this far-fetched that Elton didn't even try and just tacked it on as an encore.
Tellingly, reviews from the theater press for the Steinman and Queen shows have not been kind -- although Alexis Soloski captured the wonderfully loony appeal of "Bat" in the Times.
But these productions are valiant, often valid attempts to reconcile musical theater and the pop format. At their best, they leave room for giddy star turns: In "Bat," Andrew Polec and Lena Hall blasted their way through the songs' peaks and valleys like hammy rock gods, while as Killer Queen, Krystle Chance propelled "Another One Bites the Dust" into orbit.
And each show -- yes, even "Moulin Rouge!" for a few blessed minutes -- reminds us how a singularly crafted pop song can make you feel as if it had been written especially for you, while creating an outsize sense of shared universality. That is no small feat.
Despite my preferences, "Moulin Rouge!" of all three shows is the Broadway smash. But I hold out hope for the next musical that really gets the balance right.
Perhaps it will be "KPOP," which is holding casting calls for a potential Broadway move, after a successful if brief Off Broadway run in 2017.
The show has an original score (by Helen Park and Max Vernon) and story (by Jason Kim), about the inner workings of a K-pop factory. But what made it stand out was a sophisticated understanding of how pop music functions as sensory overload and emotional release, culminating in a finale that was a gratuitous, indulgent, loud explosion of pure joy.
That's as good as musical theater can be.

Texto completo: Feeling grateful has many benefits, but they aren't needed when you're already surrounded by friends and family.
As a psychologist, I've spent the past 15 years studying how gratitude shapes people's lives. Research, including my own, has shown that feeling grateful has positive effects on our behavior -- making us more honest, increasing our self-control, enhancing our productivity at work and our relationships at home.
Given that, you might expect me to think that Thanksgiving is one of the most important days of the year. After all, if there's a day on which the benefits of gratitude are maximized, surely it's the national holiday set aside for the purpose of expressing that emotion.
But truth be told, gratitude is wasted on Thanksgiving. Don't get me wrong: I love the rhythms and rituals of the day as much as anyone. It's just that the very things that make Thanksgiving so wonderful -- the presence of family and friends, the time off from work, indulging in that extra serving of turkey -- also make gratitude unnecessary.
Consider that one of gratitude's central purposes is to help us form strong bonds with other people. Research by the psychologist Sara Algoe has shown that when we feel grateful for other people's thoughtfulness, we consider that they might be worth getting to know a little better. Gratitude pushes us to take the first steps in forming relationships with new people. And once we know people better, continued feelings of gratitude strengthen our ties to them. Feeling grateful to one person for a favor also makes us more likely to "pay forward" favors to others we don't know -- a phenomenon identified by the psychologist Monica Bartlett -- which, in turn, can lead them to want to get to know us.
But as we sit around the Thanksgiving table with family and friends, we are not typically looking to seek out other people and form new relationships. On that day, we are already among those we hold dear.
To be clear, I'm not saying that taking time to reflect on and show appreciation for the good in life isn't worthwhile. It's surely a noble act. But from a scientific perspective -- where emotions exist to nudge our decisions and behaviors toward certain ends -- the benefits that gratitude offers tend to be rendered irrelevant on the day it's most expressed.
Here's another example. Work from my lab has shown that feeling grateful helps keep us honest. When my colleagues and I asked people to report whether a coin they flipped in private came up heads or tails (heads meant they'd get more money), those who had been made to feel grateful (by counting their blessings) cheated at half the rate of others. (We knew who cheated because the coin was rigged to come up tails.)
Gratitude also makes us more generous: When people in our experiments were given an opportunity to share money with strangers, we found that those feeling gratitude shared 12 percent more on average.
Yet on Thanksgiving, cheating and stinginess aren't sins we're usually tempted to commit. (Unless you count my taking too big a serving of Aunt Donna's famous stuffing.)
Self-control is also something gratitude enhances. Research by me and my colleagues found that people feeling grateful made less impulsive financial choices -- they were more willing to be patient for future investment gains than to take smaller amounts of money in hand. This self-control also applies to eating: As the psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky and her colleagues showed, people feeling grateful are better able to resist consuming unhealthy foods.
But of course on Thanksgiving, self-control isn't the point. No one needs a reminder to put more money in her retirement account; the banks are closed. And if I can't be a bit gluttonous with Aunt Amy's pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving, when can I?
Gratitude also drives us to be more productive. The psychologists Adam Grant and Francesca Gino found that when bosses expressed gratitude for their workers' efforts in a fund-raising department, the outreach efforts of those workers suddenly jumped by 33 percent. More frequent feelings of gratitude in the office are also tied to greater feelings of work satisfaction and well-being.
Again, this is all great. But unless you're in the hospitality industry, you're probably not working on Thanksgiving.
There's one other benefit of gratitude I want to point out: It reduces materialism. As work by the psychologist Nathaniel Lambert has demonstrated, feeling more gratitude not only increases people's satisfaction with their lives; it also lowers their cravings for buying stuff. This finding jibes with research by the psychologist Thomas Gilovich that shows that people tend to be more grateful for time spent with others than for gifts of big-ticket items.
But on Thanksgiving, avoiding impulse buys isn't usually a big concern. (The following day, Black Friday, is another story.)
So as you and your loved ones gather for Thanksgiving this year, consider that the joys of the day -- the delicious food, the family and friends, the sense of peace -- come relatively easily. We're supposed to gather, support one another and relax on that fourth Thursday of November.
Yet on the other 364 days of the year -- the ones when you might feel lonely, stressed at work, tempted to dishonesty or stinginess -- pausing to cultivate a sense of gratitude can make a big difference. Gratitude may not be needed on Thanksgiving, but giving thanks on other days can help ensure that in the future, you'll have many things to be grateful for.

Texto completo: One of the best movies of 2019, Mary Harron's "Charlie Says," evokes counterculture of the late '60s with relevance for today.
Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" marked the 50th anniversary of the grisly Manson murders with considerable panache. But it's the other Manson movie released this year, the less ballyhooed independent "Charlie Says," that feels timelier.
Directed by Mary Harron from a script by Guinevere Turner, "Charlie Says" surpasses "Once Upon a Time" in evoking the New Age fantasies and apocalyptic mentality of the late 1960s, partly because it plumbs the mind-set of Manson's female followers.
Like Harron's first feature, "I Shot Andy Warhol" (1996), a movie about Warhol's would-be assassin Valerie Solanas, "Charlie Says" is a scrupulous work of pop scholarship resurrecting a larger-than-life character from the lunatic fringe of the '60s counterculture, along with an era-defining celebrity crime.
As she did with her Warhol film, Harron starts "Charlie Says" with the aftermath of a sensational attack. Leslie Van Houten (Hannah Murray), renamed Lulu by Manson, who routinely rechristened his acolytes, is introduced showering off the blood of a couple she had just met and helped to kill. Her three other accomplices from the so-called Manson family, meanwhile, scarf down food in the kitchen of the murdered couple, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.
Ditching their bloodstained clothes, they hitch a ride back to the family hide-out at the Spahn Movie Ranch, a sometime film set in outer Los Angeles. In a conversation about music with a hippie who picks them up, Lulu declares that "everything is a put-on." She may be defending the eccentric performer Tiny Tim, but her retort articulates the disassociation that Manson espoused. "Nothing is real," as the Beatles put it. "Nothing to get hung about."
Fast forward three years: Lulu, Sadie (Marianne Rendón) and Katie (Sosie Bacon) serenade one another with Charlie's songs in the maximum-security prison where they occupy a separate wing. Blissfully brainwashed, they quote Manson's words at every opportunity. Karlene Faith (Merritt Wever), a grad student who teaches at the prison, is assigned to work with them. (The movie is drawn partly from her book "The Long Prison Journey of Leslie Van Houten.") She begins by giving them copies of the 1970 feminist anthology "Sisterhood Is Powerful" only to discover that Manson forbade his "girls" to read anything other than the Bible.
Shuttling back and forth between prison and the ranch, "Charlie Says" is a battle of rival worldviews -- Manson's indoctrination of the young women he recruited is juxtaposed with Faith's dogged attempt to "give them back themselves." Matt Smith's Charlie "isn't especially attractive and doesn't read as remotely charismatic," Manohla Dargis noted in her New York Times review. Yet, there's a rainbow over the ranch when Leslie (not yet named Lulu) first arrives, as if to suggest that charisma is in the eye of the beholder.
The filmmakers Harron and Turner both experienced commune culture. (Turner, brought up in the Boston-based Fort Hill Community, has written about her childhood; in her youth, Harron lived briefly in the East Village "film kibbutz," Total Impact.) Both understand the gravitational force of a designated leader and a shared worldview, as well as the heady conviction of belonging to an elect.
Manson's songs may have been doggerel, but he was a master of manipulative hippie jargon. (Charlie says ...) If his cult was less organized than Jim Jones's Peoples Temple, his megalomania was no less seductive -- the ego-obliteration that Manson promoted went down just as easily as Jones's cyanide-laced Kool-Aid. Because Manson's appeal is presented as a manifestation of his followers' insecurities, "Charlie Says" feels as relevant as any American movie released this year. Depicting the spell Manson cast over his followers, Harron and Turner have much to say about the #MeToo movement, white nationalism, the power of denial, and the ability of a gifted con man to exploit the vulnerable.
"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood" has a blatantly counterfactual finale -- the right people die! "Charlie Says," too, has a counterfactual ending. But unlike Tarantino's film, Harron's makes clear that there is no escaping history. Faith, the prison therapist, knows that should she succeed in freeing Lulu, Sadie and Katie from their illusions, they will be left with the horror of what they did.
Harron began her professional career writing for the fanzine Punk. All but one of her films have journalistic hooks, most lend themselves to cult appreciation, and while she does not identify as a feminist, her movies all raise feminist issues.
"I Shot Andy Warhol," which concerns a murderous man hater, is an obvious example. "American Psycho" (2000), adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's openly misogynist best seller, turns the book on its head, transforming the notion of a status-obsessed yuppie serial sex killer into the anti-masculinist satire Ellis claims it always was. (The movie was controversial; Harron defended its violence in a Times essay.) Lighter in tone, although not without its dark side, "The Notorious Bettie Page" (2006) portrays the enigmatic 1950s pinup and bondage queen as sweet-natured and God-fearing, and impervious to exploitation.
The most conventional of Harron's movies, "The Moth Diaries" (2011), a young-adult story set in a girls' boarding school, enriches vampire lore by integrating teen suicide, self-cutting and anorexia. In her Times review, Jeannette Catsoulis called the movie a "Gothic stew of satisfying kinkiness if unsatisfying resolution." What's even more unsatisfying is the reality that a filmmaker as thoughtful, lively and talented as Harron has made only five features in 23 years.
"Charlie Says" currently streams on Amazon Prime, Vudu and iTunes. "American Psycho," "The Notorious Bettie Page" and "The Moth Diaries" on these sites and more; "I Shot Andy Warhol" unfortunately not at all. "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" will be widely available on Nov. 26.

Haven't we seen this show before?

Texto completo: DETROIT - U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has done remarkably well - so far - in the Democratic primary battle and has led in some polls in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

She may, especially if Bernie Sanders falters, win the nomination in Milwaukee next July.

But here's something you might consider:

Once upon a time, there was a liberal Democratic senator from Massachusetts who won the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary easily, and then swept to the nomination.

His opponent was a largely unpopular Republican president who had deeply divided the country. Democrats thought they could smell victory. On Election Day, their candidate did sweep the northeast and the Pacific west. But except for Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, he lost everything else - and the presidential election.

His name was John Kerry, and that was 2004.

Once upon another time, there was a Democratic candidate from Massachusetts who made a better-than-expected showing in Iowa, swept New Hampshire, and breezed to the nomination.

By summer, he was 17 points ahead in the polls, and the race looked about over. But then the Republican spin doctors went to work on his record, and his campaign went into a tailspin. In the end, he lost 40 states. His name was Michael Dukakis, and that was 1988.

Now, it is a new century, and one of the front-running candidates for the Democratic nomination is Ms. Warren, another liberal senator from, yes, Massachusetts who is leading in some polls in early key states. Every election is different, of course.

The political landscape isn't the same as it was in 1988 or even 2004. But it would be hard to blame any Democrat who looks at this and asks themselves - haven't we seen this show before?

Doesn't it have an unhappy ending?

This analysis could be faulty. No two campaigns are the same, and most people are still not paying a lot of attention.

To be sure, nobody like Donald Trump has ever been in the White House, and given his negative approval ratings and other obvious weaknesses, an economic downturn could possibly doom his reelection no matter who the Democrats run.

But a New York Times/Siena College poll released Nov. 5 indicates that nominating Elizabeth Warren could be the biggest gift the Democrats could give Mr. Trump. Their survey showed former Vice President Joe Biden beating Mr. Trump in virtually every swing state, except for North Carolina.

In the poll, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont led the president narrowly in the three states that decided the last election, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. But Ms. Warren trailed in every swing state except Arizona.

Polls are notoriously unreliable, especially this early in any election cycle, and a Washington Post-ABC News poll the same day showed Ms. Warren with a 55 to 40 percent lead over Mr. Trump.

But even that poll showed the more moderate former vice-president Joe Biden doing better. The New York Times survey found that many voters just did not like Ms. Warren, some because they did not like her Medicare for all health insurance plan; others because they disliked her personality or speaking style.

Some said they felt like she was lecturing them; others, like Elysha Savarese, a 26-year-old Floridian, said I just don't feel like she's a genuine candidate. I find her body language to be very off-putting. She's very cold -… basically a Hillary Clinton clone.

That may be unfair, and it is clear from Warren rallies that many women and men adore her.

There are also a few older Democrats who note that John F. Kennedy was a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, and he was elected. That is true - but it also was six decades ago.

Mr. Kennedy, who was perceived as a middle-of-the-road moderate, could count on states like Louisiana and Arkansas and Georgia that no Democrat - certainly not one on the left - has much if any hope of winning today. Additionally, the playing field is different.

Voting strength and electoral votes have shifted dramatically from the Northeast, which was and is JFK's and Ms. Warren's base, to the South and West. New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts had a combined 93 electoral votes in 1960. They have a mere 60 today.

Florida, which President Kennedy (and Hillary Clinton) narrowly lost, had 10 electoral votes in 1960; it has 29 today. Geography has become less favorable to a Massachusetts Democrat.

The day after Paul Tsongas won the 1992 Democratic primary, the legendary Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a often irreverent Democrat, dryly told a friend of mine, So they want to give us another liberal from Massachusetts, and this one has a lisp.

Democrats did not, however, nominate Mr. Tsongas, but instead chose Bill Clinton, the governor of Arkansas who was perceived as a moderate. That fall, he won.

History does not always repeat itself. But it does, sometimes, provide signposts for the future.

New York Times memory-holes its own report that Ukraine interfered in 2016 election

Texto completo: Now that the public is finally getting around to acknowledging that Ukraine's government did insert itself in the 2016 election for the purpose of hurting President Trump's campaign, the national media are pretending that it didn't happen.
In the case of the New York Times, they're pretending that they themselves weren't the ones to initially report on it.
A Times report on Friday said that the "charges" over Ukraine's election meddling originated with — where else? Russia.
The story said that "American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election."
Interesting. Did that "yearslong campaign" extend back to August 2016, when the Times broke the story that an entire Ukrainian government agency was investigating Paul Manafort, who at the time was serving as Trump's campaign chairman?
Back then, the paper reported that Ukraine’s "newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau," which worked in conjunction with America's FBI, was in possession of a mysterious, handwritten diary that showed Manafort was receiving millions of dollars in payments from one of the country's pro-Russian politicians. "Investigators assert," the Times reported, "that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials."
If that report was part of a larger disinformation campaign by Russia, I'd like to know when the Times plans on issuing a retraction.
We're supposed to believe that Ukraine's government, completely by coincidence, happened upon this little notebook — literally found in the ashes of a burned-down building — that exposed Manafort as a money launderer. We're supposed to believe that this was a matter of fate, not a form of retaliation against Trump, who had been saying positive things about Russia.
Yeah, I don't believe any of that.
This was Ukraine's most consequential government agency investigating the top official in a major candidate's presidential campaign. The Times report on Friday, however, dismissed Ukraine's documented and consequential interference as "scattershot."
Welcome to 1984.

Beware the federal “Grinch” during the season of giving

Texto completo: It’s officially the holiday shopping season. But be wary. Your Grinch neighbor, the IRS, is sitting high on the mountain, waiting to pounce. When money or items of value change hands, the IRS often wants a share, and believe it or not, it includes gift-giving.
The basic rules
A recipient of a gift does not pay income taxes on the gift. But the donor may pay gift or estate taxes. These taxes work together but are two different taxes, separate and apart from income taxes. A gift tax applies to gifts made during your lifetime, paid by the donor and not the recipient.
Estate tax applies to transfers at your death, paid by the decedent’s estate, not the recipient. There is one tax exemption for both these taxes. Currently, the exemption is $11.4 million, so you can give that amount away during your life or at your death, or some combination thereof, without gift or estate taxes.
Additionally, anyone can give another person a gift of up to $15,000 a year. That means spouses can together gift $30,000 per year. After that, the gift is subject to gift tax and you’ll need to use part of your exemption.
How it works
If you gift, for example, $25,000 to your adult child, $10,000 is a potentially taxable gift. You would need to file a gift tax return and claim a portion of your lifetime exemption, leaving you with $11,390,000 still to gift during your lifetime or at your death without taxes. An amount beyond that is taxed at 40%, and you or your estate pays that tax, not the recipient.
You may think that with an exemption that high you have nothing to worry about. — gift away! (Please add me to your list.) But beware that the exemption amount is scheduled to drop to about $5.4 million after 2025. Expect to see a lot of serious gifting by the wealthy in 2025 to use up the larger exemption that will disappear the following year.
What could go wrong?
There can be a lot of reasons to gift during your lifetime: your kid needs the money, you need to drop an asset from your estate, you’re downsizing and would like to see your child and grandchildren live in the family home. But beware that besides the potential for a gift tax, there’s an income tax issue, too.
Unlike property inherited due to death, gifted property keeps the same tax basis the donor had. Say you have stock you paid $25,000 for that is now worth $50,000. If the stock is given to your heirs, it would have an income tax basis of $50,000. If they sold the stock, they’d have no taxable gain. If you instead gift that stock during your lifetime, the recipient gets your same tax basis of $25,000. If they sell the stock, they will have a taxable gain of $25,000. This may work fine if the recipient is in a low tax bracket or is a tax-free charity. Just do the analysis with your advisors before making a gift of an appreciated asset. Timing is everything.
Other Gift Tax Exemptions
There are other gifts that can be made without incurring gift tax. Gifts to pay for someone else’s medical expenses or tuition, gifts to a spouse and gifts to charity do not incur gift tax no matter the amount and are not subject to the annual $15,000 limit. But again, be cautious. The Grinch is rubbing his green paws together.
A gift of tuition for all levels of education is not subject to gift tax, but the exemption, known as the Gift Tax Exclusion for Tuition, only applies if you make the payment directly to the institution and not the student and keep documentation. The exemption does not include gifts for housing, books, supplies, or meals. The gift may also affect the student’s eligibility for financial aid.
Payment of medical expenses is excluded from gift tax only if the bill is incurred for “the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and is not covered by insurance.
Gifts between spouses are not subject to tax. But a gift from a spouse becomes the separate property of the recipient. You would not get half of it back if you divorce. (This is a Grinch of a different color, but relevant here.) Additional rules apply if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen.
Charitable gifts aren’t subject to gift tax, and you can get an income tax deduction if you itemize. But your deduction for charitable gifts is limited to 60% of your adjusted gross income, 30% in some cases.
Conclusion
Gifting to your loved ones or charity is, of course, a wonderful thing. My gift to you is simply to remind you that sometimes gifts need to be carefully planned out with professional advisors so it makes it to the Whos in your Whoville without the Grinch grabbing a chunk. The IRS is a mean one.

Texto completo: Why the president must be impeached and removed.
Donald Trump ought to be impeached and removed from office. This isn't what I thought two months ago, when the impeachment inquiry began. I argued that the evidence fell short of the standards of a prosecutable criminal act. I also feared impeachment might ultimately help Trump politically, as it had helped Bill Clinton in 1998. That second worry might still prove true.
But if the congressional testimonies of Marie Yovanovitch, Bill Taylor, Gordon Sondland, Alexander Vindman and especially Fiona Hill make anything clear, it's that the president's highest crime isn't what he tried to do to, or with, Ukraine.
It's that he's attempting to turn the United States into Ukraine. The judgment Congress has to make is whether the American people should be willing, actively or passively, to go along with it.
I've followed Ukrainian politics fairly closely since 1999, when I joined the staff of The Wall Street Journal Europe. It has consistent themes that should sound familiar to American ears.
The first theme is the criminalization of political differences. Years before Trump led his followers in "Lock Her Up" chants against Hillary Clinton, then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych did exactly that against his own political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, who was sentenced to seven years in prison on a variety of byzantine charges after she had narrowly lost the 2010 election.
She spent three years in prison before her release during the 2014 Maidan Revolution. Key to Yanukovych's efforts to discredit Tymoshenko was -- who else? -- Paul Manafort.
A second theme is the use of political office as a shield against criminal prosecution and as a vehicle for personal and familial enrichment. Why have so many of Ukraine's oligarchs -- including Burisma Holdings founder Mykola Zlochevsky -- also served as government ministers? Simple: Because, until recently, it shielded them from criminal prosecution thanks to parliamentary immunity, while also providing them with the means to use government power for their own benefit.
The third theme is what one might call the netherworldization of political life, in which conspiracy theories abound, off-stage figures yield outsized influence, and channels of formal authority are disconnected from the real centers of power.
This reality came vividly to light in 2016, when a parliamentary effort to vote "no confidence" in the government of then-Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk unexpectedly collapsed, thanks to the usual string-pulling from the country's wealthiest power brokers. As Ukrainian political commentator Maxim Eristavi noted at the time, in Ukraine "There are no party lines, no real policy debates, no ideological clashes: just cold-hearted vested interests and short-term alliances between various oligarchic groups."
The fourth theme is covert Russian interference, usually facilitated by local actors.
Ukraine offers the world's most extreme example of this kind of interference (nearby Georgia is a close second), since large parts of the country have been seized outright by Russia and its proxies. But long before the Kremlin's "little green men" arrived in Crimea in 2014, Russia and its agents were using every dirty trick at their disposal, from poisoning a future Ukrainian president with dioxin to poisoning the media landscape with disinformation. Too often, it worked, whether because its victims were suggestible, corrupt, fearful or simply not paying attention.
That last point was also made by Fiona Hill in her testimony on Thursday, where she warned members of the House Intelligence Committee that they ran the risk of themselves falling victims to "politically driven falsehoods," regarding a bogus theory about Ukrainian political interference, "that so clearly advance Russian interests."
Yet the person who is both the principal consumer and purveyor of those falsehoods is the president of the United States, just as he has been a purveyor of so many other conspiracy theories. Even now, this should astound us.
It doesn't, because we've been living in a country undergoing its own dismal process of Ukrainianization: of treating fictions as facts; and propaganda as journalism; and political opponents as criminals; and political offices as business ventures; and personal relatives as diplomatic representatives; and legal fixers as shadow cabinet members; and extortion as foreign policy; and toadyism as patriotism; and fellow citizens as "human scum"; and mortal enemies as long-lost friends -- and then acting as if all this is perfectly normal. This is more than a high crime. It's a clear and present danger to our security, institutions, and moral hygiene.
It's to the immense credit of ordinary Ukrainians that, in fighting Russian aggression in the field and fighting for better governance in Kyiv, they have shown themselves worthy of the world's support. And it's to the enduring shame of the Republican Party that they have been willing to debase our political standards to the old Ukrainian level just when Ukrainians are trying to rise to our former level.
The one way to stop this is to make every effort to remove Trump from office. It shouldn't have to wait a year.

Texto completo: "MCAS has to go," a manager at Canada's aviation regulator said in an email to global peers, referring to software in the Boeing plane.
A manager at Canada's aviation regulator believes that Boeing should remove software that played a role in two deadly crashes of its 737 Max before the plane is cleared to fly again, according to emails between global aviation regulators this week that were reviewed by The New York Times.
The Max has been grounded since March, days after a crash in Ethiopia. Together, the two accidents killed 346 people and have sent Boeing into a crisis. The company is working furiously to get the Max back in service with a fix to the software system, known as MCAS.
"The only way I see moving forward at this point, is that MCAS has to go," the official, Jim Marko, the manager in aircraft integration and safety assessment at Transport Canada Civil Aviation, wrote in the email. He sent the email on Tuesday to officials at the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Brazil's National Civil Aviation Agency.
At least one F.A.A. employee shares his concerns, according to a separate email reviewed by The Times.
Linh Le, a system safety engineer at the F.A.A., shared Mr. Marko's message with others at the agency. He noted that the Canadian official believed that "MCAS introduces catastrophic hazards that weren't there before," that "it and the fix add too much complexity," that "there have been many revisions to the software" and that "each was a band-aid."
Mr. Le said he had similar misgivings about Boeing's proposed fix for the Max. "I have held similar perspective (questioning the need for MCAS, at least from the system safety standpoint)," he said in the email to colleagues. It is unclear whether international regulators will take any action in response to Mr. Marko's concerns.
In his email, Mr. Marko said he was writing the other regulators because he wanted "to get some confidence back to us all that we as Authorities can sleep at night when that day comes when the MAX returns to service."
He expressed concern that regulators might accept the update to MCAS even as issues with the fix kept cropping up. "This leaves me with a level of uneasiness that I cannot sit idly by and watch it pass by," Mr. Marko wrote.
Mr. Marko's email included a PowerPoint presentation expanding on his argument and outlining how Boeing might remove MCAS from the Max. He noted that public confidence in the Max was "LOW."
In a statement on Friday, Boeing said, "We continue to work with the F.A.A. and global regulators to provide them the information they are requesting to certify the Max for safe return to service."
Transport Canada said Friday that Mr. Marko's position had not been subject to systematic review by the agency.
"The email reflects working-level discussions between highly trained aircraft certification experts of key aviation authorities who have been given wide latitude for assessing all issues and looking at all alternatives for the safe return to service of the aircraft," Nicholas Robinson, director general of Transport Canada, said in a statement.
An F.A.A. spokesman, Lynn Lunsford, said in a statement: "The F.A.A. and its international partners have engaged in robust discussions at various stages in this process as part of the thorough scrutiny of Boeing's work. This email is an example of those exchanges."
The National Civil Aviation Agency of Brazil said it had "received the email and will consider the content along with the studies being conducted on the subject."
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
International regulators have given no indication that they will require Boeing to remove MCAS from the Max, and Boeing has not proposed that as a potential solution to problems with the plane. Removing MCAS, as Mr. Marko suggests, would further delay the plane's return.
The 737 Max is Boeing's best-selling plane. But less than 18 months after it began commercial service, a Max crashed off the coast of Indonesia when MCAS activated because of erroneous data, repeatedly pushing the nose of the plane down. Less than five months later, another Max crashed in Ethiopia under similar circumstances.
After the first crash, Boeing announced that it would update MCAS to make it less powerful and reliant on multiple sensors, instead of just one. But that fix was not completed before the second crash.
Over the past eight months, Boeing has encountered numerous delays as it has worked with the F.A.A. and other global regulators to complete the update to MCAS. The company has been signaling that the F.A.A. could approve the new software as soon as December. But engineers at the agency's Seattle office have been frustrated in recent months by pressure from the company and their own managers to speed the process along.
Last week, Stephen Dickson, the F.A.A. administrator, acknowledged that some agency employees were feeling pressure to get the Max flying again. He released a video directing employees to "take the time you need" to conduct a methodical review of the plane.

Texto completo: Ballard Partners — the lobbying firm headed by top Tallahassee and Washington influencer Brian Ballard — and others in President Donald Trump’s fundraising network have been subpoenaed as part of an investigation of associates of Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The Ballard firm isn’t alone: “FBI agents have knocked on the doors of others involved with Republican campaigns,” CNN also reported Wednesday.
Sources told CNN subpoenas were sent to Paul Okoloko, “an executive with a Nigerian fertilizer company who lives in Florida,” and Meredith O’Rourke, “a prominent Florida GOP fundraiser who worked with the Trump Victory Fund.” Neither has publicly confirmed they had received the subpoenas.
“There is no indication that those who have received subpoenas or agreed to provide documents or interviews are suspected of wrongdoing,” the Times reported.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Soviet-born Florida businessmen and American citizens, “helped Giuliani wage a pressure campaign on Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry” into Trump, the Times reported.
Parnas and Fruman — who tried insinuating themselves into GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ inner circle — are charged with violating federal campaign finance laws in an unrelated matter; they have pleaded not guilty.
Ballard Partners, headquartered in Tallahassee with offices throughout the state and in Washington, last year paid Parnas “at least $22,500 for referring business from the Turkish government,” according to the Times. The firm has had no dealings with either man since.
Requests for comment from tallahassee.com were pending Thursday morning with Ballard and William W. Taylor III, the firm’s Washington-based lawyer.
Taylor confirmed to the Times that Parnas had referred the Turkish government to Ballard for lobbying services.
The attorney said in a statement to the paper: “Ballard Partners is cooperating with a United States Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York investigation. It has received a subpoena and is complying.”
Ballard, dubbed “the most powerful lobbyist in Trump’s Washington” earlier this year by Politico, spent decades building relationships and business in Florida. The firm now is in its namesake Ballard building, a new multimillion-dollar tower in downtown Tallahassee.

Texto completo: A black South Bend, Indiana, city councilman endorsed Joe Biden for president rather than Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of the city.
Oliver Davis is a current member and former vice president of the nine-person Common Council and one of its longest-serving African American members.
“In times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it’s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country. That’s why I am very pleased to support Vice President Joe Biden to be our next President of the United States of America,” Davis said in a statement from the Biden campaign Friday.
The endorsement highlights Buttigieg's struggle to gain support from black voters and the shadow of his troubled relationship with the black community in South Bend. His program to quickly demolish and repair vacant houses sparked anger in minority communities and inspired South Bend Councilwoman Regina Williams-Preston to seek public office. In June, a killing of a black man by a white South Bend police officer sparked protests over Buttigieg's handling of policing in minority communities.
Buttigieg lags behind other top-tier Democratic presidential hopefuls in securing major endorsements. He has only six endorsements from current or former black or Hispanic elected officials, according to the New York Times, while Biden has 154, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has 91, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has 43.

Network could deliver wind power across southern New England

Texto completo: The company that is turning the site of a former coal-burning power plant in Somerset into a green energy center has filed a federal application to develop a single transmission network that could deliver power from offshore wind farms to Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.
Anbaric, a Wakefield-based company that focuses exclusively on transmission, said it filed its application with the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for “non-exclusive rights-of-way to develop the Southern New England OceanGrid," which it described as an “independent, open-access" offshore wind transmission system.
If approved, the company said its plan would be to link existing wind lease areas to one common transmission network and then deliver as much as 16,000 megawatts of clean power to the three southern New England states. The project's benefits, according to Anbaric, would include greater efficiency, improved reliability, and limited environmental impacts.
“As offshore wind's potential gains momentum, it's time to think big and plan rationally. It becomes clearer every day that transmission must lead the way towards greater scale, reliability, and efficiency, just as it has in Europe," Anbaric CEO Edward Krapels said. “Individual wind farm developers have gotten the industry off to a good start, but we now need a networked grid to minimize conflict and create a truly reliable offshore transmission system that will substantially de-risk wind projects."
Stephen Conant, an Anbaric partner and project manager, described the idea of independent or expandable transmission as being like a power strip when he spoke with legislators at a briefing in June.
“Imagine if we're all in here and we all want to charge our phones into one outlet. Difficult. The collective best way to do it would be to actually have a common line where you would then have everyone — just like you do at the airport — everyone plugs into a common location," Conant said. “It's as simple as that."
Conant said most of the conversation around offshore wind has focused on the power generation rather than the transmission. The 2018 Massachusetts law that authorized another 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind power and allowed the DOER to split generation and transmission was the first offshore wind law in the country that “actually mentioned transmission," he said.
“There's been a lot of discussion about offshore wind, about the generation part of things," Conant said. “But the transmission part, let's just say it's assumed it will be there."
The state Department of Energy Resources is conceptually on board with the idea of splitting the state's procurement practices to have one process to pick developers to generate the power and a separate solicitation for an independent and shared transmission line system.
In late May, the department proposed that the state stop soliciting clean energy generation and the transmission of that energy as a single package and instead suggested that it move forward in 2020 with a solicitation for the main transmission system that future generation projects would be required to tie into. Having one primary transmission system “has the potential benefit of minimizing impacts on fisheries, optimizing the transmission grid, and reducing costs," the report concluded.
But offshore wind developers have been cool to the idea of independent transmission. At a June conference in Boston, Vineyard Wind CEO Lars Thaaning Pedersen said developers would be wary of investing so much money into a project only to find out when power generation begins that the transmission feed, which would be controlled by a different entity, is unable to deliver that power to land.
“I don't see a lot of reasons for a grid that serves many projects for a number of reasons," he said. “As a developer, we put $2 or $3 billion in the water and you want to make sure the grid is there on time, on cost and on budget, and if somebody else owns it you want to make sure they have an incentive to keep it up and running at all times."
Anbaric said its proposed Southern New England OceanGrid would be built out over a period of 20 years. Its application was submitted Nov. 18 and the company asked the federal government post its application in the Federal Register for public comment by Jan. 1, 2020. The company has previously filed an application with BOEM for a separate “New York/New Jersey OceanGrid," which remains under review.

Texto completo: Two readers rebut an Op-Ed writer's defense of the president's dealings with Ukraine and breaking of norms.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Is Doing What He Was Elected to Do," by Daniel McCarthy (Op-Ed, Nov. 21):
Mr. McCarthy is right that we (or, rather, a minority of America's voters) elected Donald Trump to smash the status quo and stir up politics as usual. He misses what Mr. Trump has done since.
Mr. Trump promised to "drain the swamp" but proceeded to install various lobbyists, corporate plunderers and other vested interests in key cabinet and agency positions.
Mr. Trump railed against President Obama's relatively infrequent golf outings. Mr. Trump's golf habit is so consuming it inspired a website (TrumpGolfCount.com) and has cost taxpayers $ 110 million and counting.
Mr. Trump constantly lies, and his actions inspire a culture of falsehoods and extortion and grab-what-you-can at the highest levels of our federal government.
So Mr. McCarthy is right when he says that, for Mr. Trump, "the personal is political." The problem is Mr. Trump never switched from politics to leadership and governing. All of government, it's increasingly clear, is his personal plunder. The founding fathers put a few protections against this kind of behavior in the Constitution. I wish more Republicans in Congress saw the wisdom of that foresight.
Douglas Fischer
Bozeman, Mont.
To the Editor:
I am not sure whose 2016 campaign Daniel McCarthy is talking about, but the Trump campaign that I recall promised to bring back manufacturing, save the coal industry, replace Obamacare with a better and cheaper plan, build a wall that Mexico would pay for, solve immigration, and stock the judiciary with judges sympathetic to the religious right. Of all these promises, only the last one was enacted, in large part with the help of the Republican Senate.
The premise that President Trump would root out corruption and self-dealing by politicians and their families flies in the face of any semblance of reality, given the utter lack of transparency with respect to his own finances, which he promised to release, and that of his children and son-in-law. We truly are living in an alternate reality, when conservative proponents of Mr. Trump dismiss what our eyes and ears are so obviously telling us.

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
AXIOM at Alice Tully Hall (Nov. 23, 7:30 p.m.). Jeffrey Milarsky conducts this Juilliard new-music ensemble in a remarkable program that features Elliott Carter's "Mosaic," with Adam Phan on harp; George Lewis's "Ikons"; Morton Feldman's "Madame Press Died Last Week at Ninety"; and an arrangement of Philip Glass's "'The Hours': A Suite in Three Movements," with Jaeden Izik-Dzurko at the piano. More new music for free in the coming week includes the TAK Ensemble at Miller Theater (Tuesday, 6 p.m.) with music by Ashkan Behzadi, Erin Gee, Taylor Brook, David Bird and Tyshawn Sorey.
212-799-5000, juilliard.edu
LUCY DHEGRAE at National Sawdust (Nov. 23, 7 p.m.). Opening her four-part "The Processing Series," on the relationship between trauma and art, this vocalist and musical entrepreneur performs "More Beautiful Than Words Can Tell." The program, with works by Osnat Netzer, Bethany Younge, Jason Eckardt, Vinko Globokar, Maria Stankova and Caleb Burhans, reflects on her experience of losing her voice after a sexual assault.
646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org
MAGDALENA KOZENA at Alice Tully Hall (Nov. 26, 7:30 p.m.). Shakespeare is the inspiration behind this recital from this stylish, communicative mezzo-soprano, who is joined by a number of musicians including Mr. Kozena, better known as the conductor Simon Rattle. She sings works by Chausson, Stravinsky, Ravel, Strauss, Brahms, Janacek and Dvorak.

[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 24, 3 p.m.; Nov. 25, 8 p.m.). Gustavo Dudamel brings the one of most important orchestras in the world to Lincoln Center, though with programs that do not entirely deserve that reputation. On Monday, Ginastera's "Variaciones Concertantes" and Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" surround the New York premiere of John Adams's new piano concerto, "Must the Devil Have All the Good Tunes?" with Yuja Wang as the soloist. On Sunday, Bruckner's Symphony No. 4 is the only work on the program, just two days after it also makes up the bulk of a Carnegie Hall concert given by the Orchestre Métropolitain de Montréal (Friday, 8 p.m.), to be conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin, who recently renewed his contract there, for life.
212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
MUSICAETERNA at the Shed (Nov. 21, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 23, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 24, 3 p.m.). Depending on your tastes, the conductor Teodor Currentzis might be classical music's savior or perhaps its chief charlatan, but there is no denying the power of his performances. He and his handpicked orchestra and chorus make their North American debut in these performances of Verdi's "Requiem," accompanied here by a film commissioned from Jonas Mekas.
646-455-3494, theshed.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Nov. 21, 7:30 p.m.; Nov. 22, 11 a.m.; Nov. 23, 8 p.m.; Nov. 27, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 3). Two rounds of subscription programming at the Philharmonic begin this weekend with the young hotshot Jakub Hrusa on the podium to lead Borodin's Symphony No. 2, Dvorak's Symphony No. 6 and Saint-Saëns's Cello Concerto No. 1, with the soloist Alisa Weilerstein. Later in the coming week, Daniil Trifonov, a Philharmonic favorite, is at the keyboard for Scriabin's extraordinarily lush Piano Concerto, before Jaap van Zweden conducts Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5.

Debates Are 'Pointless Charades'
To the Editor:
Re "Democrats Soften Disagreements and Sharpen Attacks on Trump" (front page, Nov. 21):
I was relieved to learn that voters are at last putting climate change atop their list of priorities, but saving Earth means we must first vote Donald Trump firmly and finally out of office. So I was dismayed to see yet another incoherent sound-bite contest masquerading as a debate among the candidates vying to defeat him. Couldn't the Democratic National Committee or MSNBC come up with a better idea? (Rachel Maddow, I'm looking at you.)
Why not have two candidates at a time sit with a moderator for 15 or 30 minutes and freely discuss voters' top two or three concerns? If all 10 candidates were interviewed the same night, it would take no more time than the pointless charades to which we've been treated so far, and it would be a lot more useful, dignified and informative.

Respect Animals, Don't Hurt Them
To the Editor:
Re "How Not to Kill an Animal," by Margaret Renkl (Op-Ed, Nov. 19):
As we enter another season, among many, that includes among its rituals the sacrifice of an animal (or several), Ms. Renkl makes a brilliant point: Instead of debating whether we should kill animals, let's at least agree how not to do it.
While we prattle on about how much we have to be grateful for, some of us kill with cruelty for the sake of fashion, or simply out of habit.
I suggest that we put thankfulness aside this year and concentrate instead on respect. Respect for those creatures that have as much right to be here as we do, and respect for the fact that they can and do suffer, just as we do.

Texto completo: The November Democratic presidential debate had the smallest audience of the election cycle, which was half the size of the most-watched debate.
More than 6.5 million people tuned in for Wednesday night's debate on MSNBC, according to early Nielsen Media Research. The key 25-54 age demographic comprised 1.6 million of those viewers. Comparatively, October's Democratic debate, which also was one night but had twelve candidates, reached an audience of slightly more than 8.1 million viewers.
Thursday's debate, which took place the same day Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified publicly in the House impeachment investigation, had approximately half the audience of September's debate. That debate, which was aired on ABC News, had 12.9 million viewers with 3.5 million in the key demo. This debate was also broadcast on Univision, and they had 1.1 million viewers.
The debate on Thursday featured ten candidates and was moderated by Andrea Mitchell, Ashley Parker, Rachel Maddow, and Kristen Welker. The next debate is scheduled to take place on Dec. 19 at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. It is being put on by PBS NewsHour and Politico.
To date, six candidates have qualified for the next debate. They are: former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

Texto completo: Saturday, November 16, more than 420 people gathered to mingle, dine and dance at the Cleveland Public Library's "Black, White and REaD" 150th Anniversary Affair. The fundraiser, at Main Library in downtown Cleveland, celebrated the Library's sesquicentennial and raised funds to support the Cleveland Public Library Foundation (CPLF).
Hosted by the Cleveland Public Library Foundation, the Anniversary Affair showcased the Library's renowned collections as guests partied with nationally recognized authors with ties to Ohio: Raquel Eatmon who wrote Beyond Enough: How to Lead with Your Whole Self, New York Times best-selling author of The Paris Wife, Paula McLain, D.M. Pulley, best-selling author of The Dead Key, American poet Philip Metres, Dan Chaoh who wrote national bestseller III Will, and best-selling author Loung Ung whose memoir, First They Killed My Father, inspired a Netflix Original movie directed by Angelia Jolie.
Theevening's program recognized two dedicated volunteers who have made a tremendous impact on the Library: Attorney and Cleveland Public Library Board Trustee Thomas D. Corrigan and Fifth Third Bank Executive and Cleveland Public Library Foundation Board Member Robert Pincus. Guests were invited to support a newly created Transportation Fund to help schoolchildren enjoy quality-rich Library programming. Last year, more than 3,500 children participated in youth programming at our Main Library. This number represents a tiny fraction of overall students served within the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. "Given our important role as a center for learning, a cultural institution, and a neighborhood access point for critical social services, there is no better investment in the success of Cleveland than an investment in Cleveland Public Library," said Felton Thomas, Jr., Cleveland Public Library Executive Director and CEO.
Partygoers danced to the sounds of the Mike Petrone Band and other Cleveland favorites. Alex Stokes, FOX 8 reporter and granddaughter of the late Congressman Louis Stokes, also treated guests to a special performance. Driftwood Catering provided dinner and dessert for the night while guests sipped on a literary-themed cocktail called "The Bookworm." The Cleveland Public Library Foundation continues to raise vital funds for the Library's education and community programs.

Famille Hugel, 2017
Cuvee Les Amours, Pinot Blanc $14.99/$11.99
Trimbach 2017
Pinot Blanc, $15.99/$12.99
Alsace, France
13% alcohol by volume
Both of these Alsatians, in their easily recognizable, tall green bottles with yellow labels, are full-bodied, dry white wines well suited for drinking with appetizers or with the first course of a holiday feast.
And although they are both called Pinot Blanc, they are not true varietal wines but blends of family-member grapes. It’s in the blend that the wines vary slightly in their distinctive flavors of apple, apricot and pear and in their floral aromas.
I’ve liked both of these wines for some time, but I have to admit they are so similar in packaging and flavor that I often buy them indiscriminately and enjoy them with equal pleasure.
There’s no requirement in France’s Alsatian wine region that the grape named on the label be even the dominant grape used to make the wine. Pinot Blanc, a genetic mutation of Pinot Noir, is mostly grown in Alsace, Luxembourg, Germany and the mountainous areas of other nearby countries. In these two wines, Pinot Blanc plays an accompanying or minor role, sharing the blend with its progeny Auxerrois Blanc.
Trimbach, which is a blend of 75 percent Auxerrois and 25 Pinot Blanc, is slightly less acidic than the 50-50 blend of Hugel, the wines’ tasting notes say. I didn’t drink the wines side by side, but if I had, I’m not sure I could have been able to taste the differences.
These highly-rated crisp wines are produced by families who trace their winemaking heritage back almost 400 years, to the reign of Louis XIII, the Holy Roman Empire and the Thirty Years’ War with its 8 million deaths.
Alsace is a relatively small region in the east of France bordering the Rhine River and Germany. The area has had a pingpong history, bouncing over the centuries from one warring group to another. It most recently had been been claimed by Germany and since World War I, France, although Hitler took it over during World War II.
One would think after 1,000 or more years of occupation and fighting, the area would be a mess and its residents all nervously looking over their shoulders to see who’s coming over the Vosges mountains or across the Rhine. To the contrary, Alsace is a very pleasant place with a cultural blend of German and French heritage. The towns and villages are quaint with brightly colored half-timbered buildings with steep roofs and storks nesting at the peaks. It’s a quintessential picturesque yuletide sort of place where the capital, Strasbourg, annually holds one of Europe’s largest Christmas markets that attracts hordes of tourists for holiday shopping.
Famille Hugel, now with its 12th generation in charge, places the start of its winery at 1639. Trimbach one ups its competitor, claiming it began in 1626 and has had 13 generations of the family at the helm.
The wines produced by both families benefit from the Alsatian microclimate provided by the Vosges, a mountain range that blocks heavy rains from the west, keeping them from falling on the Rhine River Valley where the grapes are grown in complex limestone soils. The terroir of Alsace is excellent for growing grapes that produce crisp white wines, including dry Rieslings and Gewurtzraminers as well as Burgundy-style wines that deploy Pinot Blanc, which is best when it comes from Alsace, according to wine writer Eric Asimov in a recent New York Times article.
Trimbach and Hugel Pinot Blancs are very good, affordable wines and real bargains, particularly if you find them on sale. Both are available in most of New England, but Hugel may have to be ordered by wine merchants in some markets. If you can’t get one, the other’s just as good.
Suggestions of wines in the $10 range are always appreciated. Warren Johnston can be reached at raiseyourglassofwine@gmail.com. For past recommendations, go to raiseyourglassofwine.com.

Texto completo: Editor’s Note: This review of “I Heard You Paint Houses” originally was published Aug. 7, 2016, and is being reprinted as “The Irishman,” a movie based on the book, comes to the Cinema & Drafthouse in West Hazleton before it becomes available on Netflix next week. All eight showings - Friday through Nov. 26 - are sold out.
“I Heard You Paint Houses: Frank ‘The Irishman’ Sheeran and Closing the Case on Jimmy Hoffa” by Charles Brandt, 2004 (updated in 2005 with an epilogue and in 2016 with a conclusion by the author)
This is the third iteration of “I Heard You Paint Houses.” First was a 291-page hardcover version released in mid-2004, just six months after the death of Frank Sheeran, the longtime Teamsters union official and confidant of Jimmy Hoffa and Russell Bufalino. It was widely acclaimed by law enforcement and a front-page review in The New York Times Sunday book section sped it on its way to the best seller list.
The second was released in March 2005; the same book supplemented by an epilogue which offers further evidence of the veracity of the original version.
This third and no doubt final version is enhanced by 57 must-read pages. The final section, the Conclusion, contains thrilling “Stories That Could Not Be Told Before,” especially for those of us born and raised, as Brandt likes to say, in “Bufalino territory” (see page 311). The cover of the new edition boldly announces that it is “Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Martin Scorsese.” “Major” is probably accurate, since recent news reports characterize the film as a $100 million project with a record-setting $50 million foreign distribution deal! Move over, “Godfather.”
My only gripe is that the entire trinity lacks an index.
Sheeran was your all-too-common and typical union “muscleman,” or thug. There is no other, more polite way to describe (not judge) him. Near the end of his life he found God after participating in too many hits.
Sheeran graduated from eighth grade at Blessed Virgin Mary School and then transferred to Darby High School. At age 16 he broke his high school principal’s jaw with one angry punch and was permanently expelled. He left home shortly thereafter and joined the carnival!
He had just turned 21 when the United States got embroiled in World War II and he was off to war in Europe, where 411 unremitting, consecutive days of “take no prisoners” combat with Gen. George Patton’s forces changed him forever.
After the war he unexpectedly met Bufalino at a truck stop in New York state. Later, thanks to Bufalino, he became very close to Hoffa, the president of the powerful Teamsters union. For these two characters he would provide numerous legal and illegal services and finally land in jail. Sheeran became a powerful and feared Teamsters official in the state of Delaware.
Brandt recorded “hundreds of hours of interviews” with Sheeran and those oral statements are in prominent, large quotation marks. Brandt, however, frequently adds “critical detail and background information.”
Thus it can be said that the original version is a joint effort of both Sheeran and Brandt. Not so the 2005 epilogue and even more so the 2016 conclusion, both of which are pure Brandt in the first person.
In 1981 Sheeran hired then-attorney Brandt to defend him regarding serious labor racketeering charges but they soon parted ways over, what else, fees!
Brandt wrote:
In the hallway after the arraignment, Frank took me aside and said: “I like the way you handle yourself, and all. I got no problem with the fee. D-don’t take this wrong, but that up-front part of the money for motions and stuff like that. You don’t need to do any of that paperwork. These other lawyers in there, they’ll put all that together and you just sign your name, that’s all.” “Frank,” I said. “You’re going to have to get yourself another lawyer. I quoted you a fee in my office and you accepted it. Once an issue arises about my fee, I’m done. But what you propose is never how I work on behalf of my clients. When I prepare motions for a client, I know whose side I’m on. I have no idea whose side any of these people are on.”
Before he could answer I turned and left. (My emphasis.)
Sheeran was sentenced to 18 years on the labor racketeering charges.
In 1988 Brandt published his first book, a novel called “The Right To Remain Silent.” It was publicly praised by then President Ronald Reagan. Sheeran read it, too ... in jail! One thing leads to another.
In 1991 from prison, Sheeran again reached out to Brandt. As in 1981 Sheeran is obstinate and refuses to sign medical releases for the attorney and his partner, attorney Bart Dalton. After cooling his heels in jail, Sheeran now wants to file civil rights suits against everyone for “cruel and unusual punishment” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. (Buy your collector’s item copy now before the error is corrected in the next printing).
At the prison Brandt patiently explains to Sheeran why a petition for “medical parole” is the only way to go:
As if he hadn’t heard me and with a voice as icy cold as his glare, in a monotone through clenched teeth, he embarked on a monologue clearly written for him by a jailhouse lawyer. Every sentence began with “I want you to sue ...” When he seemed done, I said: “Frank, are you finished?” “Yeah,” he grunted. “I’m finished.”
“I wish you could hear yourself talk. Then you’d know you weren’t making any sense at all.” I had his attention. “We’re putting in for medical parole,” I continued slowly and deliberately. “And that’s all we’re doing. If we fail and if you can find a lawyer stupid enough to file these frivolous lawsuits, go right ahead. Bart will be back in a week to pick up these papers and if you want us to represent you, they’d better be signed. Guard, we’re out of here.”
Thus began, in 1991, a years-long dialogue of Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran and lawyer-turned-author, Charles Brandt, with the latter now embedded into Sheeran’s life much like an embedded war correspondent. Fellow mobsters thought the Sheeran story was going to be a mere whitewash of Sheeran’s violent lifestyle and let the project go forward. Author and subject regularly met for years with mobsters in Northeast Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and Wilmington, Delaware, and the result was the original 2004 version of “I Heard You Paint Houses.” After it was published Brandt maintained constant contact with law enforcement types, especially active and retired FBI agents. He wrote two books in the true crime genre, “Donnie Brasco, Unfinished Business” with retired FBI agent Joe Pistone, aka Donnie Brasco, and “We’re Going to Win This Thing” with retired FBI agent Lin Devecchio, and continued to hone the original story.
The Conclusion (57 pages) is especially replete with references to Northeast Pennsylvania and with tales of people who knew Bufalino. In a sense, the embed continued for 12 more years, not only with law enforcement but with Sheeran’s surviving family as well.
The Conclusion is worth the price of the book, many times, especially for people from Northeast Pennsylvania.
As for the stories that could not be told before, there area many. Of special interest is “Big Billy” D’Elia, the reputed successor to Bufalino. Of more compelling and historical interest is the alleged involvement of the mob (including Sheeran) in the killing of John F. Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
Another unfinished story that can now be told.

Local Elections May Shade 2020 Presidential Race

Texto completo: Elections always have consequences, as President Barack Obama once said, but not always the ones people expect.
For now, statewide trends seem to favor the still-unknown Democratic presidential nominee beating Republican President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania next year and reversing his shocking Keystone State win three years ago.
But G. Terry Madonna, the longtime Franklin & Marshall College political analyst and pollster, doesn’t see the trends as surefire forecasts.
“Midterms are not predictive of general elections that follow,” he said. “Ask Barack Obama.”
Republicans, aided by the tea party movement, won control of the U.S. House in 2010, only two years after Obama’s election, but Obama won re-election in 2012 anyway.
Trump’s win here hinged heavily on an almost 20-percentage-point win in Luzerne County and cutting Obama’s 27-point 2012 win in Lackawanna County to less than 4 points for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Clinton still won Lackawanna, but county Republican Chairman Lance Stange Jr. thinks the county is within Trump’s reach next year.
Nonetheless, Democrats have plenty of reasons for optimism.
For starters, Trump’s polling numbers in Pennsylvania remain mixed at best. A recent Franklin & Marshall poll showed more than half of voters with a strongly unfavorable view of him and believing he’s doing a poor job.
Voting trends seem to reflect that.
Last year, Democrats picked up 11 seats in the state House, netted five seats in the Senate and added three U.S. House members.
Two weeks ago, Democrats shockingly won control of governments in the important four counties outside Philadelphia. A third of the state’s voters live in Philadelphia and Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties, which represent only five of the state’s 67 counties.
“The Republicans do have to be concerned about what’s going on in the Philly suburbs,” Madonna said. “What went on in 2018 and again in 2019 in the municipal and county elections was a stunning victory by the Democrats.”
Democrats swept Republicans off the Delaware County Council and gained control of county government for the first time since at least the Civil War, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. They won a majority in the Chester commissioners office for the first time and control of the Bucks commissioners office. That means Democratic control of Philadelphia and all four Philadelphia suburban counties. Democrats flipped Montgomery years ago.
Almost two-thirds of southeastern voters support the impeachment inquiry into the president, according to the Franklin & Marshall poll.
“It bodes well for Democrats,” Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said.
As concerned as they are, Republicans downplay the Democrats’ southeastern Pennsylvania gains. They point out Trump lost the southeast in 2016 and still won the state by 44,000 votes.
“The Republican Party has been bleeding votes in the southeast for many years,” Republican strategist Vince Galko said. “I think the national atmosphere expedited it this time around.”
Republicans point to gains of their own in Pittsburgh’s suburban counties. They flipped control of commissioners offices in Washington, Greene and Westmoreland counties, three row offices in Cambria County and two row offices in Beaver County. They also kept control of commissioners offices in Beaver, Lawrence and Fayette counties.
“However, it’s going to come down more to who’s the president running against, what is the atmosphere at that time?” Galko said. “Is it Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or someone else? Certainly, that’s going to be a larger factor than just the outcome in southeast PA in this past election.”
In 2016, Galko said, voters went for Trump “because they were just sick of the system, sick of the status quo.”
“They may have been unsure about President Trump, but they wanted somebody to go down to D.C. and knock some tables over. They gave him the benefit of the doubt,” he said. “Will he earn that this time around again? I’m not sure, but I do think the economy is really helping him with those voters. ... We are living through the greatest economy of our lifetime right now.”
Mikus said Republican gains in suburban Pittsburgh matter less.
The southeastern counties where Democrats gained ground have three times as many voters as the southwestern counties where Republicans did.
“The southwestern counties got redder, but they weren’t by big margins,” Mikus said. “They were fairly close races. ... I take heart with that. I don’t think Republicans have much room to grow.”
A Trump victory would give Republicans back-to back wins here for the first time since 1988 when Vice President George H.W. Bush followed up President Ronald Reagan’s 1984 victory. A recent New York Times/Siena University poll had Trump trailing Biden in Pennsylvania by only 3 points, tied with Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and a point behind Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
“The real question is will the enthusiasm level of Trump’s core support, at least where you are (in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre) and out in the southwest be sufficient to get him over the finish line in 2020, and we just don’t know that yet,” Madonna said.
Too much remains unknown, he said.
“Remember, we don’t know what’s going to happen with the economy, whether it’s strong or what happens if we slide into a recession. We don’t know if there will be a foreign policy crisis of some kind. And thirdly, we have to see how all this impeachment plays out,” Madonna said. “I won’t rule out that Trump can carry our state again. I won’t rule it out.”

Trump against the professionals

Texto completo: According to Donald Trump's Republican defenders, the impeachment spectacle unfolding in Washington, D.C., is all about policy differences rather than presidential misconduct, with career foreign policy bureaucrats cooking up excuses to remove a president whose worldview they disdain.
As is so often the case with defenses of our chief executive's conduct, this argument fails completely as a defense of Trump's own behavior, while nonetheless getting at something important about the larger political moment in the West.
It fails because in the specific case under scrutiny, Trump was clearly advancing no policy agenda beyond his own self-interest. Every attempt to depict the president as somehow anxious about corruption in the unstable Ukrainian republic founders on the accumulating evidence that he was only concerned about one case, the one case that happened to involve a political rival, and that he bent U.S. policymaking specifically with that one case in mind. His policy only differed from the policy of the bureaucracy in that its execution was premised on the extraction of a favor, a politically motivated ask.
However, the president's defenders are right about this much: If you listened to the testimony from the witnesses last week, you could sense submerged beneath the critique of Trump's specific actions a larger policy worldview, one not so much argued for as simply assumed. All the people testifying believe that propping up Ukrainian democracy and supporting Kyiv's struggle against Russian irredentism is an essential goal for U.S. foreign policy. All of them believe that Trump's behavior wasn't just wrong because it turned U.S. aid to partisan ends, but also because it undermined a vital policy objective that any patriotic American ought to share.
And this is why the Ukraine scandal is likely to be remembered as a theater-of-the-absurd moment in a more serious and longer-term debate: Because it is not only Trump himself who does not share the professionals' view of America's vital interests, but a great many people, voters and politicians, Democrats and Republicans.
Moreover, it is not only the United States where there is a gap between what the foreign policy establishment believes and what the public mood supports. And it is not only populists and troublemakers who are willing to doubt the policy vision that treats the constant enlargement of American commitments, NATO and European Union membership as an inevitable and necessary goal.
One prominent doubter is Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, who resisted attempts to involve the United States in Ukraine's military defense, and who spent his presidency conducting his own internal war against what one of his aides, anticipating Trump's deep-state complaints, described as the D.C. foreign policy "blob."
Obama fought a more civilized sort of bureaucratic war than Trump, with fewer ludicrous tweets and impeachable offenses. But it was a conflict over a similar question: To what extent should Western foreign policy prioritize democracy promotion east and southeast of the European core - as opposed to pivoting to a different grand strategy that disengages from those regions for the sake of other ends?
Another doubter is the man often cast as a kind of anti-Trump, a liberal establishment's white knight - the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has lately been arguing for a limit on the European Union's expansion and a friendlier relationship with Russia, while expressing skepticism about the workability of Article Five, NATO's mutual defense trigger.
These forays have earned Macron criticism from the same establishment figures who placed so much hope in his ascent. But really they should prompt a recognition that doubts about the West's security architecture aren't just the preserve of Russian trolls and isolationists. They reflect a deep and reasonable public uncertainty about the establishment's post-Cold War autopilot, the extension of American and European commitments far past what prudence and public opinion both will bear.
Admittedly, the alternative to that autopilot is hardly clear. For Obama, it was a Russian reset that failed and a pivot to Asia that Middle Eastern troubles kept sabotaging. For Trump, it's the containment of China and Iran by some sort of league of U.S.-friendly strongmen, with self-enrichment as a side benefit. For Macron, it might be a Europe that focuses more on internal integration in preparation for the challenge of migration waves to come.
But the uncertainty around alternatives will not prevent them from emerging, on the right and left alike, even if the establishment ultimately wins its war with Donald Trump. And if Trump's manifest corruption and buffoonery has strengthened that establishment in certain ways - by persuading liberals, for instance, to subsume their skepticism of the national security state in newfound Russophobia - his political resilience is also an indicator of the limits on its influence.
The Senate Republicans who are likely to ultimately vote for Trump's acquittal are unlikely to fully defend the specifics of his conduct. But the critique of American priorities that the professionals would like to see buried by association with his misconduct - that critique will rise again.

Texto completo: The King's Kitchen realm just got a little larger.
Three years after opening, this downtown Fort Myers restaurant is expanding. King's will stay in its same location, in the former Sub & Pub space across from the Publix plaza on West First Street, but it's adding a room for private parties and a beer garden with outdoor seating. Plus, the restaurant will soon offer a full bar in addition to its current selection of beers and wines.
"It's been a good three years," chef-owner Ozzie Morrobel said.
"We've built a strong clientele with a lot of regulars — locals in the summer and snowbirds in the winter. We've been a small restaurant, and we're about to triple in size."
Morrobel said the business has benefited from the growth of downtown, and with construction under way on the new City Walk development across the street, he's optimistic about his restaurant's future.
"It's only going to get better in this area," he said.
"It's all positive."
Morrobel is originally from Puerto Rico. His family moved to Fort Myers in 1989. He was in the restaurant business for many years, decided to leave the food industry for real estate, and then went back to his cooking roots. He brings Latin flavors to many of the dishes at King's Kitchen, but he likes to emphasize that the restaurant has a wide array of offerings.
"A lot of people think we're a Latin restaurant, but we're not. We're a comfort-food restaurant," Morrobel said.
"It's comfort food from all over the world."
Though King's Kitchen has a regular menu, Morrobel and his staff are always creating new specials, usually one or two during the week and four or five on the weekends.
"People come in and they don't even open their menus, they just ask what the specials are," Morrobel said.
Some of the most-ordered dishes at King's Kitchen include the Cuban sandwich, squid-ink pasta, meatloaf, country-fried chicken and pastelon, which Morrobel said is like a Latin-style "sweet plantain lasagna."
"It's delicious and very unique," he said.
The restaurant offers catering in addition to its regular menu, and starting in December it will serve Sunday brunch.
"We're working on the menu right now," Morrobel said.
"We're going to serve the brunch classics, but we always add our own twist. We won't just do an eggs Benedict. We're going to put a King's Kitchen spin on it."
Besides its worldly comfort foods, one of the restaurant's big draws is its cozy atmosphere. Morrobel doesn't have any plans for that to change.
"It's a really cute hole-in-the-wall," he said.
"That's the way we like it. Even as we expand, we want to keep that feel."

Hearing serves as painful, hopeful reminder to veteran whistleblower

Texto completo: Pick up a newspaper or flip on the evening news, and the odds are high that you'll soon find yourself caught up in the breathless story about the identity of the "Ukraine whistleblower" who filed a complaint with the U.S. Intelligence Inspector General alleging inappropriate behavior by the president, leading to today's impeachment inquiry. So far, the person's name is a closely guarded secret.
For this mental health worker, a veteran whistleblower whose story was told a few years back in both the New York Times and Parade Magazine, the Ukraine controversy serves as a painful - but also very hopeful - reminder that "speaking the truth to power" is often a crucial step in defending our liberties and protecting the rule of law.
Back in the late 1970s, I was a youthful and idealistic Ph.D. social worker for the U.S. Public Health Service in Washington, D.C. One of my duties was to help treat and evaluate federal workers who were struggling with mental problems such as depression and PTSD.
Among my patients, I sometimes treated federal employees who told me they had experienced conflicts with their bosses - and had then been ordered to undergo forced psychiatric fitness-for-duty exams that were conducted by government and private psychiatrists.
On other occasions, I discovered that federal employees who'd been required to take the fitness exams were actually whistleblowers. After reporting waste, fraud or abuse in their government departments, they'd been punished - via the exams - for speaking out against these illegal activities.
In one especially egregious case, a secretary who'd blown the whistle on rampant overtime-padding at the Department of Transportation was required to take a forced exam conducted by an in-house psychiatrist. Without even interviewing the secretary, the psychiatrist had diagnosed her as a "paranoid schizophrenic" - a medical diagnosis that caused her to lose her job and go on disability retirement with a miserly $300-a-month benefit.
After several months of watching how federal agency heads were using these forced exams to punish whistleblowers, I decided that I could not remain silent.
For more than a year, I blew the whistle on these illegal exams, while giving numerous interviews to newspaper reporters. As a result, I wound up sitting in front of a congressional committee led by then-Maryland Democratic Congresswoman Gladys Noon Spellman, who chaired the Post Office and Civil Service Committee on Capitol Hill. On Feb. 28, 1978, I answered the committee's questions about the forced fitness exams in careful detail. What followed was a long and bitter national debate about their legality.
But the struggle paid off in the early 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan finally signed the bill that made the forced exams illegal and thus ended the practice for keeps.
These days, as I read the stories about the Ukraine whistleblower, I'm reminded all over again of how important it is to defend and support our truth-tellers, who often lose their careers as a result of reporting wrongdoing. In order to assist these valiant Americans, I established the Whistleblower Support Fund (whistleblowing.us), and I frequently try to help them by providing referrals, counseling and expert witness testimony they need to survive the ordeal of "going public" with their reports of wrongdoing in public life.
If we are to continue to enjoy the liberties we cherish as a nation, we must continue to avoid the fatal mistake of "killing the messenger" - while defending the brave whistleblowers who risk everything to keep us all safe from tyranny.
Donald R. Soeken (donsoeken@gmail .com) is the U.S. Public Health Service social worker who blew the whistle on forced fitness-for-duty psychiatric examinations of federal workers and helped to eliminate these illegal exams by testifying before the U.S. Congress.

Texto completo: A bandaged eye is now so common among people protesting inequality in Chile that it has become a rallying symbol.
SANTIAGO, Chile -- Brandon Gonzalez, 19, marched with a group of protesters down the main artery of this Andean capital on Oct. 28 when riot police barricading the way to the presidential palace opened fire with tear gas and hardened rubber bullets.
Mr. Gonzalez, who had come from his hospital job equipped with bandages and gauze to treat injured protesters, picked up a stone and hurled it at a police vehicle pumping tear gas into the crowd. Seconds later, he saw an officer about 25 feet away aim a rifle at his face.
"I felt an impact in my eye, and it all went black. I held up my hands so they would stop shooting and then laid on the ground, and they shot me three more times," said Mr. Gonzalez, who works as a hospital assistant. "I thought, they are going to kill me."
At least 285 people in Chile have suffered severe eye trauma, mostly from hardened rubber bullets and tear gas canisters fired by Chilean security forces at protesters during the month of unrest. According to the Chilean Ophthalmological Society, that count is expected to rise.
The image of a bandaged eye is now so common it has become a rallying symbol for the protesters in Chile. Even so, the likelihood of such life-altering injury has not deterred demonstrators.
The country's president, Sebastián Piñera, has struggled to quell nationwide unrest over low wages and a high cost of living, despite conceding to demands for a higher minimum wage and higher basic pension. After protesters upset over a subway fare hike burned Santiago metro stations, President Piñera declared the country "at war against a dangerous enemy" and ordered a militarized police force to patrol the streets.
Since then, the police have been blamed for at least six deaths, more than 6,300 arrests, and 2,400 hospitalizations of protesters. Public prosecutors in Chile are now investigating hundreds of cases of alleged abuses by the police, including torture and sexual violence. The damage to infrastructure and businesses is in the billions of dollars.
The Chilean government's announcement last week that it would hold a referendum in April to replace the Pinochet-era constitution -- one of the key demands of protesters -- has also not put an end to the unrest.
President Piñera has stood by the police clampdown, claiming that the use of force has been justified in order to maintain order. According to the Chilean police, nearly 1,000 officers have been hospitalized with injuries sustained during protests.
Mario Rozas, the director general of the Chilean police, announced late Tuesday that Chile would suspend the use of nonlethal pellets for crowd control and allow police to fire them only in circumstances of "extreme danger," the same standard used for live rounds.
The change came a week after a New York Times video documentary revealed that the Chilean police had blinded protesters with rubber pellets, and a few days after a university study found that the pellets contained dangerous amounts of metal.
The number of serious eye injuries at the hands of the police has outraged human rights groups and alarmed medical professionals. On Nov. 8, a 21-year-old college student named Gustavo Gatica was shot by pellets in both eyes and rendered totally blind.
For at least 12 victims, the damage to the cornea, iris and optic nerve has been so severe that doctors have had to remove the eye completely.
"A tiny ball this size that hits with such force that the eyeball just opens up like a flower," Dr. Carmen Torres said. "Such damage is very difficult to repair at all."
Dr. Torres is one of a handful of ophthalmologists at Salvador Hospital's special Eye Trauma Unit, located within tear-gas wafting range of Plaza Italia, the epicenter of the protests. Since mid-October, she and a team of doctors have received more than 211 patients with severe eye injuries resulting from nonlethal rounds. Over a third of patients have arrived with rubber, metal or ceramic fragments still lodged inside their eyes.
"If the pellet passes even near the optic nerve, it damages the ability to transmit information. And if it passes through the center of the eye, it destroys it, explodes it," Dr. Torres said. "That's why we are advocating to stop using these projectiles."
What police call a "rubber pellet" is really only partly rubber. A few days ago, at the behest of the Eye Trauma Unit, researchers at the University of Chile conducted an analysis and found that 80 percent of the pellet is composed of denser materials, including lead, that increases the projectile's velocity and makes it as hard as a skateboard wheel.
On a day in late October, the waiting room was crowded with protesters with bandages over one eye. An 18-year-old automotive mechanics student lay on a stretcher worried whether the pellet inside her closed and swollen left eye would leave her blind. A 46-year-old ironworker who was protesting the low minimum wage waited for an implant in his now empty right eye socket. A mother wiped a trickle of blood seeping from her son's new prosthetic eye as he described the moment a police officer shot him.
The officer lifted the rifle up, said her son, Jesús Emerson Llancan. "He shot me, and then he lowered it again. I spun around from the impact and he shot me again in the back here. But by the second hit, I was in shock. I was bleeding so much from my eye."
Half a dozen protesters described a similar moment of coming face to face with an officer who aimed for their heads. There's no visual evidence to back up each of their claims other than the precise location of their wounds. But videos shared over social media have shown Chilean officers pointing weapons directly at people who appear to pose no physical threat. Other videos appear to show officers shooting indiscriminately into crowds of protesters.
"It's a human rights catastrophe," said Dr. Enrique Morales, President of the Human Rights Department for the Medical College of Chile, who has been tracking eye trauma from the protests.
"If you compare the figures we see of eye injuries in France or in Kashmir or in Palestine, those numbers are much lower," Dr. Morales said, referring to wounded demonstrators in those places.
The United Nations protocol for use of what it calls "less-lethal weapons" states that rounds should be shot at the lower body, away from the head and vital organs. Chilean police protocols on use of force are comparatively vague.
Gonzalo Blumel, Chile's newly appointed Interior Minister in charge of public security, has denied allegations of human rights abuse by security forces.
"Since the first moment, the government has acted with total commitment, not just on the strict compliance of the protocols on the police and army actions. But also with total and absolute protection of fundamental human rights," he said.
It is unclear whether the policy change will have any measurable impact on the violence. Last week, President Piñera acknowledged there have been some abuses, and said they would be investigated.
"I think there have been excesses, abuses, noncompliance with the protocols, noncompliance with the rules of use of force, bad judgment or crimes," Mr. Piñera said.
When Brandon Gonzalez, the hospital assistant was shot, he said that an officer loaded him into a police van and withheld medical attention until hours later, when they deposited him at a public hospital.
"They were taunting me, saying that I will lose my sight, that I'll have one less eye," Mr. Gonzalez said.
On Wednesday, Dr. Torres operated on Mr. Gonzalez, 'and extracted from his left eye the same black rubber-metal ball she's seen in other patients. Her prognosis was grim: he will keep his eye, but because of damage to his retinal and optic nerves, he will lose all but five percent of his vision.

Texto completo: Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and Jennifer Williams testified Tuesday morning in front of the House Intelligence Committee.
WASHINGTON -- Two top national security officials offered new details about President Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine as they appeared for testimony during the second week of public hearings in House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.
At issue is whether Mr. Trump abused his power by holding out security aid and a coveted White House meeting from the Ukrainian government in exchange for an announcement from Ukraine's president of investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. Here are the new revelations from the officials, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams.
Few in the government supported holding up security aid to Ukraine, witnesses said.
Tuesday morning's witnesses provided a new window into how the national security establishment reacted to the decision to freeze $ 391 million in security aid for Ukraine for 55 days. Colonel Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council, and Ms. Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, both testified that they knew of no one at the National Security Council -- the foreign policy arm of the White House -- the State Department or the Pentagon who supported holding up the aid. "None," Colonel Vindman said.
Vindman reported concerns about Trump's call to an intelligence officer and State Department official.
Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams were the first two witnesses at a public hearing who listened in real time to Mr. Trump's now-infamous July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Both said they were alarmed; Ms. Williams called the call "unusual and inappropriate" while Colonel Vindman said it was "wrong."
But Ms. Williams said she told no one about her concerns, while Colonel Vindman offered new detail of what he did after the call: He told an intelligence officer and a State Department official before reporting his concerns to the security council's top lawyer. Together, their responses contrasted with other witnesses who have said they heard nothing wrong with the call.
The July call transcript was put on a secure server to limit access and prevent leaks.
Colonel Vindman provided new details about how the reconstructed transcript of the call ended up in a secure White House server. He testified that he believed that John A. Eisenberg, the senior lawyer at the National Security Council to whom he reported his concerns about the call, intended to put the reconstructed transcript into a secure system to limit access and prevent leaks. "I didn't take it as anything nefarious," the colonel testified. His testimony contradicts Timothy Morrison, his former direct superior at the council, who has told lawmakers that the transcript was accidentally put on the secure system.
Trump's requests for investigations were demands, Vindman said.
Colonel Vindman testified that he believed that Mr. Trump's request for Ukraine to open investigations into the "2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma" -- inquiries that could help Mr. Trump's re-election chances -- should be viewed as demands that were "inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security."
Colonel Vindman also revealed a new understanding about how he conveyed to his superiors his concerns over a White House meeting on July 10 with Ukrainian officials. He said he immediately spoke to Mr. Eisenberg, adding to a similar account from Fiona Hill, who at the time was Colonel Vindman's superior at the National Security Council.
Vindman and Williams expressed concern about Giuliani's role in Ukraine policy.
Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman added texture to the frustration inside the government about the shadow Ukraine foreign policy being conducted by the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and others. Colonel Vindman testified that he quickly became aware of "former mayor Rudy Giuliani's promoting false narratives that undermined the United States' Ukraine policy." Their testimony confirms many of the other impeachment witnesses who have described Mr. Giuliani, who has no official government job, as having an outsize role in influencing Mr. Trump's position on Ukraine.
Attacks on Vindman by the White House and Trump allies revealed a Republican strategy.
The White House and the president's Republican allies revealed a key part of their impeachment strategy as they sought to aggressively undermine Colonel Vindman's credibility. Republican lawmakers confronted Colonel Vindman with comments from Mr. Morrison questioning his judgment. The colonel, an Iraq war veteran who received a Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb, was ready for the attack, citing a work evaluation from Ms. Hill that said he was "brilliant, unflappable and exercises excellent judgment."
The White House ignored that and tweeted out the disparaging quote from Mr. Morrison, making it clear that even a decorated veteran who is still a National Security Council aide was not off limits.

In 2004, Purdue Pharma was facing a threat to sales of its blockbuster opioid painkiller OxyContin, which were approaching $2 billion a year. With abuse of the drug on the rise, prosecutors were bringing criminal charges against some doctors for prescribing massive amounts of OxyContin.
That October, an essay ran across the top of The New York Times’ health section under the headline “Doctors Behind Bars: Treating Pain is Now Risky Business.” Its author, Sally Satel, a psychiatrist, argued that law enforcement was overzealous, and that some patients needed large doses of opioids to relieve pain. She described an unnamed colleague who had run a pain service at a university medical center and had a patient who could only get out of bed by taking “staggering” levels of oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin. She also cited a study published in a medical journal showing that OxyContin is rarely the only drug found in autopsies of oxycodone-related deaths.
“When you scratch the surface of someone who is addicted to painkillers, you usually find a seasoned drug abuser with a previous habit involving pills, alcohol, heroin or cocaine,” Satel wrote. “Contrary to media portrayals, the typical OxyContin addict does not start out as a pain patient who fell unwittingly into a drug habit.”
The Times identified Satel as “a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and an unpaid advisory board member for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.” But readers weren’t told about her involvement, and the American Enterprise Institute’s, with Purdue.
Among the connections revealed by emails and documents obtained by ProPublica: Purdue donated $50,000 annually to the institute, which is commonly known as AEI, from 2003 through this year, plus contributions for special events, for a total of more than $800,000. The unnamed doctor in Satel’s article was an employee of Purdue, according to an unpublished draft of the story. The study Satel cited was funded by Purdue and written by Purdue employees and consultants. And, a month before the piece was published, Satel sent a draft to Burt Rosen, Purdue’s Washington lobbyist and vice president of federal policy and legislative affairs, asking him if it “seems imbalanced.”
On the day of publication, Jason Bertsch, AEI’s vice president of development, alerted Rosen to “Sally’s very good piece.”
“Great piece,” Rosen responded.
------------
Purdue’s hidden relationships with Satel and AEI illustrate how the company and its public relations consultants aggressively countered criticism that its prized painkiller helped cause the opioid epidemic. Since 1999, more than 200,000 people have died from overdoses related to prescription opioids. For almost two decades, and continuing as recently as a piece published last year in Slate, Satel has pushed back against restrictions on opioid prescribing in more than a dozen articles and radio and television appearances, without disclosing any connections to Purdue, according to a ProPublica review. Over the same period, Purdue was represented by Dezenhall Resources, a PR firm known for its pugnacious defense of beleaguered corporations. Purdue was paying Dezenhall this summer, and still owes it money, according to bankruptcy filings.
Purdue funded think tanks tapped by the media for expert commentary, facilitated publication of sympathetic articles in leading outlets where its role wasn’t disclosed, and deterred or challenged negative coverage, according to the documents and emails. Its efforts to influence public perception of the opioid crisis provide an inside look at how corporations blunt criticism of alleged wrongdoing. Purdue’s tactics are reminiscent of the oil and gas industry, which has been accused of promoting misleading science that downplays its impact on climate change, and of big tobacco, which sought to undermine evidence that nicotine is addictive and secondhand smoke is dangerous.
Media spinning was just one prong of Purdue’s strategy to fend off limits on opioid prescribing. It contested hundreds of lawsuits, winning dismissals or settling the cases with a provision that documents remain secret. The company paid leading doctors in the pain field to assure patients that OxyContin was safe. It also funded groups, like the American Pain Foundation, that described themselves as advocates for pain patients. Several of those groups minimized the risk of addiction and fought against efforts to curb opioid use for chronic pain patients.
Purdue’s campaign may have helped thwart more vigorous regulation of opioid prescribing, especially in the decade after the first widespread reports of OxyContin abuse and addiction began appearing in 2001. It may also have succeeded in delaying the eventual reckoning for Purdue and the billionaire Sackler family that owns the company. Although Purdue pleaded guilty in 2007 to a federal charge of understating the risk of addiction, and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and penalties, the Sacklers’ role in the opioid epidemic didn’t receive widespread coverage for another decade. As backlash against the family swelled, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September.

“Efforts to reverse the epidemic have had to counter widespread narratives that opioids are generally safe and that it is people who abuse them that are the problem,” said Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has served as a paid expert witness in litigation alleging that Purdue’s marketing of OxyContin misled doctors and the public. “These are very important narratives, and they have become the lens through which people view and understand the epidemic. They have proven to be potent means of hampering interventions to reduce the continued oversupply of opioids.”
Satel, in an email to ProPublica, said that she reached her conclusions independently. “I do not accept payment from industry for my work (articles, presentations, etc),” she wrote. “And I am open to meeting with anyone if they have a potentially interesting topic to tell me about. If I decide I am intrigued, I do my own research.”
As for Purdue’s funding of AEI, Satel said in an interview that she “had no idea” that the company was paying her employer and that she walls herself off from information regarding institute funders. “I never want to know,” she said. She didn’t disclose that the study she referred to was also funded by Purdue, she said, because “I cite peer-reviewed papers by title as they appear in the journal of publication.”
The sharing of drafts before publication with subjects of stories or other interested parties is prohibited or discouraged by many media outlets. Satel said she didn’t remember sharing the draft with Rosen and it was not her usual practice. “That’s very atypical,” she said. However, Satel shared a draft of another story with Purdue officials in 2016, according to emails she sent. In that case, Satel said, she was checking facts.
Satel said she didn’t remember why the doctor with a patient on high doses of painkillers wasn’t named in the Times story. The draft she sent to Purdue identified him as Sidney Schnoll, then the company’s executive medical director, who defended OxyContin at public meetings and in media stories. In an interview, Schnoll described Satel as an old friend and said her description of his patient was accurate. He left Purdue in 2005 and now works for a consulting company that has Purdue as a client, he said.
Purdue, in a statement, said it has held memberships in several Washington think tanks over the years. “These dues-paying memberships help the company better understand key issues affecting its business in a complex policy and regulatory environment,” it said. “Purdue has been contacted over the years by policy experts at a variety of think tanks who are seeking additional context on industry issues for their work. Our engagement has always been appropriate and aimed at providing a science-based perspective that the company felt was often overlooked in the larger policy conversation.” The company declined to discuss specific questions about internal documents and emails reviewed by ProPublica.
A spokeswoman for the Times, Danielle Rhoades Ha, said in an email that the company doesn’t know the details of how the Satel story was handled because the editors who worked on it are no longer employed there. She noted that the Times labeled the article as an “Essay” and cited Satel’s connection to AEI. Currently, she said, Times editors “generally advise reporters not to share full drafts of stories with sources in the course of fact-checking,” but there is no formal rule.
------------
Purdue launched OxyContin in 1996, and it soon became one of the most widely prescribed opioid painkillers. By 2001, it was generating both enormous profits as well as growing concern about overdoses and addiction. That August, a column in the New York Post opinion section criticized media reports that OxyContin was being abused. The piece — headlined “Heroic Dopeheads?” — mocked a “new species of ‘victim,’ the ‘hillbilly heroin’ addict.” The real victims, the article contended, were pain patients who may lose access to a “prescription wonder drug.”
At 5:17 a.m. on the day the article was published, Eric Dezenhall, the founder of Washington, D.C., crisis management firm Dezenhall Resources, sent an email to Purdue executives, according to documents filed by the Oklahoma attorney general in a lawsuit against opioid makers.
“See today’s New York Post on OxyContin,” he wrote. “The anti-story begins.”
A crisis management firm hired by Purdue praised this 2001 New York Post column. (STAT)
Purdue had hired Dezenhall Resources that summer. Dezenhall’s hard-nosed reputation fit the blame-the-victim strategy advocated by Purdue’s then-president, Richard Sackler. “We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible,” Sackler wrote in a 2001 email quoted in a complaint by the state of Massachusetts against the company. “They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.”
Purdue later followed this approach to fend off a New Jersey mother who was urging federal regulators to investigate the marketing of OxyContin. Her daughter had died while taking the drug for back pain. “We think she abused drugs,” a Purdue spokesman said without offering evidence. Purdue later apologized for the comment.
However, pain patients with legitimate prescriptions for OxyContin and similar painkillers can and do become addicted to the drugs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that “anyone who takes prescription opioids can become addicted to them,” and that “as many as one in four patients receiving long-term opioid therapy in a primary care setting struggles with opioid addiction.” A review article in The New England Journal of Medicine reported rates of “carefully diagnosed addiction” in pain patients averaged just under 8% in studies, while misuse, abuse and addiction-related aberrant behaviors ranged from 15% to 26% of pain patients.
Although Dezenhall Resources was working for Purdue until recently, it rarely has been linked publicly to the company. Purdue paid Dezenhall a total of $309,272 in July and August of this year and owes it an additional $186,575, according to bankruptcy court filings. The total amount paid to Dezenhall since 2001 was not disclosed in records reviewed by ProPublica.
Dezenhall Resources has also defended Exxon Mobil against criticisms from environmental groups and former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling as he fought against fraud charges, according to a 2006 BusinessWeek profile of Eric Dezenhall that called him “The Pitbull of Public Relations.” (Skilling was later convicted.) It reported that Dezenhall arranged a pro-Exxon demonstration on Capitol Hill to distract attention from a nearby environmental protest, and that the company discussed a plan to pay newspaper op-ed writers to question the motives of an Enron whistleblower. “We believe a winning outcome can only be achieved by directly stopping your attackers,” Dezenhall Resources states on its website.
ProPublica reviewed emails to Purdue officials in which Dezenhall and his employees took credit for dissuading a national television news program from pursuing a story about OxyContin; helping to quash a documentary project on OxyContin abuse at a major cable network; forcing multiple outlets to issue corrections related to OxyContin coverage; and gaining coverage of sympathetic pain patients on a television news program and in newspaper columns.
“Dezenhall has been instrumental in helping with the placement of pain patient advocacy stories over the last several years,” Dezenhall Executive Vice President Sheila Hershow wrote in a 2006 email.
Eric Dezenhall told ProPublica that he does not confirm or deny the identity of clients. While declining to answer questions about Purdue, or comment on the BusinessWeek article about him, he said that his company acts appropriately and seeks fair and truthful coverage.
“We regularly work with experts and journalists, including Pro Publica, to ensure accuracy in reporting and persuade and dissuade them regarding various storylines with facts and research,” he wrote. “Ultimately, these journalists and experts decide how to use the information provided.”
------------
One of Dezenhall Resources’ first moves, after being hired by Purdue, was to cultivate Satel. In July 2001, Hershow reported to Purdue officials that she and Eric Dezenhall had lunch with Satel and the doctor was “eager to get started.” Hershow said Satel had read a “debunking package” and was “interested in doing an opinion piece on the medical needs of patients being sacrificed to protect drug abusers.”
Satel said that the meeting with Dezenhall was not unusual, and that “I often talk to people who have interesting stories.”
Satel was raised in Queens and has an Ivy League pedigree. She attended Cornell University as an undergraduate before going to medical school at Brown University. She was a psychiatry professor at Yale University for several years and then moved to Washington. For a little over a decade beginning in 1997, she was a staff psychiatrist at a methadone clinic in the city.
She has become an influential voice on opioids, addiction and pain treatment. Her writings have been published in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The Atlantic, Slate, Health Affairs, Forbes, Politico and elsewhere. She frequently appears on panels, television shows and in newspaper articles as an expert on the opioid crisis and pain prescribing guidelines. “We’ve entered a new era of opiophobia,” she recently told The Washington Post.
Satel has been a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute since 2000. Among the notable figures who have spent time at AEI are the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and former Trump national security adviser John Bolton. Current fellow Scott Gottlieb returned to AEI this year after serving as commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approves and regulates prescription drugs like OxyContin.
Purdue said its annual payments of $50,000 to AEI were part of the institute’s corporate program. That program offers corporations the opportunity to “gain access to the leading scholars in the most important policy areas for executive briefings and knowledge sharing,” according to the institute’s website. Corporations can choose between three levels of donations: At $50,000 a year, Purdue was in the middle level, the “Executive Circle.” Besides the annual payments, Purdue has also paid a total of $24,000 to attend two special events hosted by the institute, according to a company spokesman.
Internal emails show the main Purdue contact with AEI was Rosen, the drugmaker’s in-house lobbyist based in Washington. In one email, Rosen described the leaders of the think tank as “very good friends” and also noted that former FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan ascended to that job after a stint at AEI as a scholar. Rosen also organized a group of pain reliever manufacturers and industry funded groups into an organization called the Pain Care Forum. It met to share information on government efforts to restrict opioid prescribing, according to records produced in litigation against Purdue.
Veronique Rodman, a spokeswoman for AEI, said the institute does not publicly discuss donors. She said that the institute does not accept research contracts, and that its researchers come to their own conclusions. “It makes sense” that Satel would be unaware of AEI funders, she said.
------------
Dezenhall’s courting of Satel soon paid off. A month after the lunch with Dezenhall and Hershow, Satel defended Purdue’s flagship drug in an article for the opinion page of The Boston Globe.
“Something must be done to keep OxyContin out of the wrong hands, but the true public health tragedy will be depriving patients who need it to survive in relative comfort day to day,” she wrote.
In February 2002, AEI held a panel discussion at its headquarters to answer the question, “Who is responsible for the abuse of OxyContin?” The panel of experts included Satel, a Purdue executive and a Purdue lawyer. Covering the event, Reuters Health reported that the panel “mostly agreed that Purdue Pharma should not be viewed as the culprit in the problem of the abuse of its long-acting painkiller OxyContin.”
Two months later, Purdue approved spending $2,000 to pay for Satel to speak to the staff of a New Orleans hospital about addiction, according to internal company records. Satel said she had “absolutely no memory of speaking at a hospital in New Orleans.” The physician who organized the planned event said he doesn’t recall if it took place, and the hospital no longer has records of medical staff talks from that period.
This article by Sally Satel ran in The Boston Globe in 2001 shortly after she met with Purdue’s public relations consultant. (STAT)
In 2003, a Dezenhall staffer recommended Satel as a guest to a producer for “The Diane Rehm Show” on NPR. The firm and Purdue executives, including Vice President David Haddox, helped prep Satel for the appearance. Haddox passed along what he called “interesting intel for Sally” that Rehm’s mother suffered from chronic headaches. “Thanks for helping us get her up to speed for the show,” Hershow replied.
A spokeswoman for WAMU, the NPR station in Washington that produced the Rehm show, said there was no policy to ask guests about funding of their organizations, or if there was a financial connection to the show’s topic. “For most segments, the producers would try to bring as many perspectives to the table as possible so that listeners would be better able to make their own informed judgment of the topic at hand,” wrote the spokeswoman, Julia Slattery.
ProPublica was unable to reach Haddox for comment.
Also that year, when conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh revealed that he was addicted to prescription painkillers, Purdue declined a request from CNN for a company representative to discuss the news on the air. Instead, Purdue recommended Satel, who assured viewers that OxyContin was a “very effective and actually safe drug, if taken as prescribed.” Dezenhall’s Hershow told Purdue executives in an email that she was “very glad Sally went on.” Hershow, a former investigative producer at ABC News, declined comment for this article.
In September 2004, Forbes magazine published a Satel article under the headline, “OxyContin doesn’t cause addiction. Its abusers are already addicts.”
“I am happy this morning!” Purdue’s then general counsel, Howard Udell, emailed other company executives and Eric Dezenhall with the subject line “RE: Forbes Article.” Three years later, Udell and two other Purdue executives would plead guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor criminal charge related to misleading patients and doctors about the addictive nature of OxyContin.
As part of that 2007 settlement, Purdue admitted to acting “with the intent to defraud or mislead” when it promoted OxyContin as less addictive and less subject to abuse than other painkillers. In an article for The Wall Street Journal headlined “Oxy Morons,” Satel defended the company. “The real public-health damage here comes from the pitched campaign conducted by zealous prosecutors and public-interest advocates to demonize the drug itself,” she wrote.
------------
After Purdue and Dezenhall launched their “anti-story,” media reports of OxyContin addiction and abuse declined for several years. In 2001, there were 1,204 stories that included the words “OxyContin,” “abuse” and “Purdue” published in media outlets archived on the Nexis database. The number plummeted to 361 in 2002 and to 150 in 2006.
Purdue’s counterattack against an ambitious investigative series about OxyContin abuse may have contributed to that drop. An October 2003 series in the Orlando Sentinel, “OxyContin Under Fire,” found that Purdue’s aggressive marketing combined with weak regulation had contributed to “a wave of death and destruction.”

UNDERLYING THE WEIRD SOUTH DAKOTA METH PSA: A WORSENING NATIONWIDE METH CRISIS: South Dakota attracted quite a bit of derision on social media Monday night with its new meth abuse-awareness ad campaign, tagline: “Meth. We’re on it.”
But as much as the public service announcement provided fodder for jokes on Twitter, it’s badly needed. Meth has, quietly, become a major nationwide crisis, as Cassidy writes in the Washington Examiner’s latest magazine issue.
But first, the background: Many couldn’t believe that the South Dakota ad campaign was real.
Screen Shot 2019-11-19 at 10.23.08 AM.png
Then, when Governor Kristi Noem tweeted it out from her official account, many critics suggested that it was tone-deaf.
But Noem insisted that the point of the ad campaign was to raise awareness, and, judging by the social media reaction, it succeeded. The state is slated to spend about $1.4 million on the campaign, created by Minneapolis marketing and ad agency Broadhead Co. It probably garnered coverage worth far more than that Tuesday night.
It’s not easy to draw attention to drug crises: Meth has made a troubling comeback since its heyday in the 1990s, and it isn’t coming from Breaking Bad-type labs in rural America. It’s more accessible than ever nationwide thanks to an increased supply from across the southern border and thus a lower cost per dose.
The rate of meth abuse increased by about 60% in the past few years, according to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. About 964,000 people said they abused meth in 2017, and 1.1 million in 2018 — almost double the number of people who reported heroin abuse (526,000). In 2017, 9,356 people died of meth overdoses, the fourth-highest toll for drugs, behind fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine (altogether, 60,566 people died from opioids that year).
For example, it took years for government officials and the broader public to pick up on the opioid crisis: Public awareness about the terrible opioid opioid crisis afflicting the nation didn’t really rise until after President Trump’s election, in 2017. Yet addiction and deaths had been rising for years in parts of the country. In 2014, then-governor Peter Shumlin dedicated his entire State of the State address to the “full-blown heroin crisis” immiserating Vermont, to little notice.
Parts of the country are now suffering badly with meth addiction: Dr. Wesley Zeger, an emergency medicine doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told the Washington Examiner the volume of meth users in the Omaha emergency room has doubled in the past two years. Similarly, Dr. Martin Huecker sees, on average, 10 methamphetamine addicts each month in his emergency room at the University of Louisville Health Sciences Center, sometimes three or four in an eight-hour shift.
Meth is cheaper than some opiates, and more readily available. People will often combine it with heroin or benzodiazepines like Xanax, a deadly cocktail. Huecker told Cassidy that the crisis is bound to escalate as long as Washington doesn’t take aggressive action to stop it early.
Hunter said that by introducing policies that address only one substance at a time, Congress is playing a never-ending game of “whack-a-mole.”
“First, we have a big crack problem, we figured out some ways around it and get it to go away, and then meth pops up, and then we squash that, and then opioids come in,” Hunter said.

TOM STEYER CALLS FOR A PUBLIC OPTION: Billionaire presidential candidate Tom Steyer on Monday proposed a healthcare system with a public option that would lead to universal coverage over time. His plan, much like Joe Biden’s and Pete Buttigieg’s, would allow Americans to buy into a Medicare-like government plan, but it would allow the government to negotiate payments and rates with insurers. It would be less of a radical overhaul than what Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for with “Medicare for all.” Negotiated rates would accommodate various levels of income, especially for those in rural areas that have seen thousands of hospital closings.
STUDY FINDS PUBLIC HEALTHCARE MAY NOT ATTRACT IMMIGRANTS: State-level Medicaid expansion isn’t necessarily a magnet for low-income immigrants, according to a new study in the Jama Pediatrics journal. Researchers found that immigrants already living in states without an expanded Medicaid plan were not more likely to move to a state that had expanded Medicaid in order to get health coverage. The authors of the study concluded there is no proof that improved public health coverage incentivizes immigrants to move to states that have adopted a more comprehensive government health plan.
‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ ISN’T POPULAR AMONG IOWA CAUCUS-GOERS: Only 36% of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers support a “Medicare for all” plan. Meanwhile, a majority, a combined total of 54%, are likely to support a public option proposal or a plan that builds off what Obamacare has already established, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions, according to a CNN/Des Moines Register poll.

Texto completo: The question posed by the article in Sunday’s Salt Lake Tribune seemed an easy one.
“Maternal anxiety is reaching ‘crazy high rates’ in Utah, and experts aren’t sure why,” was the headline on the article by Becky Jacobs, one of our excellent Report for America staffers.
Why are new mothers, and mothers-to-be, experiencing levels of anxiety ranging from high to debilitating to suicidal?
Simple. Men are pigs and Republicans are in charge. (I could go all religion on you and blame The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But having already tagged a gender and a political party, that would have been redundant.)
As I have often said in this space, the world and its economic cues have changed forever due to technology.
When making a living was a matter of upper-body strength — the only thing where men, on average, have an advantage over women — the extended family was reasonably the default choice of lifestyle. In pre-industrial, agriculture-based cultures, child (and maternal) mortality was high and you needed extra hands to till and harvest. In an industrial society, logic dictated that men go into the workplace and women stay home to raise the children. In both cases, women were pushed to have children as a way of keeping those men around, whether to bring in a paycheck or fight off saber-toothed tigers.
In the knowledge-based economy, all of that is out the window. A woman alone, or even with a child, can make her own way in the world without any smelly, lazy, demanding, sometimes violent, man cluttering up the place.
At the same time, in Utah and in much of the United States, the support system once provided by the extended family and religious organizations has not been replaced by a proper social safety net. So the idea of having children, or having as many children as previous generations had, seems financially unwise. Maybe because a woman hasn’t found, and doesn’t otherwise need, a man who is gainfully employed. Maybe because even a happily married couple has both other priorities and reasonable fears.
The United States, for example, is the only advanced nation where the term “medical bankruptcy" is a thing. Jobs are relatively plentiful but not altogether secure. The value of medical and other benefits is nowhere near keeping up with costs. Getting the college or graduate degree necessary to move to the upper echelon of careers saddles the entry-level worker with considerable debt. Suicide. Addiction. Homelessness.
And even in super-family-friendly Utah, the air is filthy and the powers that be think that universal access to health care is evil.
People — women — aren’t averse to having children because they wouldn’t love them. They aren’t having children because they know they would love them more than anything, and they are not sure that they as individuals, or the society in which they live, will be good enough for those children.
Or, in the case of all that maternal anxiety, they have those fears, but they have the children anyway.
Leave it to The New York Times to put a hole in my wonderful theory.
In a loooong piece posted on The Tribune website Monday, writer Anna Louie Sussman noted that major declines in birthrates are not unique to the U.S. Northern European nations — the essay focuses on Denmark — are seeing the same numbers despite the fact that gender equality is high, health care is a public service, college is free, parental leave is generous and childcare readily affordable.
Of course, the same things about women no longer needing men or children to be valued members of society holds there as well as here. But while the immediate economic and social status of European women is relatively secure, the planet is still a scary place.
Climate change, as Sussman said, has created a situation where, “On any given day, it seems that some part of the inhabited world is either on fire or underwater.” Income inequality is a serious destabilizer even when, for the moment, you are on the top end of the scale. And the xenophobic populists who warn of impending demographic doom are scary even when you know they are full of it, because of how many other people seem to believe them.
We need to come to terms with the fact that having fewer children is a logical decision increasingly made by free people. The culture and the government need not to stand athwart, but adapt. If we need more workers, accept more migrants and refugees. If Social Security and Medicare need more money, raise taxes on the rich.
And if we really want families to have more children, free them from medical and student debt, improve schools and the environment and make having children something that reasonable people might want to do.

Thomas L. Friedman: Mike Pompeo is last in his class at West Point in integrity

Texto completo: It seems like every story you read about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo always includes the sentence that he graduated “first in his class” from West Point. That is not a small achievement. But it is even more impressive in Pompeo’s case when you consider that he finished No. 1 even though he must have flunked all his courses on ethics and leadership. I guess he was really good in math.
I say that because Pompeo has just violated one of the cardinal rules of American military ethics and command: You look out for your soldiers, you don’t leave your wounded on the battlefield and you certainly don’t stand mute when you know a junior officer is being railroaded by a more senior commander, if not outright shot in her back.
The classes on ethics and leadership at West Point would have taught all of that. I can only assume Pompeo failed or skipped them all when you observe his cowardly, slimy behavior as the leader of the State Department. I would never, ever, ever want to be in a trench with that man. Attention all U.S. diplomats: Watch your own backs, because Pompeo won’t be.
Pompeo knows very well that his ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was an outstanding foreign service officer, whose tour of duty in Kyiv had been extended by his own State Department in March 2019 until 2020 — because of the excellence of her work. But, alas, she was suddenly told to get on the next plane out in late April, after President Donald Trump — having marinated himself in conspiracy theories about Ukraine showered on him by Rudy Giuliani and his corrupt Ukrainian allies — demanded she be yanked.
As Yovanovitch put it to the House Intelligence Committee on Friday: “Individuals, who apparently felt stymied by our efforts to promote stated U.S. policy against corruption — that is, to do the mission — were able to successfully conduct a campaign of disinformation against a sitting ambassador, using unofficial back channels. As various witnesses have recounted, they shared baseless allegations with the president and convinced him to remove his ambassador, despite the fact that the State Department fully understood that the allegations were false and the sources highly suspect.’’
Yes, Pompeo knew 100% that it was all a setup. We know that because, when Sen. Bob Menendez asked Pompeo’s deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, about Yovanovitch — at Sullivan’s Senate confirmation hearing Oct. 30 to become the next U.S. ambassador to Moscow — he stated that she had served “admirably and capably.” When Menendez asked Sullivan whether Giuliani was behind her removal, Sullivan baldly declared that Giuliani was “seeking to smear Ambassador Yovanovitch, or have her removed. I believed he was, yes.”
Those were the words of Pompeo’s own deputy!
But they’ve never come out of Pompeo’s mouth. Though he reportedly argued privately to the president to keep Yovanovitch in place, Pompeo faithfully executed Trump’s order without uttering a word to defend his ambassador’s reputation in public.
Pompeo instead let his ambassador to Ukraine — who depended on him for protection — be stabbed in her back with a Twitter knife, wielded by the president, rather than tell Trump: “Sorry, Mr. President, if you fire her, I will resign. Because to do otherwise would be unjust and against my values and character — and because I would lose the loyalty of all my diplomats if I silently went along with such a travesty of justice against a distinguished 33-year veteran of the foreign service.”
Trump, the cowardly bully that he is, probably would have backed down had Pompeo showed some spine. But Pompeo did not attempt that, because he wants to run for president after Trump — and did not want to risk alienating Trump. It is as simple as that, folks.
Or it’s as simple as this: “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, but lose his soul?” — Mark 8:36.
I have only met Pompeo once. I found him in private smart and engaging — but then we didn’t discuss ethics. So many in the State Department have now lost all respect for him — with good reason. His behavior is one of the most shameful things I have seen in 40 years of covering U.S. diplomacy.
How can Pompeo think he’s got what it takes to make the hard decisions needed to lead a nation as president, and send soldiers to war, when he can’t make a clear-cut easy decision to protect one of his own diplomats from being smeared by people acting outside our system.
As two now retired, longtime State Department diplomats, Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky, wrote on CNN.com on Saturday, “At the very least, Pompeo enabled the smear campaign to go unchallenged, acquiesced in the Giuliani back-channel effort with Ukraine and failed to say a word in defense of Bill Taylor, George Kent or Marie Yovanovitch. These are breathtaking acts of craven political cowardice and beneath the dignity of any secretary of state.”
Mike Pompeo: Last in his class at West Point on ethics in leadership.
I get the fact that Rep. Devin Nunes and Sen. Lindsey Graham have a contest going over who can debase themselves in public the most by defending indefensible actions by Trump. (It’s neck and neck.) But they’re GOP politicians, people we now know who will do anything to avoid giving up their $174,000-a-year salaries and free parking at National Airport.
But Pompeo is the secretary of state. That is such a privilege and responsibility. Thomas Jefferson was the first person to hold that job. Pompeo is no Jefferson. All he is doing now is trying to hide as much as possible from public view, counting on the next Trump outrage to wash away his own outrageous behavior. But the mark of Cain on his forehead will not wash off. He didn’t even have the decency or courage to speak to Yovanovitch personally, to look her in the eye and at least say, “Hey, I’m sorry.’’
Reporters and columnists need to ask Pompeo every chance they get: “What moral code are you operating by that would justify such behavior?’’
I wanted to make sure that I was not being unfair to the secretary of state, so I Googled the phrase “Pompeo Defends Yovanovitch” — just to make sure that I hadn’t missed anything. These were the headlines that came up: “Pompeo Is A ‘Coward’ For Not Defending Marie Yovanovitch,” “Pompeo Doesn’t Address Concerns Raised by Yovanovitch,” “Pompeo ducks questions about State’s lack of support for Yovanovitch” and “Senior State Adviser: Pompeo’s Silence on Yovanovitch Attacks Absolutely Killed Morale.”
So it’s now clear that Pompeo had not taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution. He took an oath to defend and protect Donald Trump and Pompeo’s own future political career — above all else — and that’s exactly what he’s been doing. Shame on him.
As for Yovanovitch, thank you for your service. You are a credit to our nation and its ideals — everything your boss was not. Hold your head high. Jefferson would have been proud of you.

Texto completo: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the police and protesters should refrain from violence. Senator Mitch McConnell said President Trump should make forceful statements on Hong Kong.
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday called for all sides to exercise restraint in the escalating Hong Kong conflict, and said the territory's government should start an independent investigation into incidents during the half-year of pro-democracy protests. That inquiry presumably would include reviewing accusations of police misconduct.
"The United States is gravely concerned by the deepening political unrest and violence in Hong Kong, including the standoffs between protesters and police at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and other campuses," Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference in Washington. "We have repeatedly called for restraint from all parties in Hong Kong."
"The Hong Kong government bears primary responsibility," he said, adding that the conflict could not be resolved by law enforcement alone.
He called for the government to "take clear steps to address public concerns," and stressed that Carrie Lam, the territory's chief executive, should "promote accountability" by putting in place an independent investigation.
Mr. Pompeo's remarks were the strongest so far by a senior Trump administration official during an escalation in violence in Hong Kong that began on Nov. 11, when protesters tried to disrupt traffic across the city on a workday but were met by an aggressive police presence.
A traffic policeman shot a young unarmed protester, and activists set on a fire a man who had confronted them. The police also breached university campuses, considered a last refuge of the activists', which ignited battles at the schools. Early Tuesday in Hong Kong, the police were still trying to arrest hundreds of protesters who had occupied Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
Protesters have been calling for months for an independent inquiry into what they call abuses against activists and bystanders by police officers. As tensions have grown, the police have increasingly used tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water cannons loaded with chemicals that cause intense pain on contact with skin. The police have deployed all of those in its siege of Polytechnic University, which began Saturday night.
At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Pompeo said that "the Chinese Communist Party must honor its promises to the Hong Kong people," as enshrined in an agreement that London and Beijing made before Britain handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997. The agreement says China will allow Hong Kong to maintain a semiautonomous political and legal system for 50 years from the handover, under a governance model commonly called "one country, two systems."
On the Senate floor on Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said leaders in Beijing and Hong Kong must "de-escalate." He added he was working to try to bring the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act to a floor vote.
The bill, which passed the House by unanimous consent, would mandate the executive branch to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who carry out human rights abuses and review annually the favorable trade status that Washington grants Hong Kong. Mr. McConnell has been criticized for delaying a floor vote on the bill.
He said Monday that the administration already had "significant tools" it could use to support Hong Kong protesters, and urged President Trump to be more vocal on Hong Kong.
"I would encourage this president, who has seen Chinese behavior for what it is, with clarity that others have lacked, not to shy away from speaking out on Hong Kong himself," Mr. McConnell said. "The world should hear from him directly that the United States stands with these brave men and women."
Mr. Trump rarely talks about human rights, and he has not consistently made strong remarks on Hong Kong. In June, he told China's leader, President Xi Jinping, that he would refrain from speaking publicly on Hong Kong as long as negotiations to settle a trade war between Washington and Beijing were progressing. His most forceful remarks on Hong Kong were in a speech in September in front of the United Nations General Assembly; he spoke of the conflict in the territory while praising the authoritarian Mr. Xi.
Mr. McConnell on Monday also spoke of the threat to Muslim ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang region of northwest China by pointing to a New York Times report published on Saturday of 403 pages of leaked Communist Party documents on the system of internment camps there. The camps have been used to hold at least one million Muslims, and the documents show Mr. Xi set the policy starting in 2014.
Mr. McConnell said the documents were "a handbook for this Orwellian campaign to effectively erase a religious and ethnic minority in a region that is supposed to be legally distinct from the rest of China." He added that the campaign was "chilling" and "systematic."
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter that the leaked documents showed "top officials in the Chinese Communist Party directed a brutal & repressive campaign against the Uighurs and religious minorities."
Because of the trade talks, Mr. Trump has held back from a policy to impose sanctions on Chinese officials for the Xinjiang abuses.

Texto completo: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)-is kicking-his war on TikTok up a notch: He's-unveiling a new bill designed to-protect Americans' communications from going to China.
The National Security and Personal Data Protection Act-would bar companies from China, Russia or other countries that present-national security concerns from transferring Americans' data back within their borders " where it could be used to spy on-the United States.-It would also prevent them from collecting data that isn't necessary to the operation of their business,-such as phone contacts or location in the case of TikTok, the viral video app owned by China's ByteDance.-
'It shouldn't be that you can't have fun on an app anymore without it collecting your entire personal profile and shipping it off to a hostile nation-state, who will do who knows what with it,' Hawley said in an interview with The Technology 202. 'And of course, they will amass more and more of this information over time.'
Hawley's legislation underscores the growing national security concerns in Washington surrounding the tech industry's ties to Beijing amid a broader trade war. But it would also-create new barriers for tech companies that try to operate in both countries " potentially contributing to a further divide in the tech services available in the United States and China.-
American companies, including Apple, would also-be prohibited from storing data in China and certain other countries that present national security concerns.
Those-restrictions could make it difficult for American companies to comply with local laws and limit their ability to operate in the country.
The senator acknowledged that U.S. companies would probably need to change their strategies.-'It would certainly prevent them from doing business on Beijing's terms,' said Hawley, who-gave both TikTok and Apple the empty-chair treatment at a Capitol Hill hearing earlier this month, blasting the companies for not accepting his invitation to publicly testify about their relationships with the Chinese government.
TikTok has been on the defensive as federal officials take a closer look at its data security practices and reports-that it engages in censorship at the behest of the Chinese government. The company is-at the center of an investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has the power to place severe limitations on the business or even unwind ByteDance's acquisition of Musical.ly, which was later rebranded as TikTok. The 2017 deal largely sailed through with little regulatory scrutiny until more recently, when TikTok surged in popularity among American teens. Hawley's bill would also require CFIUS to block such mergers unless the companies obtain preapproval.
TikTok has said it stores American users' data in the United States and, in some instances, Singapore. TikTok chief executive Alex Zhu told the New York Times on Monday that-TikTok user data was separated from the rest of ByteDance, and was not even used to support ByteDance's artificial intelligence and other technologies. 'The data of TikTok is only being used by TikTok for TikTok users,' he said.
Hawley's legislation would require that the company annually certify to the Federal Trade Commission that it's not transferring Americans' data to China and otherwise complying with the law.
'In those countries where the risks are high, I think we have got to err on the side of protecting American consumers' privacy and by extension, protecting our own national security,'-Hawley said.
American tech companies will probably fight some of the restrictions Hawley is proposing because complying with them could make it impossible to offer certain products and services in China. Apple for instance has said that to offer its iCloud services in the country, it is required to store-Chinese customers' data and sensitive encryption keys locally in compliance with Chinese law, raising concerns among legal experts that Beijing could use it to carry out human rights abuses. Any change to that practice could cut the company off from over 1 billion potential customers in a country where tech adoption is rapidly rising.
But Hawley said he thinks American tech titans will fare just fine under his proposed bill. 'I suspect that [Apple] will find ways to do business, perhaps even to access the Chinese market through other means,' he said.

Texto completo: A strange reversal is taking place across the world.
America " or at least, America's president " is no longer trying to make the world safe for democracy. But dictators are working hard to make the world safe for dictatorship.
The United States is retreating, almost apologizing for ever having thought about promoting democracy. Everyone from Rand Paul to Bernie Sanders and many in between agrees we should stay home and mind our business.
But the result is not a world in which every country is free to go its own way.
Instead, the world's tyrants " while still complaining about color revolutions and U.S. interference " roam far and wide, promoting their ideologies and their corporations, bullying and buying and burrowing and shooting their way to influence.
Russia and China, the loudest conjurers of imaginary CIA pro-democracy plots, have become the world's most active underminers of democracy beyond their borders.
Russia clandestinely stokes racism and xenophobia in Sweden, as the New York Times reported. Far less covertly, as the Times also reported, Russians bribe candidates, stack rallies and buy TV ads to sway and undermine an election in the African island nation of Madagascar.
Sometimes the regimes deploy troops, as Russian President Vladi mir Putin has done to keep Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in power.
Sometimes they deploy corporations. When Ugandan strongman Yoweri Museveni feared a challenge from a suddenly popular opposition politician, his intelligence agency turned to China's flagship communications company Huawei to help penetrate the dissident's encrypted messages, as the Wall Street Journal recounted in August.
Other nations follow the lead of the big two. Dictators in Saudi Arabia and Egypt have sought to squelch democracy and bolster dictators in Sudan and elsewhere across the Middle East.
Sometimes the motivation is so mercenary that even United Fruit Co. at its heyday might have blushed. China's Belt and Road Initiative aims to lock up natural resources and impose big infrastructure contracts on one-sided terms. Russia's Madagascar dirty tricks were aimed at maintaining a stake in a local company that mines chromium.
But the world's dictators also act to save themselves at home.
Not so long ago, democracy was ascendant, and the dictators felt threatened. One by one, past lies about democracy being a 'Western' value were shattered: It turned out that Asians, Slavs, Arabs " indeed, all human beings " want to live in the dignity of self-rule.
The dictators responded first with desperate brutality against their compatriots " gunning down students in Tiananmen Square, murdering opponents in the shadow of the Kremlin, luring a freethinking journalist to be dismembered in a Saudi consulate.
But they realized that freedom beyond their borders could be a threat, too. Putin invaded and still occupies much of Ukraine, because a thriving democracy on his border gives his own people dangerous ideas. China bullies and threatens Taiwan, because self-governing Chinese citizens there put the lie to Communist propaganda at home.
Democratic governments also can use international pressure and institutions to press authoritarian regimes to honor universal human rights, emboldening and encouraging the citizens of unfree nations. By contrast, put Venezuela on the U.N. Human Rights Council, and you can be sure no autocrat anywhere will be made to feel uncomfortable. The more Venezuelas there are, the better Xi Jinping can relax.
Just look at China embracing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman not long after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi " and the crown prince, supposed defender of the Muslim faith, in return actually praising China for its brutal repression of Uighur Muslims in western China.
Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton or George W. Bush would be speaking up against this authoritarian aggression and for the right of all human beings to live in freedom.
Today we have a president who prefers the company of strongmen " whether Turkish or Saudi, Russian or North Korean " to that of democratic allies. His presidency is both a consequence of Russian activism " Putin worked hard for Donald Trump's election, after all " and its enabler.
We don't know yet whether Trump will prove a historical aberration. His isolationism obviously resonates, and it amplifies a retrenchment that began, far more modestly, in the Barack Obama years. On the other hand, Congress continues in a bipartisan way to back the National Endowment for Democracy " which, in contrast to Russia and China, supports democracy overseas transparently, and without favoring any particular party or outcome.
More heartening: Even the dictators' onslaught and American reticence cannot stop people from rising up and demanding their rights. Algerians, Lebanese, Armenians, Tunisians, Sudanese, Bolivians, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Hong Kongers, Ethiopians, Malaysians " these people all deserve more support than they are getting.
But they are not waiting for support, nor letting themselves be intimidated by the new imperialists of authoritarianism.

The conformity of 'wokeness'

Texto completo: Former President Barack Obama drew quite a crowd recently at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago. That’s not news. But his pointed observation of the Left’s "woke" culture is worthy of headlines. Being "woke" seems to mean that your eyes are wide open to everyone else’s political sins. Essentially, "woke" on the Left has become conformity to a political dogma, and may God help you if you are still asleep.
As Obama put it: "This idea of purity and you’re never compromised, and you’re always politically 'woke' and all that stuff, you should get over that quickly. The world is messy; there are ambiguities."
Even more pointedly: "Like if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn’t do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself because: ‘Man, did you see how woke I was? I called you out.’"
Corpus analysis indicates that "wake up" and "awake" often involve some kind of self-awareness, not the judgment of others. Obama was asking his audience to do something more along those lines — introspection, questioning the commonly accepted way of doing things.
There has been virtually no media coverage on Obama’s earlier comments in the same gathering: "… so the first stage is just kind of figuring out, all right, what do you really believe? What’s really important to you? Not what you pretend is important to you, but what is really important to you, and what are you willing to risk or sacrifice for it?"
In this sense, Kanye West seems to be truly "woke." In a recent interview on BigBoy TV, West said, “My father was a Black Panther, my mother got arrested for the sit-ins at age six. They were fighting for us to have the right to our opinion, not the right to vote for whoever the white liberals said black people are supposed to vote for.” He went on, “Everybody think they so woke, but they following the rules of what woke supposed to be.”
West is putting the word back into some of its original context. The first recorded use of "woke" in a political sense was back in 1962. It appeared in The New York Times Magazine glossary of Harlem phrases and words. This was alongside an article by black novelist William Melvin Kelley on African American slang. Then, in 1972, a character in Barry Beckham’s play Garvey Lives! proclaimed that he’ll “stay woke” with the writings of Jamaican activist Marcus Garvey. For many years, the term stayed in the African American community and was used there almost exclusively.
Of course, many on the Left have mocked and shunned West merely because he is now a vocal supporter of President Trump. West has been "canceled," another term that is now in vogue. He joins the ranks of many others, such as journalist Katie Herzog, who published a piece on transgender people who experience second thoughts and stop their sexual transitions.
Let’s be clear. Free societies need people to be "woke" — that is, to think out of the box, to find themselves, to question established paths and directions. This makes for healthy and innovative communities. But people and facts cannot be canceled. Safe spaces and puritanical shaming do not constitute a democracy, nor do they win elections in the long run.

Texto completo: Washington • When he was running in 2016, Donald Trump told me that he reminded himself of another presidential candidate — someone, Trump said, who was also tremendously good-looking, a former entertainer and a Democrat-turned-Republican.
The vainglorious Trump felt he was the second coming of Ronald Reagan.
It is true that, like Reagan, Trump has reshaped his party in his own image, fully inhabiting it. But Reagan’s great mission was to thwart the Evil Empire, taunting that he would put a Star Wars shield in the sky. He wanted democratic ideals to supersede authoritarian rule in the Soviet Union.
Trump’s more sinister and incomprehensible aim is to help the Russians whenever he can.
While Reagan’s legacy will be helping to tear down communism and that wall, Trump’s legacy will be turning Republican lawmakers into dupes assisting Russia as it undermines our democracy — and democracy around the world.
Privately, many Republicans say that they do not buy into all of Trump’s deeply disturbing, topsy-turvy policies toward authoritarian regimes. Trump began echoing the Kremlin talking points during his campaign, saying about Vladimir Putin’s Crimea annexation: “The people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.”
But GOP pols go along publicly because they are recreants, slavishly trying to hold onto voters who are more intensely aligned with Trump than old-style Republicans.
Republicans may be winning the impeachment battle on Fox News, but they are getting clobbered by the classy diplomats demonstrating true patriotism in the hearing room. Republican members of the Intelligence Committee risibly struggle to back up Trump on his demented conspiracy theory — belied by the consensus of the entire U.S. intelligence community — that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election to help Hillary, rather than Putin who meddled to help Trump.
Nancy Pelosi never spoke truer words than when she chided Trump, “With you, all roads lead to Putin.”
Reagan would be stunned to find Republican members of the House at war with the FBI and the CIA — all to bolster Trump’s tender ego. Their preference seems to be to allow Russian meddling again if that’s what’s necessary for Trump to prevail a year from now.
Despite Republican efforts to throw up a smokescreen, despite their complaints that they are being muzzled even as they pose questions, it is clear that the president was putting his own political interests — looking for dirt on Hillary and the Bidens — above national security and using shady henchmen to do it.
It’s laughable that Donald Trump was concerned about corruption in Ukraine. Rather, the most corrupt president ever was determined to export his own corruption to Ukraine.
The longtime civil servants made clear that history in Ukraine is still being written, that soldiers are dying in the “hot war” between Russian and Ukraine and that subjugating U.S. policy to Trump’s petty, paranoid actions may yet deprive us of a valuable ally.
Alluding to Rudy Giuliani and his indicted cronies, former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch said: “Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old corrupt rules sought to remove me. What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a U.S. ambassador. How could our system fail like this? How is it that foreign, corrupt interests could manipulate our government?”
Because Republicans are now dupes to dictators and sleazy foreign businessmen.
Republicans tried to minimize the former ambassador’s ordeal at the hands of her bosses, suggesting it was a matter for HR and noting that she now has a sweet gig at Georgetown University. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley sarcastically riposted that Yovanovitch getting ousted at the pinnacle of her career no doubt felt “like a Hallmark movie.”
Trump told Ukrainian President Zelenskiy that “the woman was bad news” and added ominously that “she’s going to go through some things.” In another call, Trump introduced his favorite subjects — beauty pageants and Eastern European beauties — telling Zelenskiy: “When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine was always very well represented.”
In an aria of oblivious self-destruction, the president further intimidated Yovanovitch just at the very moment that she was testifying about how she had felt intimidated by the president.
“Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,” he tweeted, seemingly blaming her for Black Hawk Down. “She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.”
In testimony Friday afternoon, another State Department aide said that he, too, overheard Trump on a call with Ambassador Gordon Sondland of the European Union pressing for investigations and that Trump was reassured by his man in Kyiv that Zelenskiy “loves your ass” and would do what it takes. Oh, high-level diplomacy.
Democrats know Moscow Mitch will squelch them in the end, but hope they’ll get through to enough independents and suburban Republicans to deny Trump a second term.
No matter how many decent Americans come forward to expose his sordid behavior, will Trump be hauled out of the White House kicking and screaming while a celebratory Baby Trump balloon flies overhead?
The answer to that: Nyet.

Ross Douthat: Real disagreements over foreign policy are buried in Trump’s misconduct

Texto completo: According to Donald Trump’s Republican defenders, the impeachment spectacle unfolding in Washington, D.C., is all about policy differences rather than presidential misconduct, with career foreign policy bureaucrats cooking up excuses to remove a president whose worldview they disdain.
As is so often the case with defenses of our chief executive’s conduct, this argument fails completely as a defense of Trump’s own behavior, while nonetheless getting at something important about the larger political moment in the West.
It fails because in the specific case under scrutiny, Trump was clearly advancing no policy agenda beyond his own self-interest. Every attempt to depict the president as somehow anxious about corruption in the unstable Ukrainian republic founders on the accumulating evidence that he was only concerned about one case, the one case that happened to involve a political rival, and that he bent U.S. policymaking specifically with that one case in mind. His policy only differed from the policy of the bureaucracy in that its execution was premised on the extraction of a favor, a politically motivated ask.
However, the president’s defenders are right about this much: If you listened to the testimony from the witnesses this past week, you could sense submerged beneath the critique of Trump’s specific actions a larger policy worldview, one not so much argued for as simply assumed. All the people testifying believe that propping up Ukrainian democracy and supporting Kyiv’s struggle against Russian irredentism is an essential goal for U.S. foreign policy. All of them believe that Trump’s behavior wasn’t just wrong because it turned U.S. aid to partisan ends, but also because it undermined a vital policy objective that any patriotic American ought to share.
And this is why the Ukraine scandal is likely to be remembered as a theater-of-the-absurd moment in a more serious and longer-term debate: Because it is not only Trump himself who does not share the professionals’ view of America’s vital interests, but a great many people, voters and politicians, Democrats and Republicans.
Moreover, it is not only the United States where there is a gap between what the foreign policy establishment believes and what the public mood supports. And it is not only populists and troublemakers who are willing to doubt the policy vision that treats the constant enlargement of American commitments, NATO and European Union membership as an inevitable and necessary goal.
One prominent doubter is Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, who resisted attempts to involve the United States in Ukraine’s military defense, and who spent his presidency conducting his own internal war against what one of his aides, anticipating Trump’s deep-state complaints, described as the D.C. foreign policy “blob.”
Obama fought a more civilized sort of bureaucratic war than Trump, with fewer ludicrous tweets and impeachable offenses. But it was a conflict over a similar question: To what extent should Western foreign policy prioritize democracy promotion east and southeast of the European core — as opposed to pivoting to a different grand strategy that disengages from those regions for the sake of other ends?
Another doubter is the man often cast as a kind of anti-Trump, a liberal establishment’s white knight — the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has lately been arguing for a limit on the European Union’s expansion and a friendlier relationship with Russia, while expressing skepticism about the workability of Article Five, NATO’s mutual defense trigger.
These forays have earned Macron criticism from the same establishment figures who placed so much hope in his ascent. But really they should prompt a recognition that doubts about the West’s security architecture aren’t just the preserve of Russian trolls and isolationists. They reflect a deep and reasonable public uncertainty about the establishment’s post-Cold War autopilot, the extension of American and European commitments far past what prudence and public opinion both will bear.
Admittedly, the alternative to that autopilot is hardly clear. For Obama, it was a Russian reset that failed and a pivot to Asia that Middle Eastern troubles kept sabotaging. For Trump, it’s the containment of China and Iran by some sort of league of U.S.-friendly strongmen, with self-enrichment as a side benefit. For Macron, it might be a Europe that focuses more on internal integration in preparation for the challenge of migration waves to come.
But the uncertainty around alternatives will not prevent them from emerging, on the right and left alike, even if the establishment ultimately wins its war with Donald Trump. And if Trump’s manifest corruption and buffoonery has strengthened that establishment in certain ways — by persuading liberals, for instance, to subsume their skepticism of the national security state in newfound Russophobia — his political resilience is also an indicator of the limits on its influence.
The Senate Republicans who are likely to ultimately vote for Trump’s acquittal are unlikely to fully defend the specifics of his conduct. But the critique of American priorities that the professionals would like to see buried by association with his misconduct — that critique will rise again.

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of "The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time," said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to overdose, is trying to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.
The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer."
Question: How do you know if you are an empath?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else's pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don't have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people's stress if they don't learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques ... Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath's Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people's stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have special challenges and also gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person's position, even if we don't particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much?
Orloff: Yes, I've seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world's non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U.S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.

Texto completo: Invite a Spanish-speaking friend to join you for a meal at Portland's Quiero CafÃ©, and the two of you might inadvertently kick off a beverage-themed Who's On First skit.
"Quiero CafÃ©," you suggest, not realizing that phrase can also be interpreted as "I'd like coffee."
"OK," your friend answers. "But where do you want to go?"
"Queiro CafÃ©."
And...scene.
Co-owner Alejandra Herrera is well aware of the name's multiple meanings and their potential for wordplay. "People sometimes already know the words mean 'I want coffee,' but it's also about love. We always say that when you start dating someone, you say te quiero. When you're more into it, you say te amo," she said. "It's like a lower level of love, but it's still love."
Herrera and her business partner, co-owner Carlos Guzman have clearly put a lot of love into the casual, counter-service restaurant they opened in the former Trattoria Fanny space this May. The interior is brooding and tropical - charcoal-gray walls and dark-stained woods set off by steel chairs and barstools in two shades of green and a vivid, wall-length mural of oversized philodendron leaves. It feels like the dining room in the eye of a hurricane.
Yet staff are upbeat and eager to walk diners through the extensive menu of more than 30 beverages and three dozen pan-Latin dishes. "It's a lot to take in, but it's all good," empathized a server on my second visit. Then, perhaps sizing me up for someone who can't handle his chilies, offered: "Don't worry, it's not spicy except for the chicken empanada ($3.75)." The contrarian in me insisted on trying one. It turns out the smoky, chipotle-braised, pulled chicken breast filling would barely register on the Scoville scale.
Indeed, you might get a surprise if you come expecting the prickling, peppery heat of some Mexican dishes. South American cooking is not necessarily spicy, especially dishes that evoke Herrera's Chilean or Guzman's Colombian heritage.
"In Portland and Saco (at the other branch of Quiero CafÃ©), we just wanted to show people that Latin food is more than just tacos and quesadillas - it's more than Mexican food. We want to do food from many regions and give people a real taste of Latino America," Hererra said.
Central to this mission are baked, Chilean-style empanadas (all $3.75 apiece): compact hand pies with crimped, cracker-like crusts. To help diners differentiate among identical-looking empanadas, the kitchen artfully stencils each with edible ink to identify the type of filling inside.
Among Quiero CafÃ©s best Chilean empanadas are the Tomate, a calzone-esque blend of mozzarella cheese, chopped fresh tomato, basil and spinach; its fraternal twin, the ChampiÃ±on, which substitutes diced button mushrooms for tomato; and the superior Puerco, stuffed to bursting with shreds of laurel-and-orange-spiced pulled pork butt and a caramelized sweet plantain.
However, wet fillings create what Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood might provocatively term "soggy bottom problems" for several of the empanadas, most especially the Vegetales. Others, like the too-sweet, pineapple-and-ham PiÃ±a, or the flavorless yellow-rice-and-black-bean starch bomb Frijol, are imbalanced and forgettable.
Sadly, the dense, overbaked flan ($3.50) is equally humdrum, as is a side order of desiccated sweet plantains ($6.50).
This is not to say that Quiero CafÃ© doesn't know what to do with plantains. In the chicken Patacon ($13), one of the restaurant's half-dozen large-format "Big Bites," the kitchen squashes rounds of unripe green plantain together into a single flat disc and griddles it to a crunchy, toast-like consistency, then piles it, tostada-style, with slow-cooked chicken breast, avocado and lashings of aioli and pink, ketchup-tinted mayo.
"That's one I like with the black habaÃ±ero hot sauce you'll find on the table," the counter staffer told me. I took her recommendation and cautiously dabbed a few dashes of the tarry-looking El Yucateco salsa on my Patacon, then, discovering that the dark potion added more smoke than heat, went back for more.
There's a brighter, more heat-driven option in the green version - one that works beautifully to enliven the cheesy shrimp empanadas ($9 for two), a gluten-free, deep-fried version of Quiero CafÃ©'s signature dish that is encased in a crisp, arepa-like cornmeal dough.
If you opt to test out the hot sauces at your table, be sure to have a drink handy. A smoothie, like the coffee version ($5.50), gently bitter and sweetened with banana and honey, is a good option, as is a fresh-squeezed limeade ($5.50) or one of the four ice-blended frappÃ© "fruit juices," made with either water or milk. My favorite is lulo ($5.50), an astringent, citrus-like fruit whose spiky tang is blunted best by slugs of whole milk and a few spoonfuls of sugar.
As good as Quiero CafÃ©'s drinks are, sandwiches are the real stars of its wide-ranging menu. In particular, the choripan ($9), an Argentinian sandwich of char-grilled pork chorizo sausage, crimson pickled onions and aromatic dribbles of chimichurri sauce. Every bite reminded me of another of my favorite sandwiches: Vietnamese banh mi. And while I'd never call them cousins, the two are like Darwinian sparrows diverging in form and flavor, but eternally linked through a common DNA of crusty French bread and charcuterie.
Still, the best dish I tasted over three visits to Quiero CafÃ© was the Hot Dog Colombiano ($10), an over-the-top, libertine sandwich that one of my guests called "my new favorite sandwich in Portland." Maybe it was the snappy, garlicky beef hot dog that did the trick, or oversized, sweet-dough bun, or perhaps the indulgent layers of mozzarella, finely crumbled potato chips, sweet pineapple salsa, ketchup and mayonnaise, or the three hard-boiled quail's eggs. Who's to say?
All I can tell you is that I went back the next day at lunchtime for another, extending my decadence another 24 hours and amplifying it with an order of the crisp, savory, aioli-and-queso-fresco-topped yucca fries ($7).
Well, Quiero CafÃ©, it's official: te quiero. But keep making such bewitching sandwiches, and it won't be long before I'm ready to set my napkin down and commit to a full-throated te amo.

Texto completo: The foreign policy question (deep) underneath impeachment.
According to Donald Trump's Republican defenders, the impeachment spectacle unfolding in Washington, D.C., is all about policy differences rather than presidential misconduct, with career foreign policy bureaucrats cooking up excuses to remove a president whose worldview they disdain.
As is so often the case with defenses of our chief executive's conduct, this argument fails completely as a defense of Trump's own behavior, while nonetheless getting at something important about the larger political moment in the West.
It fails because in the specific case under scrutiny, Trump was clearly advancing no policy agenda beyond his own self-interest. Every attempt to depict the president as somehow anxious about corruption in the unstable Ukrainian republic founders on the accumulating evidence that he was only concerned about one case, the one case that happened to involve a political rival, and that he bent U.S. policymaking specifically with that one case in mind. His policy only differed from the policy of the bureaucracy in that its execution was premised on the extraction of a favor, a politically motivated ask.
[ Listen to "The Argument" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. ]
However, the president's defenders are right about this much: If you listened to the testimony from the witnesses this week, you could sense submerged beneath the critique of Trump's specific actions a larger policy worldview, one not so much argued for as simply assumed. All the people testifying believe that propping up Ukrainian democracy and supporting Kiev's struggle against Russian irredentism is an essential goal for U.S. foreign policy. All of them believe that Trump's behavior wasn't just wrong because it turned U.S. aid to partisan ends, but also because it undermined a vital policy objective that any patriotic American ought to share.
And this is why the Ukraine scandal is likely to be remembered as a theater-of-the-absurd moment in a more serious and longer-term debate: Because it is not only Trump himself who does not share the professionals' view of America's vital interests, but a great many people, voters and politicians, Democrats and Republicans.
Moreover, it is not only the United States where there is a gap between what the foreign policy establishment believes and what the public mood supports. And it is not only populists and troublemakers who are willing to doubt the policy vision that treats the constant enlargement of American commitments, NATO and European Union membership as an inevitable and necessary goal.
One prominent doubter is Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, who resisted attempts to involve the United States in Ukraine's military defense, and who spent his presidency conducting his own internal war against what one of his aides, anticipating Trump's deep-state complaints, described as the D.C. foreign policy "blob."
Obama fought a more civilized sort of bureaucratic war than Trump, with fewer ludicrous tweets and impeachable offenses. But it was a conflict over a similar question: To what extent should Western foreign policy prioritize democracy promotion east and southeast of the European core -- as opposed to pivoting to a different grand strategy that disengages from those regions for the sake of other ends?
Another doubter is the man often cast as a kind of anti-Trump, a liberal establishment's white knight -- the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has lately been arguing for a limit on the European Union's expansion and a friendlier relationship with Russia, while expressing skepticism about the workability of Article Five, NATO's mutual defense trigger.
These forays have earned Macron criticism from the same establishment figures who placed so much hope in his ascent. But really they should prompt a recognition that doubts about the West's security architecture aren't just the preserve of Russian trolls and isolationists. They reflect a deep and reasonable public uncertainty about the establishment's post-Cold War autopilot, the extension of American and European commitments far past what prudence and public opinion both will bear.
Admittedly, the alternative to that autopilot is hardly clear. For Obama, it was a Russian reset that failed and a pivot to Asia that Middle Eastern troubles kept sabotaging. For Trump, it's the containment of China and Iran by some sort of league of U.S.-friendly strongmen, with self-enrichment as a side benefit. For Macron, it might be a Europe that focuses more on internal integration in preparation for the challenge of migration waves to come.
But the uncertainty around alternatives will not prevent them from emerging, on the right and left alike, even if the establishment ultimately wins its war with Donald Trump. And if Trump's manifest corruption and buffoonery has strengthened that establishment in certain ways -- by persuading liberals, for instance, to subsume their skepticism of the national security state in newfound Russophobia -- his political resilience is also an indicator of the limits on its influence.
The Senate Republicans who are likely to ultimately vote for Trump's acquittal are unlikely to fully defend the specifics of his conduct. But the critique of American priorities that the professionals would like to see buried by association with his misconduct -- that critique will rise again.

Rosalía's win at the Latin Grammys hits a nerve

Texto completo: The Latin Grammys celebrated 20 years of 'the biggest night in Latin music' on Thursday, and the ceremony's biggest honor went to Rosalía, the Catalan singer whose flamenco-infused pop has propelled her to the verge of international superstardom.
While nominees for album of the year included Panamanian-born Latin jazz veteran Ruben Blades, Argentine rocker Andres Calamaro and Luis Fonsi " the Puerto Rican pop star whose 2017 smash 'Despacito' topped the Billboard chart for 17 weeks " it wasn't altogether surprising that Rosalía took home the trophy. Her exuberantly well-reviewed sophomore effort, 'El Mal Querer,' which blended flamenco styles with more modern genres including electronic and R-B, debuted atop Billboard's Latin pop albums chart last November and broke Spotify streaming records in her native Spain.
There is a long tradition of Spanish artists in Latin music, a genre that (at least within the music industry) has been defined as music recorded in the Spanish language. Since the first Latin Grammys telecast in 2000, the Latin Recording Academy " headquartered in Miami " has recognized Spanish (and Portuguese) musicians.
Honorees have included legendary Spanish crooner Julio Iglesias, his son Enrique Iglesias and Alejandro Sanz, a Spanish pop veteran. Sanz was the most-nominated artist at this year's ceremony, which aired on Univision.
Rosalía picked up five nods, making her the most-nominated female artist for the second consecutive year. She won in four of those categories, including best urban song for 'Con Altura,' an energetic ode to living life at full blast, featuring Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin and Spanish musician El Guincho, who co-produced 'El Mal Querer.'
There has been increasing debate about whether Spanish artists should win awards for Latin music, particularly when it comes to urban genres. The discussion went full-volume in September after the MTV Video Music Awards, where Rosalía performed 'Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi,' a reggaeton duet with Puerto Rican breakout star Ozuna. 'Con Altura' won the best Latin award at the event.
'I'm super proud of being Latino right now,' J Balvin said as he and Rosalía accepted the award. 'Thank you, because it's such an incredible honor,' Rosalía told the audience. 'I come from Barcelona. I'm so happy to be here representing where I come from and representing my culture.'
While Rosalía's VMA performance " a medley of songs including 'A Ningún Hombre,' her album's stunning final track " earned praise, the best Latin win raised eyebrows. The harshest assessments played out on social media, where critics weren't shy about pointing to Spain's brutal colonization of Latin America as the awkward elephant in the room.
It's a particularly complex discussion when it comes to reggaeton, which is rooted in black music including reggae, dancehall and hip-hop and was so heavily policed in Puerto Rico (cited, along with Panama, as a formative place for the genre) that it was forced underground in its early years. Artists such as Tego Calderon, Don Omar and Daddy Yankee " whose 2004 hit 'Gasolina' became the first reggaeton song to be nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for record of the year " helped usher reggaeton into the mainstream pop stratosphere.
But as the genre became more widely popular, 'there's an argument that reggaeton has shifted and has become whitened,' said Petra Rivera-Rideau, an assistant professor of American studies at Wellesley College who explored the rise of reggaeton amid evolving racial identities in her 2015 book, 'Remixing Reggaeton: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico.' Fonsi, she noted, was not known for making reggaeton before 'Despacito,' which featured Daddy Yankee and spawned a massively popular remix featuring Canadian pop star Justin Bieber.
While some fans (and media outlets) pointed out the fraught dynamic, the Rosalía backlash seems more prominent. 'I think what made Rosalía so surprising to some people is that she's from Spain,' Rivera-Rideau said.
Rosalía has clearly been embraced by reggaeton's biggest stars, but it's tough to overlook the fact that several heavy hitters were absent from Thursday's telecast. J Balvin and Daddy Yankee were among the artists protesting this year's Latin Grammy nominations, which relegated reggaeton stars to so-called urban genres even as they dominated Latin pop charts and racked up billions of views on YouTube. The dissonance was particularly felt during two standout performances from Ozuna and Sech, a rising Afro-Panamanian singer who cracked the Billboard 100 chart with his lovesick reggaeton ballad 'Otro Trago.'
It's also hard to ignore Rosalía's evolving aesthetic, which has included razor-sharp nails, slicked-down baby hair and " most recently " a chrome-colored mouth grill, which the singer wore in the music video for her gritty new single 'A Pale.' Fans of her crossover success, meanwhile, point to her intensive musical training. And her music projects an appreciation for multiple genres " she name-checks both salsa legend Hector Lavoe and her favorite flamenco singer, Cameron de la Isla, in 'Con Altura.'
The 26-year-old phenom's breakout has been elevated by showstopping performances at tour stops across the United States, Latin America and Europe. Her growing number of fans include stalwarts of Latin music.
'I think she's the only artist who can be compared to Beyonce in the Latin world,' Colombian rocker Juanes recently told the New York Times Magazine.
In the same article, the singer " who was named person of the year by the Latin Recording Academy ahead of Thursday's telecast " recalled seeing Rosalía sing for the first time two years ago.
'I wanted to die,' Juanes said. 'I mean, I had never felt something so strong with someone singing in front of me like what I felt that day, and on top of everything else she was such a young woman, you know? For me it was like seeing Carlos Gardel or Edith Piaf or someone like that sing.'

Texto completo: Playing the clock and asserting absolute immunity from law enforcement and congressional oversight, President Trump is asking the U.S. Supreme Court take up two cases to keep his personal income tax returns from government probers. The justices should decline and let Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance and Acting Chair Carolyn Maloney's House Oversight and Reform Committee get the documents from Trump's accountants.
The court's other option is to hear arguments and quickly issue unanimous rulings affirming the fact that holding the office of president does not exempt one's old financial records from legitimate review. Ignore the blather thrown up by Trump's attorneys. No one, not even a president, is immune to all scrutiny.
Even if they prevail in court, Vance and the oversight panel will not make the returns public. Nor will Chair Richie Neal's House Ways and Means committee, should he ever get the papers.
Three years ago, the Daily News and our crosstown competitor the New York Times were anonymously mailed pages from Trump's 1995 New York, New Jersey and Connecticut personal income tax returns. Unless someone wants to mail us more, the only path to transparency is for Albany to pass a law publishing the returns of all officeholders elected statewide.

Suspected neo-Nazi with ties to state faces federal gun charge in Texas

Texto completo: A suspected neo-Nazi with ties to Washington state is facing a federal gun charge after being arrested in Texas earlier this month.
When they were stopped for speeding Nov. 4, Aidan Bruce-Umbaugh and Kaleb Cole were wearing tactical gear and had a Sig Sauer 9mm pistol, an AR-15 rifle, two AK-47 rifles, at least 1,500 rounds of ammunition, and a small amount of marijuana and THC oil, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
Bruce-Umbaugh, 23, was in the passenger seat and said the guns and drugs belonged to him. He was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury, charged with possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of a controlled substance.
Both men are believed to have connections to a neo-Nazi hate group called the Atomwaffen Division, according to a Thursday news release from Erin Nealy Cox, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas.
A group called the Feuerkrieg Division (FKD), an offshot of the Atomwaffen, recently took credit for posting racist flyers outside a church in north Spokane.
The FBI and other investigators around the country have been working to crack down on members of Atomwaffen, which has been linked to a series of killings, according to the New York Times.
Bruce-Umbaugh "avoided eye contact and limited conversation" with law enforcement during the traffic stop and initially denied having anything illegal inside the vehicle, according to the criminal complaint as cited by the DOJ.
Neither he nor Cole, who was driving, is legally allowed to possess firearms. Cole's cache of weapons in Snohomish County was seized last month by Seattle authorities, who accused him of "preparing for a race war." The FBI in Seattle had sought a civil extreme risk protection order against Cole over the summer to require him to surrender his guns, KING-TV reports. Bruce-Umbaugh and Cole also have previous addresses in Whatcom County, records show.
Officials seized the firearms using a so-called red-flag law, which in a number of states including Washington allows law enforcement or civilians to get a court order to confiscate weapons when there is evidence that people are at high risk of harming themselves or others. Wyatt said the law provided a temporary intervention, allowing the seizure of the guns for up to a year.
At the end of 2018, Cole went on a 25-day trip that took him throughout Eastern Europe, according to the records filed by Seattle officials. He told federal officials who stopped him on his way home that the main reason was to see historical architecture and museums.
In a report filed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection about that day, officials wrote that Cole identified himself as an Atomwaffen member who had fascist ideology and that he had been carrying the group's flag.
Federal officials also examined Cole's cellphone, finding a recent image of a group of people performing Nazi salutes while holding the Atomwaffen flag, and another of two people standing on the railroad tracks leading into the complex that housed the Auschwitz concentration camp operated by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
Seattle officials filed their petition on Sept. 26 and seized the guns from Cole in Snohomish County the same day, Wyatt said. He did not show up for a subsequent hearing. Cole could not be reached for comment Thursday and did not appear to have an attorney.
Wyatt said law enforcement officials have continued discussing what criminal laws might apply to Cole's case. She said criminal statutes focus on threats made to an intended victim.
Federal investigators have also faced this issue as they struggle to balance First Amendment protections that allow hate speech and actions that could be an indicator of future violence. In some cases, the FBI has turned to local prosecutors to handle the cases.

Trump Jr. wraps up book tour Author defends father, attacks impeachment

Texto completo: Donald Trump Jr. finished his 10-day multi-city book tour on Friday the way he began, with a defense of his father and an attack on the impeachment investigation. There was one twist: The finale was in the most Democratic place in Florida, Broward County.
He found refuge from the South Florida majority on the 15th floor of a downtown Fort Lauderdale office tower, where he extolled the virtues of his book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," and of his father, President Donald Trump.
Trump Jr. decried the impeachment inquiry as "100% partisan hackery."
"Americans see this as the kangaroo court that it is," he said. "This isn't even American. If this was going on in any other country in the world, we'd be disgusted and we'd be writing outraged articles about it. But it is happening right here in this country in 2019."
Asked by the host, Ed Pozzuoli, CEO of the Tripp Scott law firm, what Republicans can do to keep Florida Republican next year, Trump didn't offer a specific strategy. "Watch the cheating. In all fairness, each and every time there's a problem, it all stems right here."
(While Florida elections, including last year's, have experienced multiple problems, there hasn't been evidence of or prosecutions for cheating. Since 2002, Florida elections have been overseen by secretaries of state, all of whom have been appointed by Republican governors.)
Trump brought up the controversy surrounding his book sales, bragging about landing this week at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. "I would have given any amount of money to be in the room when the New York Times had to make me No. 1."
But the ranking is controversial because it comes with a notation that it includes bulk purchases, something the book world views as a shady way to make a book seem as if it's doing better than it really is. Trump argued that even with the purchase of 10,000 copies by the Republican National Committee, his sales were double the number of the No. 2 book.
By Trump's reckoning, things are going so well in the country and his father is doing such good job that "2020 should be over," with a re-election.
Trump was at times in full-on attack mode during the 37 minutes he spoke and answered questions:
* Congressional Democrats, he asserted, don't want to do anything that could be seen as a Trump victory. "Do they dislike Trump or hate Trump so much more than they like America or Americans?"
* Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the probe into Russian meddling into the 2016 election, was too out of it to understand what was going on in the investigation he was ostensibly leading, he said. Pointing to Mueller's sometimes halting congressional testimony, he described the former special counsel as "a couple of decades past his prime."
* The news media "is basically one in the same" as the political left. "The media are the marketing wing for the Democratic Party."
* Joe Biden's use of a teleprompter (which President Trump sometimes uses) shows the former vice president isn't up to running for president. "If he's using teleprompters after being a 50-year career politician to talk to a group of 20 people, how are you going to do against Trump one-on-one for six months Joe? It's going to be awesome."
He was also, at times, funny, as when he described his inability to stop live tweeting when Mueller testified before Congress. "I have Tourette's of the thumbs, which is an inherited trait I am told."
Trump also showed some of the same fascination his father has with Elton John. The president has frequently compared his crowd sizes to John's concerts. Trump Jr. described his book sales as "about the same as Elton John did in his autobiography."
Trump was accompanied by his girlfriend, the former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle. "I affectionately call her my Puerto Rican knife fighter," he said.
"I said 'princess' too," he added.
She stood by him when he signed books, bought by the law firm for many of the 170 or so people who attended. She picked up each one from the stack, opened it, slid it to Trump, who scrawled a signature - with his father's favorite writing implement, a Sharpie pen.
Guilfoyle was outspoken during earlier book tour stops, including the two that generated the most attention, a combative appearance on the daytime TV show "The View" and an event at U.C.L.A. where conservative students shouted down the couple. On Friday she didn't say much, though she joked that she'd actually written her boyfriend's book.
Trump boasted that his appearances on "The View" generated outraged reactions that he said helped book sales. "I owned outrage last week. It was awesome."
Friday's invitation-only event was part of Tripp Scott's "Politics & Sunshine" series. Though the firm was founded and is led by prominent Republicans, it includes Democratic attorneys and periodically brings in speakers from both sides of the political aisle.
Pozzuoli said Trump was invited to give insight to interested clients, attorneys and staff. "Look at the headlines," he said. "It is timely."
Rick Fairchild of Vero Beach said he found Trump interesting. "He's a better communicator than I realized."
Clarence McKee, a Coral Springs communications consultant, said Trump hit a home run. "As a communicator, a triple plus," he said. "Passion, honesty - and we're going to kick the hell out of you."

Texto completo: Russia's ambassador to the United States says the exchanges are important for shaping common values. Also: Change in Mexico; middle-aged women.
To the Editor:
Re "Has a U.S. College Given Russia Too Friendly a Platform?" (Arts pages, Nov. 9):
The amount of Russophobia in the American media has been unprecedented in recent years. While anti-Russian rhetoric is used for internal political struggles in the United States from time to time, this propaganda campaign has reached absurd levels, spilling over into areas that have little to do with politics.
Russian culture is portrayed as a powerful tool of the Kremlin to manipulate American public opinion and burnish the image of Russia. The allegations have been substantiated by zero evidence.
Our countries can develop stereotype-free perceptions of each other only through frequent and authentic cultural exchanges, and most important, by shaping the common values that are necessary for ensuring a safe and prosperous future for the entire world.
Russia and the United States, as the largest nuclear powers and permanent members of the Security Council, bear a special responsibility for this. The mutual isolation that has gripped politics and economic issues should not affect our cultural relations.
It is important to stop seeking political expediency and consider both countries' long-term interests. Everyone benefits from greater cultural understanding between our two countries now and far into the future.

Saved by a 3-D Mammogram
To the Editor:
Re "Computers Join the Fight," by Susan Gubar (Living With Cancer, Science Times, Nov. 5):
I had a 2-D mammogram in 2015, and I was told that it was considered negative. In January 2016, I had a 3-D mammogram. My insurance did not cover it, but I elected to have it anyway.
It showed a small cancer in my right breast. The surgeon removed the lump and two lymph nodes, and she said she got it all. The lymph nodes were negative for cancer. I had radiation, and subsequent 3-D mammograms have been negative.
The doctor who performed the biopsy before the surgery in 2016 was the same doctor who read the 2-D mammogram in 2015. He remarked that when he looked at the 2015 2-D mammogram again in 2016, in retrospect he thought that he saw it.
Everyone should have a 3-D mammogram, and it should be compared with previous mammograms. Insurance companies should be paying for them for everyone.
I write this letter to honor my cousins, aunts and friends who died as a result of breast cancer.

Mexico Embraces 'Radical Change'
To the Editor:
In "Mexico's Fast Track Toward a Failed State" (column, nytimes.com, Nov. 7), Bret Stephens writes that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has no intention of rethinking his approach to security policy. I disagree.
In a speech marking the first 100 days of his administration and in his daily news conferences, the president has explicitly acknowledged that our security strategy has not yet yielded the desired results. He has assumed responsibility for the Culiacán operation that failed to capture the son of the drug lord El Chapo, and stressed the importance of rectifying and adjusting security strategy.
Contrary to Mr. Stephens's suggestion, only 10 percent of national guard members are deployed on our border with Guatemala, debunking his assertion of insufficient manpower to face cartels.
Furthermore, it is not true that much of the army is against President López Obrador. The comparison between Mexico and Iraq is flawed, and the use of the term "failed state" is ambiguous. In fact, our government is on a fast track to radical change.

An American (Middle-Aged) Woman
To the Editor:
Re "If Keanu Reeves's Date Can Embrace Looking Her Age, I Can Too," by Ali Drucker (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 6):
After more than 30 years of coloring my hair, I decided to follow all my prematurely gray ancestors and go natural. It was both an easy decision and a difficult one.
It was easy to let go of the brutal touch-up ritual, but hard to embrace the fact that at my age, 56 at the time, I was no longer "prematurely gray." Now that I'm 60, I find that I am struggling to accept myself as a genuine American-made, middle-aged woman.
While I love all the knowledge and wisdom acquired during six decades of living, I am still startled that I look like my mother when I pass a mirror! I am looking for that balance, that sweet spot in life to be able to joyfully project that I am still the me I've always been, just with a bit of wear and tear.
It is reality and I am looking for self-acceptance as much as acceptance from society. Thanks to Keanu Reeves and his lovely date, Alexandra Grant, for helping us see what's in front of us.

To Allies, No 'Witch Hunt,' Just a Big Waste of Time

Texto completo: Conservative allies of President Trump are borrowing from the Democrats' 1998 playbook, claiming the inquiry is all a waste of time.
They're not calling it a "coup" or a "witch hunt." There's no "deep state" hoax, and the phone call between President Trump and Ukraine's president wasn't "perfect."
Key conservative allies of Mr. Trump, many of whom have expressed concern about the lack of focus and consistency in the White House's public response to the impeachment inquiry against him, which continues with a second day of public hearings on Friday, have begun a campaign to shift public opinion before they lose any more ground.
The goal, according to the strategists behind the effort, is to cast the impeachment hearings unfolding in Washington as a circuslike distraction that does little to help people worried about health care, jobs and financial stability -- concerns that are far more front of mind for most Americans.
And the intended audience is the relatively few Americans in roughly two dozen congressional districts in a handful of battleground states who do not already have strong opinions about the president, and whose ambivalence toward both political parties is largely overshadowed in national polls showing widespread support for impeachment.
The argument is not entirely novel. Democrats may recognize its similarity to the one they used against Republicans in 1998 when they successfully portrayed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton as a partisan-driven exercise in futility. Conviction in the Senate at the time seemed unlikely, opening the door for Mr. Clinton's defenders to accuse Republicans of putting the country through a needless national trauma.
Today, Republicans have seen, in surveys they have conducted, that one of the most effective ways to defend Mr. Trump is to remind voters that they will have a say about his fate in less than a year, and that regardless of what happens in the Democratic-controlled House, the chances of the Republican Senate removing him from office are remote.
"Anyone running in a swing district or talking to voters in a swing state should be driving this very message: This is a complete waste of time, a complete waste of taxpayer dollars," said Jason Miller, a former strategist for Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.
To that end, part of the way Republicans plan to discredit the impeachment process is by claiming the hearings so far have uncovered little that is new, revelatory or damning. Even before the witnesses in Wednesday's hearing uttered a single word, the White House and its allies had already discussed how they should insist it was all a terrible bore that failed to live up to the hype.
The president's boosters in conservative news media were delivering this message while witnesses were still testifying.
"It's going to be a blockbuster. You're not going to want to miss this," Rush Limbaugh declared at the opening of his show on Wednesday, with several hours in the hearing yet to go. But then he concluded, "It has been flat-out boring."
Sean Hannity told his radio listeners almost the same thing. "This was supposed to be their big day. This was supposed to be their takedown day," he said. "It is just dull. It is just boring. It is just meaningless."
(For its part, the White House has not been absent from the fight. It has been arming its high-profile supporters and news media surrogates with talking points in a "What You Need To Know" email blast several times a day that rebuts Democrats' claims point by point. It also hosts regular messaging conference calls with conservative activists.)
Some of the groups and strategists involved in the push to reframe the impeachment hearings are veterans of the fight over the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh last year -- a multimillion dollar, nationwide campaign that marshaled the resources of virtually the entire conservative movement, from the libertarian-minded organizations funded by the Koch brothers to the National Rifle Association.
So far, impeachment has yet to galvanize that kind of broad-based coalition, in part because Mr. Trump remains a disliked and mistrusted figure by some conservatives, including among the leaders of the Koch network, whom he has personally attacked. And many of the policy-based groups that focus on guns, abortion or religion have no obvious role to play in a presidential impeachment.
But the groups that are involved are pressing ahead. Mike Davis, a Republican strategist who worked on the Kavanaugh confirmation, said his party's goal, until impeachment is resolved, should be "just talk to Americans using common sense." Republicans should not speak like lawyers, making points about "quid pro quo" as they often have, or invoke the names of Ukrainian officials, whom most Americans have probably never heard of. He advises them to "act like you are speaking to a high school-educated aunt you respect."
The Judicial Crisis Network, which spent millions in ads targeting Democratic senators during the Kavanaugh battle, recently conducted a poll it shared with other conservative groups to determine how voters viewed the impeachment proceedings. It found that voters were most persuaded by the argument that the impeachment inquiry was a reckless act by a dysfunctional, do-nothing Congress. This message was especially potent, the survey found, with voters in districts where Democrats won in 2018 but where Mr. Trump secured a majority in 2016. The takeaway for voters, said one Republican who saw the results, was, "I voted for these folks to go to Washington and get things done, and now they are all focused on impeachment."
And with the congressional hearings beginning their first public phase this week, conservative activists across the country have begun adopting this message in recent days.
"The Democrats are no longer a party, they are a circus," Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, said.
The American Action Network, an outside political group that supports Republican lawmakers, started a digital ad campaign in 37 swing districts this week challenging House Democrats to "get back to work on the issues that will actually make a difference in the lives of Americans across our country," the group said.
Democrats realize that they are not immune from these criticisms -- especially in their most competitive districts. And lawmakers who represent these districts, many of whom initially resisted starting impeachment proceedings, said they needed to demonstrate that they were spending adequate time on issues more urgently connected to their constituents' well being.
Representative Debbie Dingell, who represents a politically and economically diverse district outside Detroit, said that while she has heard from constituents who are upset about impeachment, there were also many who voiced concerns about maternal health care and prescription drug prices.
"We've got to keep doing our jobs," she said, which at the moment also involves the enormously fraught and historic obligation of deciding whether Mr. Trump should be the third president ever impeached. Though she found the charges from Republicans ironic -- "Mitch McConnell hasn't been doing anything in the Senate," she said -- she acknowledged the pressure. "You've got to get back to doing the business of the country," she said, paraphrasing what she often hears from voters.
And on Thursday Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that she had received the message too. She announced that the House was close to reaching an agreement with the Trump administration on a major trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.
But in the end, it may be Mr. Trump who ultimately determines his party's message. As his allies have learned, they can never predict whether he will work with them or improvise on his own.
"He'll stick to his game plan," said J. Kenneth Blackwell, a conservative activist who is on the board of directors of the N.R.A. "The question is, can we follow? Does he cut to the left, cut to the right or go straight up the field? If I'm ready to block to his right, and then all of a sudden he decides to cut left, well..." he added, trailing off.

Texto completo: When Destin Daniel Cretton begins filming Marvel's highly anticipated "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" in the new year, he'll consider it the second superhero movie he will have made.
The first is "Just Mercy" starring Michael B. Jordan as civil rights defense lawyer Bryan Stevenson, whose careerlong crusade to save individuals from the death penalty and effect criminal justice reform is about to get its own origin story onscreen.
After an awards-qualifying run in limited release beginning Christmas Day, the film will open nationwide on Jan. 10. But the attorney and activist at the center of "Just Mercy" entered the Hollywood spotlight in August after a special screening of the film in Los Angeles, when Cretton and actors Jordan, Brie Larson and Jamie Foxx - all of whom have Marvel movies on their resumes - assembled for an emotional Q&A. They were joined by Stevenson, who drew the biggest applause.
Based on the 2014 New York Times bestselling memoir "Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption," the film stars Jordan as the Delaware-born Stevenson, an eager young attorney whose compassion is awakened while working with clients on death row in the Deep South.
Foxx co-stars as Walter McMillian, an African American pulpwood worker sent to Alabama's death row in 1988 for the murder of a white woman, who maintains his innocence as his clock ticks down and his tenuous hopes for exoneration fade.
Directing a script he wrote with Andrew Lanham, Cretton tracks Stevenson's fight to overturn McMillian's death sentence and those of other inmates sentenced to die in Alabama, the only U.S. state that does not provide postconviction legal aid to the condemned.
It charts the early work with advocate Eva Ansley (Larson) that led to the 1989 founding of the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to battling racial and economic injustice, mass incarceration and excessive punishment.
Oscar-nominated producer Gil Netter ("The Blind Side," "Life of Pi") optioned "Just Mercy" and approached Cretton to direct. Cretton read the book and found himself crying - and, to his surprise, laughing - in coffee shops as he pored over Stevenson's elegantly pointed and poignant writing.
"These characters are so human, and I just felt like I knew them," Cretton remembered. "I felt like they were my friends. By the end of this book, where you're confronted with so many harsh truths, you expect to be depressed. But I somehow felt really hopeful and inspired."
Now based in Los Angeles and father to a toddler, Cretton admits he didn't always feel that way. "To me it's really hard to be both informed and yet hopeful ... and that, to me, is the power of Bryan Stevenson and his work."

Bloomberg targets Trump in $100 million battleground ad buy

Texto completo: Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman who is taking steps to run for president, has launched a $100 million digital ad campaign attacking President Trump in the battleground states expected to determine next year's election.
The effort will provide a significant boost to Democratic efforts " now totaling at least $325 million in public commitments " to keep the heat on Trump while Democratic candidates battle each other to win the party's presidential nomination.
'Our thinking is that the general election has already begun,' said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman.
The outlay, which far exceeds what any Democratic candidate has raised or spent so far in the race, adds to those of several other outside groups who have devoted money to early swing state campaigns.
Priorities USA, an independent Democratic nonprofit and super PAC effort, has already spent about $7 million of a $100 million campaign for swing state anti-Trump advertising during the primaries. American Bridge, a group that typically focuses on opposition research, launched a $3 million campaign this week focused on rural white voters as part of an effort expected to reach $50 million.
A third group, Acronym, which is being advised by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, has announced plans for $75 million in digital ads against Trump.
The money is intended to challenge the significant advantages of incumbency in presidential campaigns. Trump's campaign announced $156 million in cash on hand at the end of September, after raising $125 million in the previous three months.
By contrast, the top fundraising Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has raised less than $75-million through the first three quarters of the year. former vice president Joe Biden, who has led national nomination polls this year, has raised less than $38-million in the same nine months.
Trump has also dominated Democratic candidates so far on digital spending. On Facebook, the Trump campaign and its affiliates have purchased $14.7 million in ads this year, according to the social network, compared with $5.45 million by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and $4.3-million by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
Much of the early digital spending by candidates is focused on prospecting for more campaign donors, not on persuading swing state voters. An analysis by Priorities USA of recent Trump Facebook ads found that 89 percent of the messages were focused on acquiring new donors and voter information, including spots that ask people to wish Trump a happy birthday or buy campaign gear.
'Sometimes you spell 'desperation' d-e-m-o-c-r-a-t-s,' Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said in response to the news of the new Bloomberg digital effort, which was first reported by the New York Times.
A pro-Trump independent effort, the America First Action super PAC and an affiliated group, has announced a fundraising goal of $300 million for the 2020 cycle to defend Trump in battleground states. That spending is expected to focus on Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.

In one Bloomberg ad provided to The Washington Post, Trump's Twitter feed is highlighted along with the message: 'A tweet shouldn't threaten our country's security.'
The digital campaign began Friday, with plans for spending in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, according to Bloomberg aides. They said Bloomberg will not appear in the ads, which will nonetheless make clear he paid for them.
'If Mike runs, it is because he believes that Donald Trump is an existential threat, and this demonstrates his commitment to defeating him,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Bloomberg.
Bloomberg, one of the world's richest men, has taken several steps to prepare for a bid for the Democratic nomination, including filing paperwork in states with early deadlines to get on the ballot. He has also been calling top party officials to let them know of his plans.
The move marks a major reversal for Bloomberg, who announced in March that he would not run for president. At the time, he said he was 'clear-eyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination' and would instead focus on spending his money in an effort to hurt Trump's chances in swing states.
But he and his advisers have since concluded that there is a possible route to the nomination because of lingering divisions in the field and the vulnerabilities of the top-polling candidates.
The decision to reconsider signals, among other things, a public rebuke of Biden's performance so far. The former vice president has attempted to build a coalition of the same moderate Democrats that Bloomberg would court.

Salon accused of hair-based racism agrees to training, $70,000 fine

Texto completo: NEW YORK - A luxury Upper East Side hair salon accused of telling Black workers that Afros and box braids did not fit the area's upscale image will train employees to work with Black hair and help advance the careers of stylists who are not white, city officials said Tuesday.
The salon, Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger, agreed to the measures as part of a settlement with New York City's Human Rights Commission that grew out of an investigation prompted by former employees' complaints about hair-based racial bias.
The settlement, which also calls for the salon to pay a $70,000 fine, was the first to be reached since the commission's February release of legal guidelines recognizing discrimination on the basis of hairstyle as racial discrimination.
"This resolution is another step toward ensuring that racist notions of professional appearance standards are not applied in New York City," Carmelyn P. Malalis, the commission's chairwoman, said in a statement.
The settlement calls for the salon to team up with a New York City styling school with expertise in the care and styling of Black hair for two purposes: to instruct and inform current employees and to start an internship program specifically for stylists from underrepresented groups.
In addition, the commission said, Sharon Dorram, a colorist, and Tim Lehman, a senior stylist, must complete 35 hours of community service with a racial justice group "that works to combat hair discrimination and promote Black beauty."
Sally Hershberger did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via her publicist. Dorram and Lehman could not immediately be reached. Steve Tuttleman, whom the commission identified as an owner of the salon with Hershberger and Dorram, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The salon, which occupies the top two floors of a town house on East 71st Street, is a favorite of celebrities like Meg Ryan and Kate Hudson. Hershberger is known for her $1,000 haircuts and "24K" hair products in gold-trimmed black packaging. Her clients have included Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Dorram has worked for Christie Brinkley and Renée Zellweger.
Hershberger also operates salons in New York at Barneys on Madison Avenue, on West 26th Street and at the Hudson Yards complex, and in West Hollywood, California. The settlement reached with the commission applies to all of Hershberger's New York outlets.
Hershberger's Upper East Side salon was among several businesses to be investigated by the commission after employees complained about being discriminated against because of their hair. The investigations led the commission to adopt the new guidelines. A commission spokeswoman said that several businesses remain under investigation.
In the case of the salon, four former workers filed complaints from 2016 to 2018. The first was from a former general manager who was white and said he was sickened by having to enforce a dress code and hair policy that was applied more strictly to Black workers than white ones.
Interviewed for an earlier New York Times article, the former manager, David Speer, said that Dorram pushed for the dress code only after he hired three Black women - Taren Guy, Raelene Roberts and Regine Aubourg - as receptionists.
In a text message written by Dorram, one of several Speer shared with The Times, she criticized the receptionists' appearance.
"Today looked awful," she wrote, saying that Roberts "had her dreads down" and that Aubourg "just got hers to match as long." Dorram added: "All 3 at desk and we look like we should be on E. 134th Street.' (Dorram said in February that the hair policy was not racially motivated and that her text messages had been mischaracterized.)
Believed to be the first of their kind in the United States, the city's guidelines prohibit the targeting of people based on their hairstyle at work and school and in public places. They specifically cite the right to maintain "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/ or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed stare."
Since New York City introduced the rules, New York state, New Jersey, California and Montgomery County, Maryland, have adopted similar measures.
There is no legal precedent in federal court for protection against hair-based racial discrimination. In 2018, the Supreme Court declined to consider a case brought by a Black woman who had a job offer from an insurance company rescinded after she would not cut off her dreadlocks.
Last month, a Queens woman invoked the city and state guidelines in a federal lawsuit brought against Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy in Jamaica, Queens. In the suit, the woman, Lavona Batts, accused the school of discriminating against her son, who is Black and was starting his first year there, by saying he could not wear his hair in braids.
The boy, a third-grader, was "very proud of his hair," Batts said in the suit. "He considers his hair to be an important part of his identity and he has no intentions of changing his hairstyle.'

It doesn’t matter who the Trump whistleblower is

Autor: Black, Eric.

Texto completo: Why are Republicans wasting their fire on the demand that the whistleblower be outed?
As a technical matter, it would be an overstatement to say that the “whistleblower” who first brought to the public second-hand evidence that President Donald Trump was pressuring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens if he wanted to get frozen military assistance unfrozen, is entitled to have his anonymity respected. But not much of an overstatement.
According to this New York Times explainer, the Inspector General Act says that agency watchdogs “shall not, after receipt of a complaint or information from an employee, disclose the identity of the employee without the consent of the employee, unless the inspector general determines such disclosure is unavoidable.”
Some Trump loyalists reportedly think they know the identity. The POTUS himself seems to think he knows, and knows that the whistleblower is a “never Trumper,” which he seems to think proves that any information coming from such sub-humans is tainted and should be ignored.
For reasons that are both obvious and a little sickening, Republicans spent much of their early fire during Wednesday’s first day of impeachment hearings on demanding that the whistleblower be identified and produced for questioning. Why?
On a substantive basis, it seems unnecessary. The whistleblower didn’t claim to have direct personal knowledge of the information he brought to light. He was passing along second-hand accounts that had reached him and which suggested that Trump was tying the release of stalled military aid to Ukraine to Zelensky investigating Hunter Biden and publicly announcing such an investigation. (If there’s one thing Trump can’t abide, it’s anyone seeking to benefit from family connections.)
The whistleblower’s identity, and his or her politics, seem fundamentally irrelevant. Even if you believe he was biased, the impeachment inquiry no longer depends on anything the whistleblower wrote or whistled. Many witnesses, with more direct knowledge of the underlying facts, have been identified. Two of them testified Wednesday. More will testify today (former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch) and next week. She, and those who follow, will be asked about things they know first-hand.
Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff made clear that outing the whistle-blower was unnecessary and he would not participate in it. Republicans on the committee made clear that they want him outed. And they may yet find a way to do so.
But the facts of the case will be brought to light through the testimony of named witnesses who have direct knowledge. Identifying the whistle-blower might be fun for Trump and his supporters, but, even if the whistleblower was an axe-murderer or, even worse, a never-Trumper, that has nothing to do with the facts of the case and is a pitifully transparent effort to distract from those facts, which will be laid out by witnesses with more direct knowledge.
(After I wrote the above, I read news that U.S. Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, who might be called an “always Trumper,” claimed to know that the whistleblower was Alex Soros, son of billionaire George Soros. King tweeted out four pictures of the younger Soros, posing with four prominent Democrats — Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren — which in some bizarre world apparently implied that this was evidence that Soros was the whistleblower. He has since deleted the tweet, but you can see the photos, which have no discernible connection to Ukraine or the whistleblower issue, here.)
How pitiful is this?
If you follow the public discussion of this bring-forth-the-whistleblower campaign, you will hear Trumpists claim that, without access to the whistleblower, Trump is being denied his fundamental “right to confront his accuser.”
This is nonsense. For starters, nothing the whistleblower said is being used as evidence. The whistleblower is more like the confidential informant who told the cops that he heard about who might’ve robbed the bank. It’s not evidence, unless the prosecutor puts that guy on the stand.
The right to confront your accuser pertains to a person, on trial for a crime, to be in court and hear the prosecution witnesses testify against him, and to cross-examine them (or have his lawyers do so).
Those rules don’t literally apply to an impeachment case. But even if they did, the trial, if one occurs, will be in the Senate, where Trump can presumably attend if he wants, confront his “accusers,” and will be represented by Senate Republicans committed to ensuring he gets due process.
One thing I can pretty much guarantee: The “leaker” will not be on the Senate floor to serve as Trump’s “accuser.” But if he is there, and Trump wants to confront him, that will shed little or no light on the question before the “court.”
The question is: Did President Donald Trump withhold urgently needed military aid to an ally, Ukraine, fighting against Russian invasion and occupation, and did Trump imply that he might be willing to release said aid if Ukraine did him a favor by investigating (and publicly announced that it was investigating) allegations of corruption against the Bidens?
It seems an important question. More important than the question of who leaked second-hand information that causes us to ask the more important question above. But, of course, anyone who thinks that must be a never-Trumper, so never mind.

Texto completo: Just as, when feeling a great urge to see your taxes cut, you don’t turn to the president pro tempore of the California state Senate to get the job done tout de suite, you don’t look for help saving all creatures wise and wonderful, including ourselves, by asking a species denier for help.
You know who I mean when I say species denier. It’s the people who howl bloody human murder whenever environmentalists try to protect some little flora or fauna they have never heard of, or can’t eat.
The delta smelt is the great California example. Who gives a damn, goes the denier logic, about a little fish nobody in their right non-ichthyologic mind has ever heard of, and that even the enviros have a hard time finding one example of?
Yes, the delta smelt is very tiny. And it has held up much transfer of water from north to south in a vast state, as have other ecological considerations. I wouldn’t recognize one if it happened to swim by. But thank all that is good for the people who would, and who understand that by saving the little things, we save the rest of us well.
I was thinking of this plain fact recently when considering the possible loss of the Joshua trees in our desert because of climate change. Unlike the delta smelt, everyone loves a Joshua tree. We have a whole national park that celebrates them. So many of us, including the species deniers — the kind who claim they wouldn’t miss a smelt or two, or, on the flora side, some weed or another, I suppose — would miss them.
And yet, as our staff writer Matt Kristoffersen reported in August: “Because of climate change, however, roughly 80% of the habitat for the famous plants in Joshua Tree National Park might not survive past 2100 — and that’s being optimistic, UC Riverside scientists conclude in a new study. Researchers at UCR’s Center for Conservation Biology, among other institutes, published the study in June in the journal Ecosphere. It confirms what scientists said years ago in previous studies: the trees’ fate is in the hands of humans.”
They are beloved despite what a National Park Service guide given out at the park calls “their grotesque appearance.” Yucca brevifolia is a member of the agave family. As in tequila. It’s very hard to estimate their age: “They’re yucca plants, so they don’t grow with rings, like a tree, so you can’t count their age that way,” a former ranger told The New York Times. “All we can do is make estimates.”
They grow about half an inch inch to three inches annually, so tree people use a Joshua tree’s height to guess its age. The tallest ones in the park are about 40 feet. They may therefore be about 150 years old, though no one knows.
And if climate change continues at the accelerating rate that it is, the 160,000 acres across the park that have supported Joshua trees since before humans lived here could fall to just 37 acres by 2100. Because it’s getting hotter, and drier, and they won’t make it if we keep going as we are.
I grew up camping and climbing and staring at the Joshua trees there, as my parents did before me, as my daughter has done after. I want the great-grandkids to have the same chance.
Told of that news, Kathryn Phillips, the director of Sierra Club California — also a former reporter here — said: “When I hear stuff like that, it motivates me. I’m not the kind of person that wants to roll up into a fetal position and cry. I want to take action and fight back.”
If you are worried that perhaps you are not concerned enough about the big things, find some little plant or critter to worry about. Help protect it. Then we big things can ride on its coattails.

Texto completo: Usuarios en redes sociales como Twitter han llamado a un boicot al canal de televisión VH1 luego de que la empresa anunciara que Emma Coronel, esposa del convicto narcotraficante Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, aparecerá en un episodio de la segunda temporada del “ reality show” “Cartel Crew “.
“VH1 tiene que ser boicoteado por tratar de darle glamur a estupideces como carteles de la droga / distribuidores de burdeles matones y criminales. Nosotros no necesitamos este tipo de mierda”, dijo en un tuit Esther Ramos.
VH1 has to be boycotted by glamorizing stupidities like drug cartels/dealers brothels thugs and criminals. we don't need this type of CRAP https://t.co/QxxfG0H1YH

Otros disgustados por la presencia de la exreina de belleza en el episodio de este próximo 18 de noviembre criticaron el hecho de que con el destaque de la esposa del exlíder del Cartel de Sinaloa se “glorifica” al narco.
“¿Por qué diablos están glorificando a la esposa de El Chapo? Cientos de personas han sufrido por esta familia y su cartel. Pero, oye, ¿a quién le importa la moral cuando tienes que producir ‘shows’ de mierda para hacer dinero, cierto?”.
@MTV @VH1 @Viacom Why the hell are you glorifying El Chapo’s wife? Thousands of people have suffered because of this family and cartel. But hey, who care about morals when you have to produce crap shows to make some money, right?
— Esther Ramos (@MBMBaMino) November 13, 2019
Why is @VH1 putting el chapo wife on tv? I mean, I know *why* (ratings and money) but what the fuck?! after the recent murders related to cartel and innocents being killed, it's really tone deaf. time to flush the state of media at this point
— rob (@goof) November 13, 2019
Las críticas no se han limitado a usuarios que no son figuras públicas. El escritor especializado en temas criminales y de narcos, Don Winslow, con éxitos de ventas del New York Times, catalogó de “asquerosa” la decisión del canal.
“Esto es realmente asqueroso”, compartió en un tuit el autor en el que etiquetó al servicio de televisión por suscripción.
Por su parte, el periodista mexicano Ioan Grillo retuitió el mensaje de Winslow al que agregó que es una “decisión enferma y terrible de VH1”, ya que el cartel ha creado una “catástrofe humanitaria en México ”.
This is a sick and terrible decision by VH1 to have El Chapo's wife Emma Coronel on its reality show "Cartel Crew." There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Mexico from cartel violence. This is not a glamorous reality show. Where are images of mass graves?https://t.co/MaLGUquIIM
— Ioan Grillo (@ioangrillo) November 12, 2019
El Chapo cumple una sentencia de cadena perpetua más 30 años tras ser declarado culpable el 12 de febrero pasado en la corte federal de Brooklyn, en Nueva York . El mexicano fue hallado culpable de los 10 cargos en su contra por parte de un jurado de 12 miembros que deliberó por seis días e incluso pidió copia de varios testimonios y aclaraciones específicas al juez sobre detalles de la evidencia.
Durante, aproximadamente, tres meses de juicio en la sala del juez Brian Cogan, 14 de los antiguos colaboradores de Guzmán, y otros 42 testigos de la Fiscalía hablaron sobre los crimenes del acusado.
Algunos de los cargos que pesaban contra el narco eran: participación en una empresa criminal continua, conspiración internacional para manufacturar y distribuir cocaína, heroína, metanfetamina y marihuana, y uso de armas de fuego.
Actualmente, Guzmán Loera permanece en la prisión de máxima seguridad en Florence, Colorado, mejor conocida como ADX o como el “Alcatraz de las Rocosas”.

Tennessee company will take over ER staffing at both of Washington County's hospitals

Texto completo: A Tennessee company that has fought ongoing national efforts to eliminate some large, surprise medical bills will soon become the employer of ER doctors in Washington County's two small hospitals.
In March, Envision Physician Services will take over the staffing of the emergency departments at Calais Regional Hospital and Down East Community Hospital in Machias. It will replace a much smaller Maine-based company, BlueWater Health, that has provided the ER doctors to those hospitals in recent years.
Both hospitals said that the new contract with Envision will save them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Cutting costs is a particular priority for Calais Regional Hospital, which recently declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy after losing money every year since 2011. The leaders of both hospitals have also been unable to negotiate new contracts with the unions representing their nurses.
For now, Envision said that it plans to maintain a similar level of staffing as BlueWater has at those hospitals. Like BlueWater, it will keep at least one doctor in each of the emergency departments at all hours, seven days a week. BlueWater has also provided a second worker, usually a physician assistant or nurse practitioner, to staff the ERs at night. Envision spokeswoman Aliese Polk said the company will provide additional staff if needed.
Both hospitals paid roughly $2.5 million to BlueWater for its services in 2017, according to their most recently available tax filings. DeeDee Travis, vice president of community relations at Calais Regional Hospital, said the hospital will save about $900,000 a year by switching to Envision. Julie Hixson, marketing director at Down East Community Hospital, estimated that the Machias hospital would save several hundred thousand dollars with the switch.
Travis and Hixson both said that their hospitals have had a good relationship with BlueWater but that Envision will be able to offer strong care while reducing costs. Each hospital is entering a three-year contract with the company.
"It really came down to finding a better fit for the financial viability of the hospital, while maintaining the high bar we set for quality of care," Calais Regional Hospital CEO Rod Boula said in a written statement.
The change will not significantly affect BlueWater, a small but growing company that provides physician staffing in Maine, Vermont and Massachusetts, according to Jay Mullen, an emergency medicine doctor who serves as its CEO. But Mullen did question whether a large national company will be able to recruit and retain physicians as well as his operation can in a rural place such as Washington County. He said that few of BlueWater's providers are considering working for Envision when it takes over.
"It can be incredibly difficult to recruit and retain high-quality emergency physicians and advance practice providers in remote places like this," Mullen said. "Large contract management groups like Envision have access to physicians that they'll fly in from Texas or Ohio, but that's not usually in the best interest of the community or hospital for that to be a long-term solution."
Polk, the Envision spokesperson, said that the company "is dedicated to serving patients in rural America and recognizes that the clinicians who live and work in the area understand the unique needs of the community. We want to provide care alongside them and have offered employment to all the clinicians currently working at the hospitals."
Envision's parent company -- which was acquired last year by the private equity company KKR in a $9.9 billion deal -- has lobbied against recent efforts by Congress to eliminate the steep costs that can come from a practice known as surprise, out-of-network billing, according to The New York Times.
That happens when patients suffering a medical emergency go to a hospital that accepts their health insurance but see a doctor who is not part of their insurance network, resulting in a steep bill that their insurer may not agree to cover.
Recent research from Yale University has found that when Envision and one of its competitors entered hospital emergency rooms between 2011 and 2015, a greater share of patients who had insurance accepted by the hospitals ended up receiving those shocking out-of-network bills, which can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars out of a patient's own pocket.
Polk did not directly respond to a question about whether patients in Washington County may receive out-of-network bills. "In an emergency, patients should not be forced to make financial decisions ahead of medical ones," she said in a statement. "For patients, seeking the most appropriate care is the priority, and we are committed to working with insurance companies to provide patients with access to care when they need it most."
But the company has previously said that it would work to have more of its doctors accept insurance, and a spokesperson recently said that 90 percent of its care is in-network, The New York Times reported in September.
The hospitals in Washington County said that they do not expect patients to receive out-of-network bills after seeing Envision providers if the hospitals generally accept their insurance.
At Calais Regional Hospital, the contract with Envision will require its providers to have credentials from all the insurance programs that the hospital already accepts, according to Travis.
Down East Community Hospital does not having anything in its contract that would specifically prevent Envision providers from staying outside the hospital's insurance networks, but Hixson said that "this would not be an issue" because the Machias hospital will not outsource its coding or billing to Envision, as some hospitals do.
Envision already does provide some staffing at another Maine hospital in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Penobscot Valley Hospital in Lincoln. That hospital's CEO, Crystal Landry, did not respond to a request for comment.
Another physician staffing company that has opposed the federal effort to rein in surprise bills, TeamHealth, gained a foothold in Maine early this year when it began contracting with Northern Light Health to employ the emergency room and hospitalist doctors at the system's hospitals in Blue Hill, Ellsworth, Pittsfield and Waterville. It more recently took over the emergency department staffing at Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital in Presque Isle.
A Northern Light spokeswoman, Suzanne Spruce, said "there have been no issues" with patients receiving out-of-network bills since the contract with TeamHealth began. She also said that the contract prevents TeamHealth from "balance billing," a term that refers to when a provider bills patients for any additional amount that an insurer won't cover.

Texto completo: WARNING: Parts of this column may bear strong resemblance to my earlier columns when Michael Bloomberg toyed with running for president, because with Bloomberg, history has a way of repeating itself. Every four years, Michael Bloomberg hears something virtually no other American hears: a groundswell of support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy. Now, as the 2020 Democratic primaries rapidly approach, he’s hearing it again.
Bloomberg, a fairly successful mayor of New York and a fabulously successful businessman, has an estimated net worth of $52 billion. Without that fortune, nobody would be talking about a Bloomberg candidacy at this late date. But with his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. This time, Bloomberg, who in his political life has been a Democrat, a Republican, an independent and now a Democrat again, is setting a personal record by flirting twice in a single cycle. Last spring, there was a ripple of speculation about a 2020 Bloomberg candidacy. On March 5, Bloomberg put an end to it when he announced flatly, "I’m not running for president." Instead, he said, he would pour his energy and resources into a new climate change project called Beyond Carbon. Now, however, he has apparently moved beyond Beyond Carbon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Bloomberg is "actively preparing to enter the Democratic presidential primary."
Bloomberg is said to be concerned — and it is a legitimate concern — that the current Democratic field has moved too far left. But there is no indication that voters believe Bloomberg is the solution to the problem. This latest tease is too recent for any reliable polling — although one survey found Bloomberg with the highest negatives in the field — but in the past, he has never been a voter favorite outside the confines of New York City.
Bloomberg is being pressed into action by states with early primary filing deadlines. He has already placed his name on the ballot for the Alabama primary, and a short time later flew to Arkansas to file there. Alabama and Arkansas are fine, but what about Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the first states to cast votes and award delegates? Bloomberg has apparently decided to blow them off.
Candidates in the past have sometimes tried to skip an early primary or caucus, but skipping all four at the beginning is a sure way to lose.
Bloomberg’s move is a symptom of Democratic anxiety. We’ve seen it before, in both parties. At the beginning of a primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, "Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches!" Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, "Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?"
The answer is no. The Democratic field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Donald Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Michael Bloomberg.

Texto completo: The comedy sequel is part of a continuing deal between the streaming giant and Paramount, a studio without a streaming service of its own.
Netflix is doubling down on the Eddie Murphy business.
The streaming giant behind "Dolomite Is My Name," Murphy's acclaimed return to movies, will produce and release on its service a new installment in the "Beverly Hills Cop" franchise, as part of a licensing deal with Paramount Pictures. The comedian will star and Jerry Bruckheimer will return to produce. Netflix also has the rights to produce a potential second film.
Viacom, the parent company of Paramount, announced the news during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. Netflix declined to comment.
The agreement is part of Paramount Pictures' continuing partnership with Netflix. The two entities joined forces soon after Jim Gianopulos became chief executive of Paramount in 2017. The studio supplied the streaming giant with "13 Reasons Why" and "Maniac," among other series. The two companies also collaborated to debut "The Cloverfield Paradox" on Netflix in a marketing stunt following the 2018 Super Bowl. Paramount similarly unloaded the horror film "Eli" to the streaming service in addition to the international rollout of the sci-fi drama "Annihilation."
The announcement follows Viacom's news Wednesday that its Nickelodeon division will create and produce original animated feature films and television series based on its stable of beloved properties, including "SpongeBob SquarePants" and "The Loud House" for Netflix. Without a streaming service of its own, Viacom is diversifying its revenue streams by selling content to the competing services.
Paramount isn't abandoning its long-term relationship with Murphy, who starred in the recent release "Dolemite" after an extended hiatus from the big screen. The studio just wrapped production on the sequel to his 1988 comedy "Coming to America" with Murphy reprising his role as Prince Akeem, the pampered royal from the fictional African nation Zamunda. Set to open in December 2020, the film reunites most of the original cast, including Arsenio Hall and James Earl Jones. It is being directed by the "Dolomite" filmmaker Craig Brewer, from a script by the "black-ish" creator Kenya Barris (who has an exclusive production deal with Netflix).
The deal between Paramount and Netflix is indicative of the current struggle in the movie business. With the streaming wars raging, studios are faced with answering the increasingly tough question of what will perform theatrically. In the past, films based on well-known characters and successful origin stories were surefire hits. But with streaming services changing consumer behavior faster than you can say Disney Plus, this is no longer the case. Sequels to "Men in Black," "Godzilla" and "X-Men," among others, have all disappointed at the box office this year. Paramount, too, got caught in the sequel trap, struggling with the recently released "Terminator" reboot, but finding success with the reboot to "Pet Sematary," the theatrical version of "Dora the Explorer" and the musical "Rocketman," centering on Elton John's life.
"The Beverly Hills Cop" franchise, for one, has been a study in diminishing returns. While the first film was a phenomenon, grossing $ 316 million worldwide in 1984 (more than $ 780 million in today's dollars) and establishing Murphy as a bona fide movie star, "Beverly Hills Cop II" (1987) earned $ 299 million and "Beverly Hills Cop III," opening a decade after the original, grossed $ 119 million worldwide.

Texto completo: A Trump supporter says she encounters "looks of disgust and shock" and longs for events to bring together those with opposing views.
To the Editor:
Re "And in This Corner, Wearing a Red Name Tag ..." (news article, Nov. 4), about events nationwide that bring people together in an effort to bridge the partisan divide:
As a Republican living in New York, I would like nothing more than to find a group like this gathering to discuss differing views civilly. I find myself checking all around me in a hush-hush manner before I express my support for President Trump's policies. Looks of disgust and shock are what make me a closet Republican. I would love to "come out" and find some understanding and acceptance.

Texto completo: The British humanitarian accomplished enormous feats in alleviating the suffering of civilians in Syria.
On Monday morning, James Le Mesurier, the founder of Mayday Rescue, a charity that supported and trained the White Helmets, the Syrian civil defense group, was found dead in Istanbul. His body was found outside a building in the Beyoglu district where he had an apartment and office. It is unclear whether Mr. Le Mesurier, who was 48 and healthy, fell or was pushed from the balcony of his apartment. The Turkish authorities have started an investigation.
Mr. Le Mesurier, a former British Army officer, had worked in Iraq and Kosovo before turning his attention to Syria. He was committed to ensuring war-torn communities learn how to take care of themselves when no one else was coming to save them. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2016 for his work.
The White Helmets are emergency medical workers. They have, according to their own estimate, rescued about 115,000 people and lost more than 250 of their own volunteers -- they have a high chance of being killed themselves when they rush to the scene of a bombing. This was the world the funny, smart, brave and principled Mr. Le Mesurier worked in.
His work earned him many detractors, including Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Three days before his mysterious death, Ms. Zakharova claimed that Mr. Le Mesurier was a "former agent of Britain's MI6, who has been spotted all around the world."
Most foreign correspondents, humanitarian workers and United Nations officials frequently get landed with the sobriquet. There is no evidence that Mr. Le Mesurier was a spy.
I saw him as a humanitarian who accomplished enormous feats in alleviating the suffering of civilians in Syria. I first encountered him after spending time in Aleppo during the terrible days and nights of fierce aerial bombardment, where barrel bombs were dropped on the city by the Syrian regime's jets.
I have been under fierce bombardment before -- in Sarajevo, Chechnya and Iraq -- but Syria was something else. The sheer terror of civilians buried under the weight of concrete buildings, sometimes for hours, sometimes for days, was unforgettable.
Mr. Le Mesurier's concept of the White Helmets was to train civilians to look after their neighbors, to pull them out of the rubble, to bring them back to life. He always told me that people were more likely to search for others if they knew it was a member of their community. "If you get buried, you know someone is looking out for you," he said. "Someone is coming for you. This is how community strengthening works."
The White Helmets were formed in 2014. Soon after, Khaled Omar Harrah, a former home decorator and father of two, pulled a 10-day-old baby, who had been buried for 16 hours, out of the wreckage of a building. The YouTube video went viral. Mr. Harrah was killed in an airstrike in 2016.
By then, the White Helmets were superheroes. They were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. A Netflix documentary about their work won an Academy Award in 2017, and Hollywood stars signed petitions in solidarity. George Clooney bought the rights to a film about them.
But the White Helmets had dangerous enemies, most notably those attached to Russia. By 2015, the Russians had joined the dogfight over the skies of Aleppo as a partner to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The Russians bombed many civilian targets, including hospitals. The White Helmets became more vulnerable; more than half were killed in "double-tap" strikes, where Syrian regime and Russian warplanes returned to the site of a bombing to target the rescue workers.
The Russians unleashed an army of trolls to discredit the White Helmets by branding them "Al Qaeda." Mr. Le Mesurier took on these adversaries, dismantling their accusations about funding and the lies the White Helmets supposedly spread about Russian and Syrian government attacks.
There were also personal slurs, about his character and his background in the British Army, from pro-Assad trolls and bloggers, but he shrugged them off with a kind of nonchalance. The only time I saw him get truly angry was when one of the trolls mentioned his wife, Emma Winberg, who works for Mayday. She was asleep in their apartment at the time of his death.
Mr. Le Mesurier's enemies were persistent and their reach was wide. According to a study by One Syria Campaign, an international advocacy group, "Bots and trolls linked to Russia have reached an estimated 56 million people with tweets attacking Syria's search and rescue organization, the Syria Civil Defense -- also known as the White Helmets -- during ten key moments of 2016 and 2017."
Since the Russians joined the war in 2015, the White Helmets have been filming attacks on opposition-held areas with GoPro cameras affixed to their helmets. I was told by countless United Nations officials and human rights activists that what the Russians feared most was evidence that could land them before a war crimes tribunal.
The White Helmets caught the Russians red handed and recorded their crimes on video. In a secret villa on the grounds of the United Nations Office in Geneva, a group of forensic experts are going through thousands of hours of videos and photographs made by civilians and others, which will hopefully one day bring justice. Syria is probably the most-documented war ever.
I often spoke with Mr. Le Mesurier and traveled with him to a White Helmets training exercise at a secret location in Turkey in 2016. "Why a secret location?" I asked. "Security," he replied. "Do you know how many people want us dead?"
I watched former vegetable sellers, teachers and scuba diving instructors learn how to dig for babies under concrete slabs and put out fires. At night, I listened to them tell stories, play music and prepare for a friend's wedding in Aleppo the following week.
They were weary and embattled. Aleppo fell a few weeks later, changing the tide of war for good. The United Nations stopped counting the dead. The peace process stalled. Syria came off the front pages.
The misery and the bombings did not stop. Mr. Le Mesurier continued working. He planned to bring the concept of the White Helmets to other war zones.
What saddens me most, aside from the loss of a good man, is that front-line humanitarian workers are protected by international law under the Geneva Conventions. But in Syria, no one is immune from death: not civilians, and not those helping to ease their misery.

Texto completo: When truth meets technology, it's not always clear who wins.
Longtime Washington Post reporter Dana Priest will speak Thursday night along with other prominent journalists at a two-day Santa Fe conference delving into how modern technology shapes facts at a time when social media algorithms can curate the news and Russian disinformation influences elections.
Priest and others will explore how social media, fake news and artificial intelligence form our understanding of the world at the second Journalism under Fire conference, hosted by the Santa Fe Council on International Relations.
The council's Executive Director Sandy Campbell said Priest and other speakers will dig into "the dark side and the light side of technology," with journalists from the Washington Post, National Public Radio, the New York Times and other outlets speaking about the intersection of press freedom, technology and democracy.
The conference welcomed participants Wednesday evening at La Fonda on the Plaza.
Campbell said the second iteration of the conference grew from discussions at last year's inaugural event, spurred a growing recognition of how new forms of advertising, plus social media giants such as Facebook and Google, can curate and shape people's core understanding of politics and reality.
Priest said she plans to discuss the increasing threat of disinformation, fake news and how social media affects the overall media landscape -- a fact often, and mistakenly, thought of as neutral.
The two-time Pulitzer Prize winner has covered the Pentagon, intelligence agencies, Russian disinformation campaigns and secret CIA prisons. She's the Knight Chair in Public Affairs Journalism at the University of Maryland's Merrill College of Journalism.
Priest said disinformation and fake news are new and increasingly alarming tools for an authoritarian government that are "less obvious, and so you can't fight it in the same way" as the more traditional tyrannical tactic of simply suppressing information.
Facebook and other social media algorithms also pose a major threat to the dissemination of legitimate news and information because the platforms prioritize content that spurs consumers to stay on the page as long as possible, Priest added.
"Fake news will always win over real news in the algorithms that are used in social media," she said. "What do you want to do: Eat your desert or eat your green beans? So it's not a neutral platform. They are making decisions for us. It's so much harder to counter because it's the business model baked into how Facebook and others operate."
Priest also criticized President Donald Trump's attacks on the media, a fact she said "is going to play out in a way that's unprecedented in the impeachment hearings."
Campbell said the Council on International Relations decided on journalism as a theme about two and a half years ago.
"Nobody else in the world is doing this kind of thing -- is putting the focus on journalism and journalists and the pressures they're operating under," he said.
The conference will run Thursday and Friday, with speakers that include New York Times Washington, D.C., correspondent Matthew Rosenberg; NPR Washington, D.C., national security correspondent Hannah Allam; former Time magazine managing editor Richard Stengel; former Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin; Washington Post columnist and investigative journalist Rana Ayyub and others.
Speakers will also dig into how China's use of technology will affect U.S. politics and how digital forensics have opened new lines of inquiry through crowd-sourced video and data.
"I think Santa Fe is becoming the mecca for press freedom not on the East Coast," Priest said. "I think everybody realizes even more that journalism is a strategic asset to democracy, not just a luxury or intellectual privilege or something. Especially when you have a White House that is trying to muzzle the press."

Texto completo: The life of Frank Giles, the British newspaper editor who died last week in London at the age of 100, was a striking combination of good and bad fortune.
The son of an Army officer who died when Giles was 10, his mother was obliged to take in lodgers to pay her son's school tuition. He won a scholarship to Oxford and was finishing his studies when World War II broke out. Giles, who suffered from poor health, seemed likely to be sidelined, until a family friend, a general who had been appointed governor of Bermuda, invited him to become his military assistant. Giles's good looks, smooth manner, and effortless competence served him well and brought him into contact with celebrities and VIPs passing forth between Britain and America.
He remembered afterward that Joseph Kennedy, the appeasement-minded U.S. ambassador in London, confided to Giles that "carnage" in Britain and France would compel "the warring nations [to] find a joint meeting ground and become united by a common demand for peace." Seeing the Duke of Windsor showering after a game of golf, Giles noted that he seemed to have no hair on his body, "even in places where one would most expect it to be." Toward the end of the war, he was transferred to the Foreign Office, where he served as assistant to two successive chiefs: Anthony Eden, the Tory grandee, and Ernest Bevin, the Labour foreign secretary. Giles resembled Eden in manner and appearance, but Bevin's contempt for left-wing intellectuals appealed to him almost as much as his humor. Standing side by side at two urinals, Bevin turned to his polished assistant and remarked, "This is it, Giles, the socialist dream: the means of production in the hands of the people."
Giles's official career, however, came to a halt in 1946, when he failed the Foreign Service entrance exam and found work as an editor on the foreign desk of the Times. He had never contemplated a career as a journalist but was tailored for success on postwar Fleet Street: Slightly to the left in politics, Giles was temperamentally conservative, unfailingly inquisitive, a skilled reporter in Paris and Rome, and, not least, happily married to the daughter of an earl and owner of a villa on Corfu.
In 1961, at the prompting of his friend and James Bond creator Ian Fleming, Giles joined the Sunday Times as foreign editor. He had hoped to become editor of the paper in 1967, but the post went to Harold Evans. In 1980, when Rupert Murdoch became proprietor of the Times newspapers, he moved Evans over to the Times as editor and appointed Giles to succeed Evans. In some respects, it was a natural choice: Giles was an enterprising editor and the Sunday Times was eminently suited to his talents. It would be difficult, however, to think of two more dissimilar figures, and in 1983, conflict between the mild-mannered Giles and the buccaneering Murdoch coincided with one of the great disasters of modern journalism: the Hitler Diaries hoax.

In fairness to both, the offer of West Germany's Stern newspaper to share its acquisition of 60 volumes of Hitler's journal, purportedly discovered in an East German hayloft, was accompanied by a measure of dissembling and deception. But the lure of the scoop was irresistible to Murdoch, and Giles's initial reservations were relieved when the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper inspected selections in a Swiss bank vault and judged them genuine. The subsequent fate of the "diaries" is well known: Trevor-Roper changed his mind and informed the editor of the Times but not Giles, the editor of the Sunday Times, where the diaries were initially published, and then swiftly retracted, with apologies.

Giles was subsequently dismissed by Murdoch, who, in 2012, declared the episode "a major mistake and one I shall have to live with for the rest of my life." It was Giles, however, whose New York Times obituary was headlined "Editor Snared in 'Hitler Diaries' Hoax," and whose life apart from that debacle was reduced to a handful of perfunctory paragraphs.

Texto completo: Huckleberries
The Coeur d'Alene Library Vigilante struck again this week. Remember? Someone is protesting what she or he believes to be a library bias against Trump and conservatives by hiding books critical of them.
On Tuesday, "shelvers" spotted a book by socialist Bernie Sanders inserted backward in the biography section. The censor figured that'd stop people from reading the tome. But the childish action now is exposed in a newspaper read by tens of thousands daily. In fact, the actions of this literary menace have been revealed worldwide.
The New York Times reported the story Sunday. Rick Reilly, author of "Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump," another book targeted by the censor, will speak at the Coeur d'Alene Library at 7 p.m. Nov. 21. And Librarian Bette Ammon is fielding calls from world media, including CNN, NPR and BBC.
The books targeted by the Library Vigilante are more popular than ever. And big donations are pouring into the Library Foundation. Will censors ever learn?
Love hurts
This is what love looks like in North Idaho.
Anna Heisey of Coeur d'Alene is shopping at Kohl's on Highway 95, when hubby, Darryl, sends a text.
"I am coming over!" messages the region's vets' director for the state of Idaho.
They meet among the winter coats. He gives her a hug and a kiss.
Anna: "So what's going on?" Darryl, in full flirt mode: "Nothing. I just wanted to spend time with my wife."
As the cockles of her heart warm, Anna hugs Darryl back.
Then, Darryl lowers his voice and glances around. Anna hangs on his words: "I need you to help me pick up a roadkill! It's still fresh! I know it!"
And there goes that warm glow.
Huckleberries
Poet's Corner: This month turkeys/are selected:/some get stuffed and/some elected - Tom Wobker, The Bard of Sherman Avenue ("November Ritual")  What was worrying our pretty little heads 50 years ago? Daylight Saving Time. Idaho legislators were pushing a straw poll to decide whether it was time to end the split into two time zones. Fast forward to today - and the Salmon River remains the dividing line for the Spud State's two time zones. Progress?  Bumpersnicker (with outline of the state of Idaho): "Californians  the new invasive species"  The Kellogg PD has a message for that hit-and-run driver who left his pickup canopy behind. The department would love to give it back: "Just swing by the PD and pick it up," writes Sgt. Paul Twidt of the Roll Call report. "We have some paperwork for you as well."
Parting shot
A reader named Barbara emails about Huckleberries' close encounter with an open-carry customer at a Hayden credit union.
Barbara, by the way, keeps guns at home and hunted as a younger woman. She has no problem with Inland Northwesterners who conceal carry to protect themselves. But she considers open carry to be an aggressive act. Barbara leaves restaurants and other enclosed places when she sees someone open carrying.
"It signals lots of uncomfortable possibilities," she emails. "What is going to happen if this person hears a loud noise? If this person is emotionally unstable, am I going to get caught in the crossfire when they react? Are they trained and stable?" Inquiring minds want to know.

Spokane libraries book-avenger free
Just across the state border, the Spokane County Library District hasn't faced the issues that have put national media attention on Coeur d'Alene. The district consists of 11 full-service libraries throughout Spokane County.
Occasionally, library patrons will complain about a title or two, usually because it provides the opposite viewpoint of that person, according to Jane Baker, the district's communication & development director.
"That means we're doing our job as a library, making sure we have balanced opinions," Baker said.
The Spokane Public Library, which serves the city of Spokane, did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday.

Texto completo: The coveted Cortaca Jug will boldly go where it has never gone before.
Neither Jim Butterfield Stadium nor SUNY Cortland Stadium will host the annual game between Ithaca College and SUNY Cortland this season.
The Division III football rivals with campuses about 20 miles apart in central New York are hitting the road this year to play at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Kickoff is 1 p.m. Saturday.
Here are 10 things to know about the Cortaca Jug:
It'll be a record The largest crowd to see a Division III football game is 37,355. That happened Sept. 23, 2017, when Minnesota rivals St. Thomas and St. John's played at Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins.
As of about two weeks ago, more than 42,500 tickets had been sold for the Cortaca Jug, Ithaca College Athletic Director Susan Bassett said.
"We've probably expanded a lot of peoples' imagination at this point," Bassett said. "For Division III to have this kind of showcase and this type of interest, everyone thinks it's all about professional sports and Division I sports, but this really sets the bar for interest in Division III athletics."
Doing the math Ithaca and Cortland have been playing for the Jug since 1959, with the Bombers holding a 37-24 lead in Jug games.
But their first football game came in 1930, a 12-0 Cortland victory.
They played 16 times before the first Cortaca Jug. Ithaca leads the overall series, 41-33-3.
The teams played twice in 1988, the Red Dragons winning the Cortaca Jug game, 21-20. Three weeks later they met in an NCAA quarterfinal and the Bombers won, 24-17.
It's more than football Ithaca will be sending 16 buses to New Jersey, many carrying student spectators as well as others who participate in the event.
The Bombers' choir will sing the national anthem, cheer teams will accompany both teams, Ithaca's West African Drumming and Dance Ensemble will perform and students from IC's school of sports management will organize pre-game events
"It's beyond this being a football game," Bassett said. "There are multiple ways people are involved. It's multi-faceted and comprehensive."
Media interest Cortland AD Mike Urtz said he's done interviews with the New York Times and Forbes Magazine in the lead up to the game.
"Our campus is getting unbelievable exposure," he said. "This is probably my fourth interview. When you look at the free marketing and free branding for both institutions, it's been incredible."
Local talent Ithaca is in Section 4 boundaries and Cortland is just outside, and both teams' rosters include players from nearby.
The Bombers' top receiving threat is Owego graduate Will Gladney, a senior who leads the team with 60 receptions, 811 yards and 12 touchdowns.
On the defensive side, Greene graduate John Hadac, a senior lineman, has a team-best 61/2 sacks among his 41 tackles and one forced fumble.
Junior defensive back Khiry Brown, an Ithaca High graduate, has 28 tackles, two interceptions and five pass break-ups.
For Cortland, senior linebacker Dylan Studer, a Chenango Forks graduate, has 21 tackles.
Others from Section 4 are freshman quarterback Joe Mack (Dryden), sophomore linebacker Trey Floyd (Tioga), freshman offensive lineman Dylan Houseknecht (Odessa-Montour), sophomore offensive lineman Daquan Griffin (Ithaca) and junior receiver Ky'Sawn Veale (Norwich).
Cortland's head coach is Dan MacNeill, a Walton graduate.
Downstate interest Bassett and Urtz said a major reason ticket sales have been so brisk is the large number of downstate graduates from both schools.
"The alumni gatherings to watch the game down in the city, they were getting larger and larger," Urtz said. "Within the last two years, there were two bar/restaurants in New York City somewhere, one of them hosted Cortland and the other hosted Ithaca and they were across the street and they each had more than 1,000 people just to watch the game. I knew we were going to have a pretty good draw."
Tickets They're still available, plenty of them. If you're looking to go and you're a fan of perusing online ticket sites such as stubhub or ticketmaster, you can find tickets for as low as $20 or as expensive as $500.
Might happen again Bassett said given the interest this year's game has drawn, she wouldn't be surprised if the Cortaca Jug returned to the NYC area in the future.
"We look at this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Bassett said. "At some point is it possible our campus leadership would say, 'Let's do this every four years and we'll alternate who the host team is.' I just have no idea. We haven't gotten that far yet. We're so focused on this experience.
"If you had a couple years to plan, I think this would be so much easier for everybody, but this is all coming together nicely."
What can you bring If you're heading to the game, here's what you can bring:
Clear bags that are 12-by-6-by-12 inches or less in size (one bag per person); small purses/handbags (clutch-type bags) that are 41/2-by-61/2 or less in size (one per person); food of any kind that is contained in a clear plastic bag; plastic bottles of water or soft drinks that are 20 ounces or less; cameras with a lens that is 6 inches or less in length; jackets, blankets or other items, which will be patted down or searched; official national flags that can reasonably be hand held by a single person.
What can't you bring Don't bring these items:
Seat cushions of any size except those for medical needs; glass bottles, cans, coolers of any kind, thermoses or ice chests; alcohol of any kind; banners of any size; flags that are not the official flag of a country; umbrellas, strollers, laser pointers and balls of any kind; video cameras or still photography cameras with a lens longer than six inches; selfie sticks; weapons or any item that may be used as a projectile or one that is deemed dangerous by stadium management; any animal aside from service animals; any item deemed inappropriate by stadium management.

'FANTASTIC FUNGI' FORECASTS AN EXPANDED ROLE IN HUMAN EVOLUTION

Texto completo: The newly released film "Fantastic Fungi" is a paean to a botanical kingdom that includes one of the most popular pizza toppings in the U.S. and some of the most delectable ingredients of gourmet dishes, but also yeasts, molds, mildews and smuts.
Award-winning cinematographer Louie Schwartzberg celebrates the diversity and wonder of the ubiquitous lifeforms (neither animal nor plant) from familiar applications in diet and medicine to the proposition that they may provide a model for reunifying a disconnected world.
The 81-minute long film will be screened 10 times this month, beginning Thursday, at the Carnegie Science Center.
Mr. Schwartzberg has worked in the film industry for more than 40 years, including with National Geographic and Walt Disney Studios, and pioneered time-lapse photography.
Enchanting sequences show mushroom nubs breaking through soil, stretching up on elongating stems and finally opening into their classic umbrella shapes in condensed real time. CGI takes viewers into underground realms and to the expansive universe of psychedelic experience.
Interviews with specialists from a variety of professions contribute a range of perspectives on fungi, from their use in mental health treatment to the clean up of oil spills.
Included are prominent names like author Michael Pollan, whose books include New York Times bestsellers "The Omnivore's Dilemma" and "The Botany of Desire"; Dr. Andrew Weil, a global figure in the field of integrative medicine; and food journalist Eugenia Bone, co-author with her father, chef Edward Giobbi, of "Italian Family Dining."
Featured is author Paul Stamets, a self-taught mycologist who has received awards and recognition from several prominent mycological associations. He's discovered and named several new species of psilocybin mushrooms (the 1960s hallucinogenic) and is a preservationist of mushroom ancestral strains found in pristine woodlands.
Mr. Stamets is founder/owner of Fungi Perfecta, a supplement and research company in Olympia, Wa. The Science Officer on the CBS series "Star Trek: Discovery" is named after him.
Research on medical uses of fungi is becoming more mainstream including the recently established Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins University, the first such formal center in the U.S.
Central to the film are mycelia, the somewhat mysterious subterranean filamentous networks that distribute nutrients among ecosystems and replenish soil. Mushrooms are its fruiting body in the way an apple is to its tree.
Director Schwartzberg compares that inter-cellular network to the worldwide web and feels it has something to teach us about sharing and sustainability. But that's a reduced summation of a complex concept that encompasses a paradigm shift in the way our civilization is evolving.
He hopes the film will open people's hearts and have a positive effect on the planet, almost like a Woodstock of the early 2000s.
"When you sense the oneness you are with us," says the disembodied voice of the mushrooms delivered by Academy Award-winning actress Brie Larson.
"Beauty is nature's tool for survival - we protect what we love," Mr. Schwartzberg writes in a press release. "that is the shift in consciousness we need to sustain and celebrate life."
"Fantastic Fungi" will be shown in the Rangos Giant Cinema at 5 and 7 p.m. Thursday, Friday Nov. 14, 15 and Nov. 20; 1:15 and 7 p.m. Saturday Nov. 16; 1:15 p.m. Sunday Nov. 17 and 5 p.m. Nov. 21. Tickets, $9.95 (members $7.95), may be purchased at www.carnegiesciencecenter.org.

Ex-Governor Set to Enter Crowded Race For President

Texto completo: Mr. Patrick, the former two-term governor of Massachusetts, called several leading Democrats and allies to say that he would announce his bid for the White House.
NEW ORLEANS -- Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts told senior Democrats Wednesday that he will enter the presidential race, according to two party officials, reversing his decision last year to forgo a run and adding yet more volatility to an unusually fluid Democratic primary.

Mr. Patrick will enter the race Thursday morning and head to New Hampshire's State House to file paperwork to be a candidate on the primary ballot there, according to a Democrat familiar with his plans. Mr. Patrick was calling a list of party leaders Wednesday to inform them of his decision and is planning to begin his campaign with a video and new website.
After appearing in New Hampshire, Mr. Patrick will head to California, which is voting in early March, and then go on to three early nominating states: Nevada, Iowa and South Carolina.
Joining the campaign less than three months before the first votes are cast in Iowa, at a moment when candidates are usually dropping out and not jumping in, Mr. Patrick will face long odds. Yet his decision to run reflects the fractured nature of the Democratic race at a moment when Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, has also taken steps to enter the primary.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proved more durable than dominant, at or near the top in polls of most early-nominating states, but unable to seize control of the race against unexpected moderate alternatives such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. And the two leading progressives, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have shown fund-raising strength but have not yet broadened their appeal enough to emerge as consensus candidates.
In his conversations with Democrats this week, Mr. Patrick acknowledged the scale of the challenge he faces by getting in this late. But he has received encouragement from some in the party who believe the race remains unsettled -- and that he could prove a formidable candidate.
Mr. Patrick hopes to bridge the divisions that have shaped the contest so far, appealing to centrists and liberals, white and nonwhite voters and across generational and economic lines in a way none of the candidates have been able to do. A close friend of former President Barack Obama, he has told advisers that he envisions a campaign similar to Mr. Obama's 2008 bid, focusing more on bringing people together and healing the country than making a particular ideological case.
Mr. Patrick traveled to some early nominating states in 2018 before deciding against a campaign this time last year. While he said then that his decision owed in part to the "cruelty of our elections process," as he put it, his wife, Diane, had also recently been given a cancer diagnosis. She is now healthy.
Mr. Patrick is planning to focus much of his attention on New Hampshire, where he is known by some voters for serving two terms as governor, from 2007 to 2015, across the state line. And as the second elected black governor in the country's history, he is hoping for a strong showing in South Carolina, where African-American voters will make up over half the primary electorate.

But Mr. Patrick has told Democrats that, unlike what Mr. Bloomberg is planning, he will not fully skip any of the early nominating states.

His task won't be easy. Mr. Patrick enters the race with little organization, no campaign cash and an imperative to gather both as he also tries to appeal to voters in a contest where Super Tuesday takes place in early March, immediately after the first four nominating states. It's also unclear when, or if, he'll qualify for a debate.
He has missed the filing deadlines in two states, Alabama and Arkansas, so he begins at a disadvantage should the primary evolve into a marathon where every delegate is crucial. And he's already started to draw fire from liberal critics for his current post at Bain Capital, the private equity firm that Senator Mitt Romney of Utah co-founded and led, and that Democrats assailed Mr. Romney for when he ran for president in 2012.
There is also the more fundamental question of whether there's even an opening for a new candidate. Polls of Democratic voters indicate that they're mostly satisfied with what's still an unusually large field of contenders.
Yet while even Mr. Patrick's most ardent admirers allow that he faces long odds, they believe that the splintered nature of the race calls out for an upbeat and consensus-oriented candidate.
"If anybody is capable of catching lightning in a bottle, it's him," said Tim Murray, a former mayor of Worcester, Mass., who served as Mr. Patrick's lieutenant governor.

Texto completo: When Kelly McBride joined ESPN as an ombudsman in 2011, the sports media giant was wrestling with what to do about commercial sponsorships for some of its television personalities, she said. Of course some of the former athletes the network employed were going to get " and take " sponsorship offers. But some of ESPN's reporters had significant followings. They wanted a piece of endorsement deals, too.
That presented a problem that ESPN continues to wrestle with today, media analysts say. As media companies consolidate even further, disparate properties now may have at least one thing in common: corporate ownership.
'This is what's going to happen as media companies become larger and larger,' McBride, a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism organization, said in a phone interview. 'We're in this era where you can't just exist as a successful media company. You have to continue to grow and get bigger and bigger, and you see all media companies doing it.'
The Walt Disney Company, which owns ESPN, launched subscription streaming platform Disney Plus on Tuesday. The service, which costs $6.99 per month, includes original content from Disney, Marvel, National Geographic and Pixar, along with archival programming from each.
'It will change lives,' ESPN Senior NFL Insider Adam Schefter tweeted, along with a promotional video that did not include any ESPN content.
'Access to a huge cache of incredible content, new and old,' NFL reporter Ed Werder posted.
That rankled some sports media analysts, who saw ESPN personalities marketing the service on Twitter.

An ESPN spokesman said in an emailed statement that the network never told employees to share promotional material about Disney Plus but actively told them about the new streaming service, which is meant to play a fundamental part in Disney's future.

To Bob Lipsyte, another former ESPN ombudsman and retired New York Times sportswriter, that makes sense. Reporters market their content all the time, he said, and consumers can bundle subscriptions to Disney Plus, sports streaming service ESPN Plus and Hulu. But ESPN, he said, for all the talented reporters at the network, doesn't behave like a typical newspaper or news network. And he wondered about the stakes of the Disney plugs. The kind of personalities who marketed Disney Plus, though they might have large social media followings, aren't covering Congress or climate change.
'It's hardly any kind of important news that we are so concerned about the high level of integrity of the purveyor of this news,' he said.

Texto completo: Since opening Parkway Pizza off Metro Parkway in south Fort Myers in May, Brandee Newcomer has been giving her arms a workout.
The Pennsylvania native, who moved to Florida with her husband five years ago, hand-tosses the pizzas she serves.
And it's hard work.
"We had a fundraiser the other week, and just for that order we had 29 pizzas," Newcomer said.
"Our arms were tired after that."
Newcomer has worked in restaurants her whole life, but Parkway Pizza is the first one she's owned. Among her family and friends, she's famous for her baked goods — pies, cookies, truffles.
"We were actually looking for a bakery and then the pizzeria came up," she said.
"So, we decided to give that a shot."
Despite knowing little about pizza, Newcomer proved to be a natural at it. She developed her own recipes and learned the nuances of tossing dough from Parkway's Cheney Brothers representative. Now, Newcomer's pizzeria draws lunch customers from the surrounding Metro Parkway area and families who want to stop in for a hearty meal.
Newcomer is known for her generosity. She loads her pizzas up with extra toppings, which make them a huge hit. Customers love the Carnivore Lover pizza, which comes with pepperoni, sausage, ham, bacon and meatballs. Parkway's Supreme with pepperoni, sausage, ham, mushrooms, onions, olives and green peppers is another favorite, as is the classic Margherita.
The shop also serves salads, subs, cheesesteaks, strombolis and calzones, plus breakfast sandwiches that are available all day. For customers with a sweet tooth, Newcomer has special treat — her homemade cookies.
"Big Ass Cookies is what we call them," she said.
"You got to have some fun, right?"
She's thinking of adding pumpkin whoopie pies to her lineup for the fall.
"They're a Pennsylvania Dutch thing," she said. "They're huge up north."
Like many first-time restaurant owners, Newcomer is finding that having her own place is a ton of work — but totally worth it.
"It's very rewarding and exhausting all at the same time," she said.
"I really enjoy interacting with the customers. I know a lot of their names, and they'll talk to me for five to 10 minutes while I'm making their pizza."
The pizzeria is busiest between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., when people from the nearby business and industrial parks come through for lunch. But Newcomer sees plenty of couples with children, as well.
"A lot of customers say it feels like family when they come in. We interact with them — it's not just throwing food at them and getting them out the door," Newcomer said.
"I think that's important. Everybody likes to go where people know your name."

Woman Named Top Editor At Financial Times, a First In the Paper's Long History

Texto completo: For the first time in its long history, The Financial Times will be led by a woman.
On Tuesday, the daily known for its robust coverage of international markets, its distinctive salmon-hued paper and its impenetrable digital paywall, announced that Roula Khalaf will be its top editor, starting in January. Ms. Khalaf, a 24-year veteran of the newspaper, which has its headquarters in London, will succeed Lionel Barber, a Financial Times journalist since the 1980s and its editor since 2005.
Mr. Barber, 64, said in an interview Tuesday that he had consulted with the newspaper's owners about a transition for more than a year. "You mustn't see this as some kind of 'woke' gesture -- it's got nothing to do with that," he said. "She is one of our most outstanding journalists. She's been deputy editor for four years, she's been tested in all sorts of areas, and that's why she's the next editor."
The newspaper, which was founded in 1888 and has a paid circulation of one million, including digital and print subscribers, declined to make Ms. Khalaf available for an interview. In a statement on Tuesday, she said, "It's a great honor to be appointed editor of The FT, the greatest news organization in the world."
Born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, and educated in the United States at Syracuse University and Columbia University, Ms. Khalaf has served as the publication's Middle East editor, foreign editor and deputy editor. Before joining The Financial Times, she wrote for Forbes magazine, where she made waves with a feature article on Jordan Belfort, the shady stockbroker who became known as the wolf in Martin Scorsese's 2013 film, "The Wolf of Wall Street." A character based on Ms. Khalaf appears in the movie.
Ms. Khalaf returned to the subject of Mr. Belfort in a 2014 Financial Times article, writing, "I am the journalist who in the movie wrote the 1991 'hatchet job' on Mr. Belfort and his respectably named but disreputable Stratton Oakmont outfit. My character -- I was a Forbes reporter when I wrote the profile -- gets a few seconds' play, followed by a scene in which Mr. Belfort is infuriated by my story. I had described him as sounding like a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers. That was rather charitable since he was also probably fleecing widows and orphans."
During his 14-year tenure as top editor, Mr. Barber guided the newspaper through a decline in the industry, as well as its sale four years ago from Pearson, the British media company, to Nikkei, the Japanese financial news publisher, for $ 1.3 billion.
He noted that he had traveled in the Middle East with Ms. Khalaf, interviewing the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, in 2013 and, in 2015, visiting Mohammed bin Salman, then Saudi Arabia's deputy crown prince.
Mr. Barber's legacy will include presiding over the newspaper as it reoriented its business model to be focused on circulation revenue -- subscribers paying for access. Many legacy media news organizations, including The New York Times, have made this move in recent years. The Financial Times was among the pioneers, instituting an online paywall as early as 2007.
"We said, 'We're going to charge for content,"' Mr. Barber said. "By saying that, and also raising prices, that was a message to the outside market that we're worth it. But it was also an incredibly powerful message to the newsroom: 'Now we're really going to have to be the very best."'

Student journalists erred. Don’t berate them for it.

Texto completo: Journalists " the good ones, at least " are always walking the line between unsparing truth-telling and sensitivity to those affected by their work.
Students who run the Daily Northwestern stumbled this week as they walked that line.
The top editors of the student newspaper did something incomprehensible to many professional journalists.
They abjectly apologized, in writing, for doing some of the most basic jobs of journalism: Documenting a protest (in this case, an appearance by former attorney general Jeff Sessions on campus) and seeking comment by using a campus directory to contact students via text message.
And in making that apology " in a published statement " they used some language that played into the idea that today's students are too sensitive to live in the real world. In the vernacular: 'snowflakes.'
'Some protesters found photos posted to reporters' Twitter accounts retraumatizing and invasive,' the statement said, explaining that they'd since been removed. And contacting students via text was an invasion of privacy.
But what the student journalists did is nothing to apologize for. They told what happened in photographs and words. They went the extra mile to reach people for comment.
After the apology and explanation published, professional journalists couldn't believe what they were seeing, especially because Northwestern boasts a premier journalism school, Medill.
Many in the Twitterverse of verified users " rife with journalists " unloaded on the students.
'Namby-pamby is the phrase I've been looking for,' Alex Keefe, an editor at WBEZ in Chicago, wrote in a since-deleted tweet.
'As a @medillschool alum, a journalist, a journalism educator and a . . . First Amendment advocate, this editorial stuns me,' tweeted David Boardman, dean of the Temple University media school and the former editor of the Seattle Times.
Others said they thought they were reading the Onion, a parody website.
What could possibly be wrong with taking and posting photographs and texting students to ask whether they were willing to be interviewed?
But then a more nuanced view took hold, especially among women and people of color who understood the issues differently.
Astead Herndon, national political reporter at the New York Times, provided some insight: This generation of journalists, he wrote, have an instinct 'to care about historically marginalized communities and rethink power dynamics and it is playing out in a raw and uninformed way.'
In this case, those dynamics have to do with race, because many of the protesters (of the Sessions appearance and the coverage) were students of color.
So too is the Daily's top editor, Troy Closson, who said in a Twitter thread that he had been struggling to meet conflicting demands " and, he admitted, he hadn't done it perfectly.
'Being in this role and balancing our coverage and the role of this paper on campus with my racial identity " and knowing how our paper has historically failed students of color, and particularly black students, has been incredibly challenging to navigate,' he wrote.
Then he said that he appreciated the response he'd received (some of it pretty vicious) and that he had learned from it.
Under tremendous pressure and criticism, Closson exhibited a kind of grace and equanimity that (as a Medill alumna and a former student journalist myself) I found admirable.
Closson admitted that in hindsight, parts of the editors' statement went too far.
And he reiterated that he and his colleagues fully understand the role of journalism: 'We covered the protest to its full extent and stand by our reporting.'
The Daily's reporting included accounts of Sessions harshly criticizing protesters:
' 'I'm just going to tell you, this is stupid,' Sessions remarked as students pounded on the door to the auditorium and recited phrases like . . . 'You are a racist, you put kids in cages.' '
Notably, Closson referred to having 'over-corrected' in parts of the editors' statement.
Which " given that he and his colleagues are students " seems easily forgivable.
Then Closson did what good leaders do: He made it clear that the buck stopped with him.
'I hope in providing critiques and feedback of our statement, you can direct that toward me. The other staff members whose names are on it don't have the final say. I do. I can live with the consequences of that, but they shouldn't have to.'
The journalists at the Daily Northwestern seem interested in learning something from all of what happened, including their mistakes.
Which is, after all, what being a student is all about.

Texto completo: La compañía Tribune Publishing anunció este martes el cierre del periódico Hoy, que servía a la comunidad hispanohablante del área de Chicago.
El semanario dejará de circular el 13 de diciembre. También se acabará su sitio web.
El periódico fue lanzado en 2003 como reemplazo del semanario Éxito y fue diario por varios años. En 2017 pasó a ser semanario después de un par de años circulando tres días a la semana. Actualmente operaba con cerca de media docena de empleados.
Relacionado: Suspenden operación del New York Times en Español
La publicación era la última de la marca Hoy que quedaba en funcionamiento. Hoy nació en Nueva York en 1998, y se expandió a Chicago y Los Ángeles al ser adquirido por Tribune Co. en 2000 .
Impremedia, propietaria de El Diario y La Opinión, adquirió Hoy Nueva York en 2007, cuando era un diario de distribución gratuita. El medio cerró en 2009.
En agosto pasado, el semanario Hoy Los Ángeles fue cerrado por Los Angeles Times para dar paso a Los Angeles Times en Español, que solamente opera de manera digital.
Tribune Publishing ofreció a los empleados de Hoy Chicago vincularse a plazas abiertas en el Chicago Tribune.
El sindicato del Chicago Tribune lamentó el cierre de Hoy.
“Estamos profundamente decepcionados de que Tribune Publishing esté cerrando Hoy, que ha ido más allá de los estereotipos y ha proporcionado noticias significativas al vasto cuerpo de hispanohablantes en nuestra región. Esto es perjudicial para nuestros periodistas, nuestros lectores y nuestra empresa”, escribió el sindicato en su cuenta de Twitter.
We're deeply disappointed that Tribune Publishing is shutting down Hoy, which has gone beyond stereotypes and provided meaningful news to the vast body of Spanish-speakers in our region. This is a disservice to our journalists, our readers and our company.

Texto completo: One winter afternoon, as we stood at the corner waiting to cross the street, my friend turned to me and said he wished he'd get run over by a car. It would make everything he worried about go away.
It was 2017, less than a month into the new Trump administration, yet it had already signed executive orders to increase border security, empower ruthless Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and ban millions of people in Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States.
Immigrant families, and especially undocumented immigrants like my friend, were suddenly living with more fear and uncertainty than ever.
Things have hardly gotten any better since then. More than 5,400 children have been separated from their families at the U. S. -Mexico border since July 2017. And every day seems to bring out heartbreaking stories of people who’ve lived here for years or decades being torn from their families and communities.
Trump even tried to terminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which protects nearly 700,000 people from deportation. Only the courts and the collective power of undocumented organizers have delayed him — and even that could change if the Supreme Court upholds the administration's efforts to kill the program. The court hears oral arguments on the efforts to end the program Tuesday.
Each day triggers flight-or-fight
Imagine running away from a lion all your life — that's how an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States feel today. And as my friend’s agony shows, it takes a toll.
Biologically speaking, the fight-or-flight response in your nervous system doesn’t distinguish a lion from an ICE agent — it will turn on regardless of who the perceived predator is. Living in constant fight-or-flight mode can lead to high blood pressure and contribute to anxiety, depression and addiction.
Congress must enforce immigration law: My son was murdered by an illegal immigrant. Neither he nor Mollie Tibbetts deserved to die.
As Karla Cornejo Villavicencio put it in a column for The New York Times: “Undocumented life in America is hard on the mind and body. ” And the stories proving it are piling up.
A 21-year-old DACA recipient who spoke anonymously to Vice said she lies awake until 5 a. m. worrying about her family being separated. She said she had put on weight from stress-eating and even developed pneumonia. She’s hardly alone. “A recent study of Latinas in the Salinas Valley, California, published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine,” Vice noted, “found an association between worrying about deportation and multiple risk factors for heart disease. ”
The effects are even worse for those unlucky enough to experience immigration detention.
A recent report by Congress' bipartisan Commission on Civil Rights warned the Trump administration that the severe trauma caused by the incarceration of children and families, the separation of children from their parents, unsanitary conditions in detention facilities, and inhumane practices like solitary confinement are all proven to increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression in the immigrants who face these challenges.
Immigration enforcement authorities aren’t the only source of stress, either.
Not detained, but still under pressure
As part of the New Mexico Dream Team, an immigrant rights group, I co-authored two reports discussing how both educational and health care institutions come with barriers that can contribute to the mental health crises immigrants experience.
According to a Department of Education report published in 2015, approximately 65,000 undocumented students graduate from U. S. high schools every year, and only 5-10% of those students pursue higher education.
In our interviews with more than a dozen people in our state who identified as undocumented, DACA-mented, or who belong to a mixed immigration status family, we found that racial microaggressions, discriminatory practices by school administrators and concern over how to afford higher education (especially without scholarships or help navigating the system) increased their mental health stress
My life is more than a bargaining chip: I nearly lost my job because of Trump's turn on DACA. 'Dreamers' can't keep living in limbo.
When it comes to health care, our interviews found that those who are undocumented, DACA-mented, or belong to a mixed immigration status family faced a different sort of “wall” blocking the care they needed — a lack of access to health insurance and a fear of exposing their immigration status to hospitals.
This mirrors national trends. Doctors report that often, undocumented patients admitted to the hospital fear revealing too much identifiable information. And according to a 2017 report by The Kaiser Family Foundation, 41% of undocumented immigrants are uninsured and are ineligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
New Mexico is a relatively immigrant-friendly state. I shudder to think of what it’s like for people in more hostile states.
Wherever undocumented families turn, they face the risk of severe damage to their overall well-being. That’s why anti-immigrant policies — and predatory agencies like ICE and Customs and Border Protection — need to be treated like the public health issue they are.
Thankfully, community-based health clinics and undocumented-led grassroots initiatives like the New Mexico Dream Team’s UndocuHealth program are serving undocumented youth, who are unable to access more formal mental health services because of their status, through natural and indigenous healing techniques. But there’s only so much they can do on their own.
Living in constant fear of deportation isn’t a life anyone deserves. What we actually need is for Congress to eradicate the virus causing all this despair — by abolishing the systems and structures that allow undocumented families and individuals to be persecuted in the first place.

Texto completo: Roberts has been pivotal in past battles about administration policy
The Supreme Court on Tuesday will once again review a controversial policy initiated by President Trump and blocked by lower courts, this time ahead of an election year and with the fate of nearly 700,000 'dreamers' brought to the United States as undocumented children hanging on the outcome.
The Trump administration has tried for more than two years to 'wind down' the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, announced by President Barack Obama in 2012 to protect from deportation qualified young immigrants who came to the country illegally.
Individual DACA recipients, giant corporations, civil rights groups and universities have challenged the administration's plans, and won. Lower courts have found that the administration relied on faulty legal analysis for ending the program, rather than providing lawful reasons that the courts and the public could evaluate.
Nearly 800,000 people over the years have participated in the program, which provides a chance for enrollees to work legally in the United States as long as they follow the rules and have a clean record. More than 90-percent of DACA recipients are employed and 45-percent are in school, according to one government study.
Dozens of briefs have been filed in what will be one of the court's marquee cases of the term, many of them only tangentially addressing the legal issues at play. Instead, they extol the doctors, lawyers, engineers, students and military officers whose accomplishments were made possible by the program.
Microsoft, which employs more than 60 DACA recipients, is a party to one of the lawsuits, and the tech giant's president, Brad Smith, wrote in a recent blog post that 'we represent employers of all sizes in making the case to uphold DACA.'
More than 140 companies filed a brief to show what Smith said was the 'serious harm that would be inflicted on the economy if we were to lose the contributions of Dreamers.'
Even Trump has said that he considers DACA recipients hard-working and sympathetic, many of them thriving in the only country they have ever known. He said in a tweet last fall: 'Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!'
But Congress and the White House have been unable for years to come up with a permanent solution. Obama set up the program after negotiations over a comprehensive immigration reform plan failed. Democrats passed another measure to protect DACA recipients, but Trump and Republicans wanted a more extensive deal that would include the president's plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Most recently, Trump has said that a Supreme Court ruling in favor of his administration is necessary to bring Democrats back to the table.
'Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!' he tweeted in September.
The common thread in the Supreme Court showdowns over Trump's authority has been the president making good on campaign pledges to tighten the nation's borders and crack down on those in the United States illegally.
The justices ended their most recent term in June by stopping the administration's plan to put a citizenship question on the 2020 Census. Even census experts said such a question was likely to deter noncitizens from returning the forms and impede an accurate population count.
The court ended its 2018 term by approving the president's travel ban on visitors from a handful of mostly Muslim countries.
The only justice in the majority in both cases was Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who also wrote both opinions. He will be the most closely watched justice when the court takes up the DACA case Tuesday.
In a sense, the DACA case combines the issues in the previous two.
Roberts, joined by the court's most consistent conservatives, wrote in the travel ban decision that Congress has given the president 'broad discretion' in immigration matters and that Trump was lawfully using it to protect the country.
In the census decision, the court's four liberals joined Roberts in his view that courts have a role in defining limits to that deference.
Agencies must offer 'genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public,' Roberts wrote. 'Accepting contrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.'
In the DACA case, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said in a brief to the Supreme Court that the judiciary has no authority to keep the administration from revoking 'a discretionary policy of nonenforcement that is sanctioning an ongoing violation of federal immigration law by nearly 700,000 aliens.'
He added: 'At best, DACA is legally questionable; at worst, it is illegal.'
It might seem logical that a program implemented by one president, Obama, could be rescinded by another, Trump. But California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D), who is leading one of the lawsuits against DACA's revocation, said that the administration's argument ignores an important difference.
'President Obama followed the law to put it in place,' Becerra said in interview. 'Donald Trump did it the Donald Trump way. You can't change the law by breaking the law.'
The Trump administration moved to scuttle the program in 2017 after Texas and other states threatened to sue to force its end. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised the Department of Homeland Security that the program was probably unlawful and that it could not be defended.
Sessions based that decision on a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which said that another Obama program protecting immigrants was beyond the president's constitutional powers. The Supreme Court deadlocked 4 to 4 in 2016 when considering the issue.
In their book 'Border Wars: Inside Trump's Assault on Immigration,' New York Times reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear describe tense White House meetings between immigration hard-liners such as Sessions and Trump aide Stephen Miller on one side, and others such as Elaine C. Duke, then the acting homeland security secretary, on the other.
Duke relented under pressure, the authors said, but refused to cite policy objections in her short memo saying the administration was winding down the program. Instead, she relied solely on the fact that Sessions had said the program was unlawful.
That has put the Trump administration in an unusual position. Instead of arguing broad executive power over immigration, as it and other administrations have in the past, it has said the program was halted because it was probably unconstitutional.
Washington lawyer Andrew Pincus, who wrote an amicus brief on behalf of DACA recipients, said in a blog post that 'such a 'law made us do it' rationale let the President avoid political accountability for ending an extremely popular program.'
It has proven unpersuasive to the lower courts, which have said the administration must provide other reasons.
That was at the heart of the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.
'To be clear: we do not hold that DACA could not be rescinded as an exercise of Executive Branch discretion,' Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote. 'We hold only that here, where the Executive did not make a discretionary choice to end DACA " but rather acted based on an erroneous view of what the law required " the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under settled law.'
Theodore B. Olsen, a solicitor general under President George W. Bush who will be one of two lawyers arguing against DACA's rescission, suggested that the Trump administration's justification falls short of what Roberts demanded in the census case.
'An administration may impose new or different priorities, but only if it adheres to [legal] requirements and clearly states its policy choices so that it can be held publicly accountable for them,' Olson wrote.
'The judiciary, in turn, has a limited but essential role: ensuring that the executive considers and clearly explains the consequences of new approaches, especially for those who will be profoundly affected by a change.'
The consolidated cases the court will hear Tuesday are Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California , Trump v. NAACP and McAleenan v. Vidal.

Trump and ambition corrupted Haley

Texto completo: Nikki Haley used to be known as the other member of President Trump's Cabinet who left with an intact reputation (in addition to former defense secretary Jim Mattis). In an administration more influenced by Recep Tayyip Erdogan than Ronald Reagan, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations often provided a more traditional rhetorical take on American foreign policy. Haley seemed genuinely to care about human rights and democracy, and to somehow get away with displaying such caring in public. Her confidence in national principles marked her as such a freakish exception that some speculated she might be the rogue, anti-Trump Trump official who wrote an anonymous op-ed in the New York Times.
But Trump's corruption still pulls at a distance. Clearly convinced that Trumpism is here to stay, Haley has publicly turned against other officials in the administration who saw the president as a dangerous fool. She recounts an hour-long meeting with then-Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who 'confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country.' The conspirators (in Haley's telling) considered it a life-and-death matter. 'This was how high the stakes were, he and Kelly told me. We are doing the best we can do to save the country, they said. We need you to work with us and help us do it.'
Haley, by her own account, refused to help. 'Instead of saying that to me, they should've been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan,' she now explains. 'It should've been, 'Go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don't like what he's doing.' But to undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing.'
Here Haley is confusing two categories. If a Cabinet member has a policy objection of sufficient seriousness, he or she should take that concern to the president. If the president then chooses against their position " and if implementing the decision would amount to a violation of conscience " an official should resign. Staying in office to undermine, say, a law or war you disapprove of would be a disturbing arrogation of presidential authority.
But there is an equally important moral priority to consider: If you are a national security official working for a malignant, infantile, impulsive, authoritarian wannabe, you need to stay in your job as long as you can to mitigate whatever damage you can " before the mad king tires of your sanity and fires you.
This paradox is one tragic outcome of Trumpism. It is generally a bad and dangerous idea for appointed officials to put their judgment above an elected official's. And yet it would have been irresponsible for Mattis, Kelly, Tillerson and others not to follow their own judgments in cases where an incompetent, delusional or corrupt president was threatening the national interest.
Consider the case of former White House counsel Donald McGahn. According to the Mueller report, McGahn complained to then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that Trump was trying to get him to 'do crazy s--t.' McGahn (thankfully) told investigators he ignored presidential orders he took to be illegal.
Or consider a negative illustration. When it came to pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, the only morally mature adults in the room (and on the phone) were quite junior in rank. They expressed their concerns upward. But those above them " Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney " had learned the lesson about officials fired for an excess of conscience. They apparently looked the other way as a friendly country was squeezed for political reasons.
On the whole, I'm glad that responsible officials such as Kelly and Mattis stayed as long as they did to prevent damage to the country. But I also think they have a moral obligation to come out before the 2020 election and say what they know about Trump's unfitness. If Biden is the nominee, they might even get together and endorse him. But, in any case, if they believe Trump is a danger to the national interest, they eventually have a duty to say something. Saving the country requires no less.
As for Haley, she has now signaled to Trump Republicans that she was not a part of the 'deep state,' thus clearing away a barrier to ambition. All she had to do was to ignore her conscience, betray her colleagues and injure her country. A small price to pay for such a brilliant political future.

Texto completo: Something weird is going on at Politico.
The newsgroup reports that there is “no evidence” to support the idea that Ukraine worked hand-in-hand with the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign to torpedo then-GOP nominee Donald Trump.
“According to Giuliani," Politico notes, “Ukrainian officials conspired with the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to help boost the Democratic nominee’s campaign and damage Trump’s candidacy. No evidence has emerged to support that idea [emphasis added].
This comes as a bit of a surprise considering reporters Ken Vogel and David Stern reported for Politico in 2017 that “Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office.”
Their article, titled “Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire,” claimed also that Ukrainian officials “disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton’s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.”
“Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton,” the article’s subhead reads.
Here are some especially pertinent passages from the 2017 report (bear with the sheer volume of information; the authors are careful to build their case):
In an interview this month, [Democratic operative named Alexandra Chalupa] told Politico she had developed a network of sources in Kiev and Washington, including investigative journalists, government officials and private intelligence operatives. … [W]hen Trump’s unlikely presidential campaign began surging in late 2015, she began focusing more on the research, and expanded it to include Trump’s ties to Russia, as well. She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign, Chalupa said. In January 2016 … Chalupa told a senior DNC official that, when it came to Trump’s campaign, “I felt there was a Russia connection,” Chalupa recalled. […] [Ukrainian Embassy] officials there became “helpful” in Chalupa’s efforts, she said, explaining that she traded information and leads with them. “If I asked a question, they would provide guidance, or if there was someone I needed to follow up with.” But she stressed, “There were no documents given, nothing like that.” Chalupa said the embassy also worked directly with reporters researching Trump, Manafort and Russia to point them in the right directions. […] Andrii Telizhenko, who worked as a political officer in the Ukrainian Embassy under [Oksana Shulyar, aide to Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly], said she instructed him to help Chalupa research connections between Trump, [Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort], and Russia. “Oksana said that if I had any information, or knew other people who did, then I should contact Chalupa,” recalled Telizhenko, who is now a political consultant in Kiev. “They were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa,” he said, adding “Oksana was keeping it all quiet,” but “the embassy worked very closely with” Chalupa. In fact, sources familiar with the effort say that Shulyar specifically called Telizhenko into a meeting with Chalupa to provide an update on an American media outlet’s ongoing investigation into Manafort. Telizhenko recalled that Chalupa told him and Shulyar that, “If we can get enough information on Paul [Manafort] or Trump’s involvement with Russia, she can get a hearing in Congress by September.” Chalupa confirmed that, a week after Manafort’s hiring was announced, she discussed the possibility of a congressional investigation with a foreign policy legislative assistant in the office of Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), who co-chairs the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus. ... Asked about the effort, the Kaptur legislative assistant called it a “touchy subject” in an internal email to colleagues that was accidentally forwarded to Politico.
Vogel, who reports now for the New York Times, and Stern wrote a lengthy, in-depth, and seemingly well-sourced article for Politico detailing efforts by Ukrainian officials to feed damaging information about Trump and his associates to top Democratic operatives during the 2016 election. But now we are being told by the same newsgroup that there is "no evidence" to support the notion that Ukrainian officials “conspired” with Democratic officers to destroy the Republican nominee?
Huh?
"The 2017 article detailed several instances in which Ukrainian government officials sought to raise questions about Donald Trump and his campaign," a spokesman for Politico said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. "These included alleged instances of cooperation by officials in the Ukrainian embassy to the United States with the efforts of Alexandra Chalupa, a consultant to the Democratic National Committee, to research then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s ties to pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Chalpua said her research was undertaken on her own, though she briefed DNC officials.
He added, "The story also outlined ways in which a Ukrainian parliamentarian in the ruling party touted ledgers that purported to show $12.7 million in payments earmarked for Manafort from a pro-Russian party in Ukraine. And the story cited social media posts and an op-ed by Ukrainian government officials that were highly critical of Trump and his candidacy. The article did not state that the Ukrainian government conspired with the Clinton campaign or the DNC."
In other words, the 2019 Politico reports relies on the distinction between Kyiv operatives working directly with the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee versus what Stern and Vogel reported, which is that Kyiv officials relied on intermediaries to transmit allegedly damaging information about the then-GOP nominee. That is the thinnest of distinctions.
I do not know what else to say but to second journalist Matt Taibbi, who writes that Politico undermining Politico's own reporting on Ukraine is “very reflective of current press lunacy.”

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African-American women.
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.

Texto completo: The city of Ruzhou spent big, then used its health care workers to raise money, as local governments look for ways to keep the economy going.
RUZHOU, China -- When the call came for local doctors and nurses to step up for their troubled community, the emergency wasn't medical. It was financial.
Ruzhou, a city of one million people in central China, urgently needed a new hospital, their bosses said. To pay for it, the administrators were asking health care workers for loans. If employees didn't have the money, they were pointed to banks where they could borrow it and then turn it over to the hospital.
China's doctors and nurses are paid a small fraction of what medical professionals make in the United States. On message boards online and in the local media, many complained that they felt pressured to pony up thousands of dollars they could not afford to give.
"It's like adding insult to injury," a message posted to an online government forum said. Others, speaking to state and local media, asked why money from lowly employees was needed to build big-ticket government projects.
Ruzhou is a city with a borrowing problem -- and an emblem of the trillions of dollars in debt threatening the Chinese economy.
Local governments borrowed for years to create jobs and keep factories humming. Now China's economy is slowing to its weakest pace in nearly three decades, but Beijing has kept the lending spigots tight to quell its debt problems.
In response, a growing number of Chinese cities are raising money using hospitals, schools and other institutions. Often they use complicated financial arrangements, like lease agreements or trusts, that stay a step ahead of regulators in Beijing.
"Whether it is a financial lease or trust, they are just all tools for local governments to borrow," said Chen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong. "Officials stop one today, and they come up with another tool tomorrow."
"That's why China has been talking about curbing local government debts for many years and it's still not solved," Mr. Chen said.
Increasingly these deals are going sour, as they did in Ruzhou, and the loans are going unpaid. Lenders have accused three of Ruzhou's hospitals and three investment funds tied to the city of not paying back their debts.
Local officials have long used big spending to keep the economy growing. Ruzhou is home to a number of white-elephant projects, including a stadium and sports complex turned e-commerce center, now largely unused. A shantytown redevelopment project, begun four years ago to give rural residents new homes, has been slowed for lack of money, locals said.
Ruzhou officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Two employees of The New York Times who traveled to the city were briefly held by the police and forced to leave.
[ These days in China, the economy is a sensitive subject .]
The hidden debts of communities like Ruzhou are a major challenge to the Communist Party. They could disrupt the financial system of the world's second-largest economy if they cause a chain reaction and spill over into other parts of the country and the lives of ordinary people. They also keep Beijing from ramping up lending as a way to juice economic growth.
Nobody is quite sure how big the problem might be. Beijing says the total is about $ 2.5 trillion. Vincent Zhu, an analyst at Rhodium Group, a research firm, puts the figure at more than $ 8 trillion.
"Imagine the economy is a ship like the Titanic," Mr. Zhu said. "Local government debts are like cargo containers piled up on its deck. There are already lots of cargo containers piling up."
Ruzhou, a town surrounded by coal mines in Henan Province, borrowed and spent in line with China's government-driven fads, which helped guarantee that Beijing would pay for much of it.
When Beijing stressed athletics, the city built the sports complex, featuring a 15,466-seat stadium, an indoor basketball court and a convention center complete with an auditorium built in the style of Beijing's Great Hall of the People.
When technology became a priority for Chinese leaders, Ruzhou relabeled the sports complex as the Big Data and E-Commerce center and built an E-Commerce Mansion overlooking the stadium. Today the buildings that house the basketball court and auditorium stand empty, available to rent for events. During the visit by the Times employees, a break-dance group was inspecting the auditorium as a site for a performance.
In China, building these kinds of projects requires some financial engineering. Local governments have limited power to tax and borrow. They depend on getting funds from the central government and selling land to developers. That's not always enough.
To borrow more money, many set up investment-fund-type financial companies called local government financing vehicles. They help raise funds for big infrastructure projects without having to record their debts publicly.
In 2008, when the government unleashed a $ 586 billion economic stimulus package to counter the impact of the global financial crisis, state-owned banks opened the taps and the money flowed into these vehicles.
"You could sit at your desk at your company and banks would come to you and ask if you needed money," said Gao Yinliang, a deputy director of the financing department of Ruzhou Cultural Investment Limited, one of these vehicles.
Then Beijing had a change of heart. Two years ago, senior officials, worried about hidden government debt, told local governments to clean it up. Beijing officials who control the state-run banking system tightened lending.
With bills to pay, Ruzhou turned to aggressive private banks that provided high-interest financing for public projects tied to the city's hospitals. The city took out loans worth tens of millions of dollars and soon had trouble paying.
Beginning late last year, these banks sued three of Ruzhou's hospitals, Ruzhou Cultural Investment and two other government investment funds, saying they had not paid back the more than $ 45 million they owed. In August, the Cultural Investment fund and the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine were placed on a national government blacklist, which will limit their ability to get loans or strike other kinds of business deals.
Mr. Gao denied being involved in borrowing money. "We were just implicated because we were simply the guarantor of the loans," he said.
After the hospitals were sued, their administrators began asking doctors and nurses for money.
In a May memo that was reviewed by The Times, local officials urged hospital managers to help support a local investment fund that was selling bonds. "We encourage managers and staff of local hospitals to buy the above-mentioned convertible bonds to support the construction of their own hospitals," the memo said.
Some hospitals took this to mean employees were required to give money, and managers set quotas.
Doctors and nurses at the traditional Chinese medicine hospital complained to one local state-owned newspaper that they were being ordered to give between $ 14,000 and $ 28,000.
At Ruzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital, nurses and doctors were told they had to invest between $ 8,500 and $ 14,000, according to government online forums and state media.
The government quickly backpedaled.
Zhang Yuhang, the director of Ruzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, denied that the fund-raising had ever been mandatory and blamed the hospital itself for misreading government policy.
"It's all voluntary," he told the local state-owned newspaper.
It is not clear what will happen to Ruzhou's unfinished projects in the meantime. Dozens remain half-built, as if parts of the city had been suddenly abandoned.
Across from the e-commerce center, for example, construction appeared to have halted on a four-building cultural complex. A bright red banner hung across one of the buildings.
"Four places holding hands," it said, then, invoking the government's catchphrase for China's rise, "jointly writing the China Dream."

To the Editor:
Re "If Keanu Reeves's Date Can Embrace Looking Her Age, I Can Too" (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 6):
Ali Drucker's article was a disappointment. I'm not shocked that she was brave enough to admit her vanity and self-doubt; I am disappointed that The New York Times saw fit to publish an article in which a man's endorsement of a woman's natural hair color and "a few noticeable wrinkles" has Ms. Drucker suddenly hopeful that there might be a place in the world for middle-aged women after all, or, as she puts it: "I'd love to stop thinking of the discussion around women and getting older as a transgression."
Here's a thought: Just go ahead and do that. If you need moral support, rather than looking for a man to supply that, consider taking a look at the women in your life.
Perhaps Ms. Drucker has some female relatives or friends who have crossed the Rubicon of 40 -- or is it 30 now? -- and yet still manage to provide some value to the world and are human beings she considers worthy of love and respect. Perhaps she might do those women the honor of modeling her feelings about aging based on real people she knows and cares for, rather than on what Keanu Reeves seems to think about it.
Mr. Reeves seems like a nice enough guy, but let's not put him in charge of this when there are real-life women who can show the way.
Casey Cornelius
New York
To the Editor:
Although I wholly agree with the sentiment of Ali Drucker's article, it is disappointing that it still embraces Hollywood and pictures in the media as the standard by which Ms. Drucker can judge herself, and disappointing that photos of Keanu Reeves's date give Ms. Drucker permission to be satisfied with herself.
On the one hand, Hollywood and the media are undeniably an influence on our lives, and that would be difficult to change. On the other hand, shouldn't that construct itself be challenged whenever possible, to invite people to understand that Hollywood media imagery is unrealistic and irrelevant to one's own physical worth?
Moreover, while Mr. Reeves's date looks like a lovely, attractive person, shouldn't there be more attention to why Mr. Reeves is a "Good Man," according to a tweet mentioned in the article? He apparently has an appreciation and affection for a woman who has a substance of personality and other human traits that outweigh considerations of the physical Hollywood ideal.
Although the paparazzi can't capture it, and pop media has no interest in reporting it, that's the real story!

Chris Christie: The Democrats' Bad Drug Bill
To the Editor:
"Making Drugs More Affordable" (editorial, Nov. 3) acknowledges that under House Democrats' prescription drug price-control legislation, "a handful of new drugs might never get produced." Nevertheless, you urge Americans to accept less medical innovation "in exchange for better prices on the medications that already exist." That's a lousy trade for two reasons.
First, by stifling medical progress, the bill would deny patients new cures, prolonging disability and preventing longer life spans. It's easy to bemoan the cost of innovation, until a loved one gets cancer or Alzheimer's, and new treatments represent her only hope. Second, the editorial grossly underestimates how many new medicines won't be discovered if the Democrats' proposal becomes law.
You cite a Congressional Budget Office projection of eight to 15 fewer drugs, but that's only within the first decade. Since it normally takes 10 to 15 years to develop a medicine, the bill's full impact on innovation won't be felt for a decade.
You admit that price controls would reduce drug company revenues by $ 1 trillion. Those companies spend on average 17 percent of revenue on research. And it takes $ 2.6 billion, on average, to create a single new medicine.
So simple math dictates that by reducing research and development spending by $ 170 billion, the legislation could prevent the development of 65 new medicines, not eight to 15. That means 65 new treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's or diabetes that will never be available to patients.
Whether it is government price setting on prescription drugs or proposals to nationalize the entire American health care system, the policies being advocated by Democratic candidates and policymakers would impose a heavy cost in lost innovation, reduced access to care and unnecessary harm to patients.

Veterans and Moral Injury
To the Editor:
In "Suicide Is Deadlier Than Combat for the Military" (Editorial Observer, Nov. 2), Carol Giacomo calls much-needed attention to an epidemic that is destroying veterans, their families and their communities. But she doesn't articulate the cause of the crisis -- the grief, shame, guilt and moral confusion that are leading our brave men and women to take their own lives.
Moral injury is a wound to the soul and psyche. Where post-traumatic stress affects the body's nervous systems, moral injury affects the mind and the spirit. It causes combat veterans to question the morality of the actions they were ordered to take during combat. It leads to questions like: Was I right or wrong in doing what I did? Am I still a good person if I've done bad things? Can I be forgiven?
The concept of moral injury is critical to understanding why our soldiers are dying by suicide. The open discussion of moral injury and its residual effect on soldiers is integral to helping us heal.

Texto completo: Authorities arrested a man they said had slashed a giant balloon of a baby Donald Trump that was on display to protest the president's visit to a football game in Alabama on Saturday.
The man, Hoyt Hutchinson, 32, was arrested after officers in Tuscaloosa, Ala., saw him cut the balloon and then try to flee about 1 p.m. Saturday, police said on Facebook. It wasn't clear what Hutchinson had used to slash the balloon.
“I am going down here to make a scene, so y'all watch the news," Hutchinson said in a Facebook Live video before the game.
The balloon, which stands 20 feet tall and 13 feet wide when fully inflated, had been set up at a protest at Monnish Park. Trump attended the game about a mile away at Bryant-Denny Stadium featuring the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University.
Hutchinson was charged with first-degree criminal mischief, police said. He was taken to Tuscaloosa County Jail, posted $2,500 bond, and watched the game's third quarter, the Tuscaloosa News reported.
Hutchinson set up a GoFundMe account, “Restitutions for Baby Trump Stabber," to raise money for his legal fees.
“Hoyt made sure our beloved president didn't have to see this disrespectful balloon on the streets of Ttown today!!" the page says. As of Sunday morning, more than $20,000 had been donated. Hutchinson could not be immediately reached Sunday.
A different GoFundMe campaign called “Get Baby Trump to Tuscaloosa" had drawn more than $7,000 to have the balloon at the protest. Organizers said it cost about $4,000 to bring the balloon, anchor it, and staff it.

Sanders to Bloomberg: 'You ain't gonna buy this election'
Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders let loose a volley of sharp attacks against Michael Bloomberg on Saturday night, accusing the former New York mayor in his bluntest language yet of positioning himself to buy the election and vowing to stop him from doing so.
"Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election," said Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, prompting loud cheers from supporters.
The fiery comments, which marked an escalation from earlier and less direct criticism from Sanders, underscored how Bloomberg's recent steps toward entering the Democratic primary have roiled the contest. They also offered a preview of the jabs Bloomberg could face from other candidates if he decides to jump in the race.
The leading liberal candidates, Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts., have significant ideological differences with Bloomberg that would probably flare up if the former mayor challenges them.
Sanders delivered his remarks at a campaign rally in Coralville, Iowa, that marked the end of a two-day swing through this first caucus state with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. Sanders will continue campaigning in Iowa on his own Sunday and Monday.
Bloomberg recently walked back his earlier declaration that he would not run for president, moving to file paperwork for the contest, even as he has stopped short of officially entering. A Bloomberg adviser said Friday that if Bloomberg does get in the race, he would not aggressively compete in the first four caucus and primary states. Sanders knocked him over that strategy.
"You're not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada," warned Sanders. "You're not go to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone."
A Bloomberg adviser did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Washington Post
Klobuchar sees different standard for Buttigieg
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.
Klobuchar's comments marked the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fund-raising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.
They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden's description last week of Warren as "angry" and antagonistic.
In an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Klobuchar, who is on her third term in the Senate, described herself as "the one from the Midwest that's actually won in a statewide race over and over again," adding, "That's not true of Mayor Pete."
A New York Times article on Saturday quoted Klobuchar as saying this summer that she doubts people would take any of the female presidential candidates seriously if they were running with the same qualifications as Buttigieg.
Klobuchar also recently declined to say whether she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be president, the Times reported.
Asked Sunday about those comments, Klobuchar clarified that she does believe Buttigieg is qualified but that she is the better candidate.
Buttigieg's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the third quarter of the year, Buttigieg raised $19.1 million for his presidential bid, a haul that put him third behind Sanders, who raised $25.3 million, and Warren, who raised $24.6 million. Klobuchar raised $4.8 million in the same period.
Recent polls show Buttigieg gaining ground on Biden, Warren, and Sanders, particularly in Iowa, whose caucuses in February mark the first nominating contest of the 2020 primary race. Klobuchar has remained in the single digits.
The Minnesota Democrat's remarks come as Warren has also spoken out against what she views as a double standard against women on the campaign trail.

Rand Paul: Voter 'anger' at play in Ky. governor's race
Republican US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky says Matt Bevin's recent election performance had more to do with voters' displeasure toward Kentucky's GOP governor than their attitudes about Republicans in general.
Paul said Sunday on NBC's "Meet The Press" that there was "sort of a red wave in Kentucky" but teachers were unhappy and their "anger came out" Tuesday in the governor's race. Republicans won the other five statewide races.
Bevin had a running feud with teachers who opposed his efforts to revamp the state's underfunded public pension systems.
Bevin has refused to concede the governor's race to Democrat Andy Beshear after results showed Bevin trailing by more than 5,000 votes out of more than 1.4 million counted. Bevin requested a recanvass, which is set for Nov. 14.

A tale of two colonels

Texto completo: Consider two colonels.

One is Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, the other - Russian President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB lieutenant colonel. Both are Soviet-born.

Of the two colonels, one is trying to uphold order and democracy; the other one is a threat to them.

Colonel Vindman is instrumental in bringing about the undoing of what ex-Colonel Putin helped bring about - the Trump presidency.

Mr. Trump owes his presidency to Mr. Putin, who led a massive election-interference campaign in his favor.

This pundit - among many others - has written extensively about it, so anyone who is interested and is willing to turn to the failing media (in Mr. Trump's terms) can easily find all the supporting arguments within seconds by using a search engine to look me up.

Those who don't trust the mainstream Western media can simply go to YouTube, type Russian parliament applauds election of Donald Trump and watch the 2016 video footage of the Russian parliament bursting into clapping and cheering to an announcement of Mr. Trump's election victory.

Three minutes ago, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her defeat in the U.S. presidential elections and just seconds ago, Trump began his speech as president-elect. I congratulate all of you on this, Foreign Affairs Committee member Vyacheslav Nikonov said in that announcement, as translated by Daily Mail and confirmed by this pundit.

That presidency may eventually unravel thanks, in part, to the other colonel - Colonel Vindman, whose testimony to the House impeachment investigators filled in the blanks left by key words omitted by the White House in an attempt to avoid that impeachment.

According to the far-from-failing New York Times, Colonel Vindman said those omissions included Mr. Trump's assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., discussing Ukraine corruption and an explicit mention by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company, whose board employed Mr. Biden's son Hunter.

In the context of what we already knew from testimonies by the whistle-blower and others, this leaves it beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr. Trump used $400 million of taxpayers' money in the form of military aid to Ukraine - the key U.S. partner in serving a central national security goal of curbing Russia's aggression in Europe - to extort the president of Ukraine to invent dirt on Mr. Trump's key political rival, i.e. former Vice President Biden.

And that does matter, because Mr. Trump undermined national security by doing that.

The critical importance of Ukraine to national security is best summarized in Colonel Vindman's open statement before the House committees on foreign affairs, intelligence, and oversight and reform.

Since 2008, Russia has manifested an overtly aggressive foreign policy, leveraging military power and employing hybrid warfare to achieve its objectives of regional hegemony and global influence, Colonel Vindman states. Absent a deterrent to dissuade Russia from such aggression, there is an increased risk of further confrontations with the West. In this situation, a strong and independent Ukraine is critical to U.S. national security interests because Ukraine is a frontline state and a bulwark against Russian aggression.

If Mr. Trump's actions pertaining to Ukraine do not constitute an impeachable offense, nothing does.

The hope is that the coming public hearings in the impeachment investigation persuade the Republicans to join Democrats in publicly admitting that the abuse of power and obstruction of justice by President Trump and his minions constitute an existential threat to the United States. Ironically, Mr. Trump helps that outcome by causing a backlash to his revolting attempts to smear and undermine Colonel Vindman - a decorated war veteran - and other credible witnesses.

So if we keep up the heat and Mr. Trump's goose is cooked, Mr. Putin can forget about undermining the political process in the United States.

We would then owe that happy outcome first and foremost to such patriots as Colonel Vindman.

Giuliani may have identified secret friend 'Charles' with accidental text

Texto completo: Another accidental message sent to a reporter may have revealed the identity of Rudy Giuliani’s unknown friend “Charles.”
In late October, Giuliani, 75, butt-dialed an NBC reporter and left a three-minute voicemail in which he could be overheard talking to another man about a pending fraud case. Giuliani was overheard saying, "You know Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence."
The comment was made at the beginning of the recording, and without additional context, it was unclear who Charles was. A report from Salon, however, found that Charles Gucciardo may be the individual Giuliani was referring too.
The Salon reporter was tipped off to Giuliani’s ties to Gucciardo after being sent an accidental text message from Giuliani that included what appeared to be an eight-character password.
The reporter returned Giuliani’s message to notify him that he had accidentally sent the password to the wrong contact. Shortly after, the reporter received a call back from someone named Christianné Allen.
Allen, 20, was a Liberty University communications student hired by Giuliani to handle his messaging. Given that it’s unusual for someone with as much status as Giuliani to hire a 20-year-old to run his communications effort, the reporter tried to figure out how the two may have met.
When digging through Allen’s social media, the reporter found that she had worked for Gucciardo Law, a personal injury firm owned by Gucciardo. Other social media posts revealed that the two had met when Allen was at a high school conference with Gucciardo’s son.
Gucciardo was recently featured in a New York Times report because he gave $500,000 to a company called Fraud Guarantees, which was run by Giuliani’s clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman were recently arrested trying to fly to Vienna, a common connection point for flights to Ukraine, for illegal campaign contributions.
When Gucciardo cut the checks to Fraud Guarantees, the company had no prior clients or customers. In his accidental voicemail, Giuliani claimed that “Charles” had a “hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.”
Giuliani’s accidental text that prompted Allen to reach out to the reporter led him to be tied to Gucciardo via his 20-year-old assistant, although the identity of “Charles” has yet to be confirmed.

A search for ancestors in the desert Southwest

Texto completo: On a cool spring day, in the bewitching crystalline light for which New Mexico is famous, I stood in the middle of the Acoma Sky City and looked out into the ocean of desert at an island of pale red and dun colored rock called Enchanted Mesa.
My tour guide, Marissa Chino, a young Acoma woman, said it isn’t known if her people once lived there. There are tales, though, that say they did. One story holds they descended to the valley to tend their squash and corn and, while they were farming, a violent storm washed away a stone ladder that was their only access. With no way back up the monolith, they abandoned their home and moved to the 357-foot tall mesa where the village sits now.
This is only one of the great many mysteries about the ancient Puebloan civilization that once flourished across the desert landscape of the American Southwest and, for a long time, was believed to have vanished.
Its fate has become clearer in recent years, as researchers have peered more deeply into where this civilization went on its “final migration” and listened more closely to the descendants of those once called the Anasazi — Navajo for Enemy Ancestors — who are now known as ancestral Puebloans.
I traveled to the red rock desert of the Southwest to better understand this “lost” civilization. It took some winnowing, as there are numerous parks and monuments to visit. I chose to focus on several major sites in northern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado.
To start, from Albuquerque I drove an hour to Sky City and stopped at the impressive visitor center, which includes the Haak’u museum with its collection of Acoma pottery. Two buses carried me and a group of 30 or so leather-jacketed Norwegian motorcyclists on a short ride to the collection of houses at the top of the giant mesa. This low-slung, earth-colored village, with its rough and uneven stone streets, is one of the four communities that make up the Acoma Pueblo, which is one of the state’s 19 modern-day pueblos. Sitting in an immense and surreal landscape, with its broad palette of dusky reds and browns beneath a vast sky, it is one of the most sublime settings for a town in North America.
Acoma means “people of the white rock,” and Sky City is one of the longest inhabited settlements in North America, tracing its founding to around 1100 A.D. Between 10 and 13 families live here in small and neatly kept adobe homes. Water must be hauled in, and there is no electricity.
For an hour I followed our guide around the ancient village. Beehive-shaped clay pottery kilns, fired with wood or cow dung, sit behind the homes, with piles of firewood stacked alongside. The inimitable southwest fragrance of sweet burning pinyon pine wafted in the air.
We walked toward the towering adobe, dirt-floor church. A graveyard surrounded by a crude adobe wall sits in the front of the church where Acoma people are buried several layers deep. The top is studded with a mix of white wooden crosses, stone tablets and plastic flowers.
Spanish conquistadores came to this region in the 16th century seeking the fabled Seven Cities of Gold. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado showed up first, in 1540, but others followed, and as we stood inside the church our guide related some of the grim history of Acoma. After a small battle with soldiers sent to negotiate, the conquistador Don Juan Oñate attacked the mesa and killed hundreds of men, women and children. He took 500 prisoners and sentenced those over 25 to 20 years of servitude. He ordered the right feet and hands of some two dozen captives amputated.
The Acoma people returned here after their servitude, and in 1628, the Catholic Church forced them to build this structure, the San Esteban del Rey Mission church — an unusual blend of Spanish colonial and Puebloan architecture. All of the materials, including the logs and dirt for the walls, had to be found elsewhere and carried up from the valley floor. It took 12 years to build.
Just as I began to walk back to the visitor center, down the narrow and precipitous stone path that the Acoma used before the road was built in 1929 by a film company, our guide pointed out a small, opaque mica window in one of the homes. The window glints in the sun like gold, she said, and when the Spanish saw it they thought they’d found one of the legendary Seven Cities of Gold. It is the only original mica window that remains here.
The Pueblo culture goes back centuries before the time of Christ. Pueblos evolved from pit houses — holes in the ground covered with a raised wooden roof — to labyrinthine dwellings with hundreds of rooms built with strikingly sophisticated masonry techniques, that peaked in the 10th and 11th centuries.
What’s been recognized in recent years is that the Ancestral Puebloans didn’t vanish. Whether because of a withering drought, deforestation and soil erosion, or attacks from other tribes, or a combination of these things, their vast empire shrank and became the pueblos of New Mexico.
— The great houses of Chaco Canyon
I drove north from Acoma, seeking out more back story. Two hours on — the last half of it on a rutted, severely wash-boarded dirt road — I spied Fajada Butte, the towering landform at the head of a long, shallow sandstone canyon called Chaco, now the Chaco Culture National Historical Park.
First occupied in 800, Chaco was where the Pueblo culture reached its greatest heights until, tree rings tell us, it was abandoned in the mid-13th century. The park contains the largest collection of pre-Columbian ruins in the United States and is a UNESCO World Heritage site.
While most American Indians were hunters and gatherers, the Puebloans were also accomplished tillers of the soil, irrigating the wild desert in this canyon with captured rainwater. Staying in one place for long periods is a large part of what allowed this civilization to evolve to such a magnificent apogee in a harsh desert landscape.
I toured Pueblo Bonito with Clif Taylor, a knowledgeable Park Service volunteer who has spent 12 seasons here. Taylor is a fount of information, yet is only able to scratch the surface on a two-hour tour. He too is taken with the mystery of this place. For centuries it was home to thousands of people and “over a few decades it virtually emptied out,” he said.
Pueblo Bonito is the largest and grandest of the 12 “great houses” at Chaco, with some 600 rooms and 40 kivas, which are large, round ceremonial rooms dug into the earth and lined with stone masonry.
The evolution of the ancestral Puebloans is mirrored in the evolution of their masonry, from pit-houses where the foundation was made of rocks roughly stacked atop each other, to the structures at Chaco, where many millions of pieces of stone, ranging in size from a deck of cards to a large book and larger, are fitted precisely together up to five stories high. More than 240,000 trees, cut in the distant mountains, were used in construction of the great houses of Chaco.
The remains of the massive D-shaped structure of Pueblo Bonito, which covered 2½ acres, has been a treasure trove for archaeologists since the late 19th century.
The artifacts uncovered here boggle the mind. A few from the long list: hundreds of gorgeous ollas or large round pots, clay ladles, bowls, animal effigy pots and other vessels covered with black geometric designs over a white slip. There are the sumptuous burials of 37 sacred macaws, the gorgeous red, blue, yellow and green parrots, brought here from southern climes and likely bred for their rainbow of resplendent sacred feathers.
A jet frog, black as coal and the size of a child’s fist, with inlaid turquoise eyes and a turquoise collar, is one of the most prized artifacts from Chaco, likely a rain fetish.
Then there is the mystery of Room 33.
That’s where two high status individuals — “major dudes’,” according to one archaeologist — were found buried beneath a wooden platform with another dozen remains scattered in the sand above them. No one knows who they were. The room also contained more than 50,000 pieces of turquoise, 6,000 pieces of worked shell, turquoise-encrusted conch shell trumpets and a collection of carved wooden flutes.
The ability to appreciate the beauty and mystery of a giant buzzing pre-Columbian capital in Chaco is enhanced by the isolation and minimal development. It is quietly exhilarating to wander in the sunshine among the glorious remnants of such an elaborate and alien city, with just a scattered handful of other visitors. You can almost hear the barking dogs, the calls of a bevy of children and the gobbling of turkeys that once wandered here.
As I walked I noticed a distant storm and a trail in the sky of lace-like virga, or shafts of rain that hang from a cloud, never making it to the ground.
At night here, with the lights of cities far away, the sky is a midnight fabric stitched with glowing glass beads.
Archaeoastronomers — those who study how ancient people related to the sky — tell us that many of the walls and windows at Chaco are aligned with cardinal points, the sun and other stars, and the buildings functioned as an observatory and calendar. Then there’s the famous sun dagger. On the summer solstice a sharp beam of light shines through slabs of fallen rock and pierces the exact center of a spiral petroglyph.
Despite what is known here, what exactly this fantastic city was remains unknown, and the mystery endures. “It was built to be impressive,” Taylor said. “A big beautiful city like Manhattan. It may well have been an area of transcendental significance like Mecca. The canyon itself could have been a sipapu,” a sacred opening in the earth that are symbolically represented in kivas around the Southwest.
The characters who were entranced by the mystery of these ruins and the vanished people, and who excavated and explored these places, have their own interesting stories. Richard Wetherill is the most well known, the son of a rancher, who, when he first spied treasures in the ground, leapt off his horse and began digging. He never stopped.
An accomplished amateur archaeologist, Wetherill led an expedition here in 1896, funded by two wealthy young brothers, Talbot and Frederic Hyde. The first year Wetherill unearthed a boxcar full of artifacts, Taylor told me. “They shipped them back East and they are housed in the basement of the American Museum of Natural History.”
There has been much plundering of the sites here and across the Four Corners region by profiteers. The Antiquities Act of 1906, which protects property on federal lands (and allows the president to unilaterally create national monuments without consulting Congress) was initiated because of the theft of artifacts from Chaco.
— The cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde
After a day of hiking around Chaco I tooled north a few hours, heading for the ruins of another great Puebloan civilization, at Mesa Verde National Park.
Chaco’s structures were built in the open canyon bottoms, but the people of Mesa Verde were largely cliff dwellers, likely as a way to fend off Apache, Ute and other raiders. Toe and hand holds that allowed access to the precipitous dwellings remain carved in the sandstone cliffs. The people farmed on the top of the mesa and lived in the dwellings.
From the visitor center I drove 15 miles to the top of Chapin Mesa to tour a series of sites that track the evolution of ancient home building. As I drove the vistas became more incredible, a vastness that stole my breath. I live in the big sky country of Montana, and I am no stranger to expansive views, but this was impressive.
A series of stops on the 6-mile loop provides a look at how the houses evolved over nearly seven centuries, from the seventh century to the 13th century, from pit houses to the sophisticated adobe and stone block buildings wedged into cliff alcoves, such as Oak Tree House, that reminded me for all the world of mud swallow nests.
My last stop was the Zia Pueblo, a half-hour from Albuquerque, to see what Peter Pino, a former war chief and cultural leader, had to say about the ancestral Puebloans he calls his grandfathers.
Pino graciously invited me into his home, and we sat on the couch to talk. I spied some Zia pottery, which famously features a bird motif. Why did so much of the pottery use it, I asked. “Birds occupy a region that we humans don’t — the heavens,” he said. “The world they see is a lot bigger than ours. To native people that is supernatural.”
The pueblos at Chaco and elsewhere are not cold and sterile piles of rock, he said, but alive with the spirit of the pueblo people’s ancestors. “All those sites are sacred,” Pino said. “They are places of significance to the pueblo people. Our people aren’t there anymore, but the spirits of our people are still there.”

Texto completo: We’ve had the baby. So why not the nanny?
Donald Trump has turned the White House — and America — into his crib, wailing and spitting up and throwing things. Republican lawmakers have been consigned to diaper duty. So maybe it’s fitting for Mrs. Doubtfire to pop in to lay down the law in this federally funded nursery.
As in love, voters in presidential races often look for the opposite of what they’ve had. George W. Bush was uninformed and impulsive, so enter Barack Obama. Obama painted cautiously in gray tones, so enter the kaleidoscopic Donald Trump.
Now Trump’s vertiginous reign and policies on climate, guns and trade may have inspired the pragmatic Michael Bloomberg to step up as his opposite. Someone from Bloomberg-world told Axios that if the former mayor of New York jumps in, he will spend “whatever it takes” to defeat Trump.
“All across America, people are clutching their Big Gulps,” David Axelrod cracked.
It’s not a good sign for Democrats — or flagging Joe Biden — that the 77-year-old plutocrat is casting himself as the savior of the party. The trembling Democratic donor class was overjoyed that a Wall Street guy might jump in. But a Bloomberg bid could open the door for Elizabeth Warren to run away with the nomination.
Still, it would be undeniably entertaining to have a stinging face-off between a couple of rich, caustic New Yorkers who have skyscrapers known by their names blocks apart.
“Little Michael,” as Trump calls Bloomberg, versus the Big Fraud, as Bloomberg thinks of Trump. Maybe they could just conduct the whole campaign at Hudson Yards.
One is a real deal-maker who cares about public policy and one is a fake deal-maker who only cares about himself. One self-made billionaire who’s good at business would mock the so-called billionaire and bankruptcy king who needed a constant cash flow from daddy Fred. One is in the media business and one denounces the press as degenerates, lowlifes and enemies of the people. One is a genuine philanthropist and one was just ordered to pay $2 million in damages after admitting money raised by his charitable foundation was used in part for his presidential bid and to settle business debts. One is totally controlling and one is totally out of control. One rants about trans fats and one gorges on them.
Both of these salesmen can be charming or thin-skinned and arrogant. Both have politically fluid histories. Both have their feet to thank for keeping them out of Vietnam; Bloomberg had flat feet and Trump (supposedly) had bone spurs. Both have been accused of having a sexist streak, even though they supported Hillary Clinton at times and have voiced appreciation for smart women. And both men have talked openly about their love of beautiful women.
As Bloomberg told me in 2001, right after the bachelor announced he would run for mayor: “Nobody has ever accused me of not being interested in women. I have the other problem when they write the story.” Trump once had a date with Candice Bergen and Bloomberg had a dinner with Diana Ross. Bloomberg talked about his love of Bond girls but, unlike Trump, preferred more mature women in real life.
“I find women my age more interesting, I guess,” he told me. “Maybe it’s just that I have less in common with younger women. It’s also safer. Somehow or other, the wives of your friends find it much more reassuring.”
Trump didn’t waste any time trashing a possible new opponent, focusing on looks, as usual. Mr. Rogers said that making people feel less than they are was the greatest evil, but for Trump, it’s the most fun.
“He doesn’t have the magic to do well,” the president said of Bloomberg as he left the White House Friday morning for a trip to Georgia, adding, “Little Michael will fail.”
While it is true that “kinetic TV personality” are not words you would connect to Bloomberg, the media mogul does know how to go for the jugular. Remember his Philly smackdown at the Democratic convention?
In 2015, when Bloomberg the company reported that Trump was worth only $2.9 billion, Trump was hot under the Brioni collar. He suggested that Bloomberg the man had encouraged his reporters to write a lower number because he was jealous that Trump was running for president and, referring to the Bloomberg financial data terminals, scoffed: “I wouldn’t have one of their little screens.”
Told recently that Ivanka Trump felt betrayed by his speech at the Democratic convention, because she considered him a good friend, Bloomberg did some scoffing of his own, saying that they had never been close.
Whenever I talked to Bloomberg over the years about running, it was clear he wanted to and felt he would do a great job as Nanny in Chief. But all the polls he commissioned made him think it was not feasible. He didn’t want to run against Hillary, and at first he didn’t see a path to run this time. But watching Biden implode and Mayor Pete climb and seeing the gazillion-dollar “Medicare for All” plan of Warren — whom Bloomberg thought had a shot as recently as the fall — all combined to tempt him toward a 2020 race.
As The Times’ Michael Grynbaum tweeted, slyly summing up the Gotham derby: “How many New York City personalities can one country handle?”
But then, Trump hasn’t been too friendly to New York lately. He changed his primary residency to Palm Beach, and on Friday, when he was asked about the fine on his foundation, he barked, “New York is a corrupt state.”
And he should know.

OK, boomers, welcome to the other side of generation gap

Texto completo: Back in 1965, only a couple of years after the term "baby boomer" caught on as a label for the generation born in the wake of World War II, one 17-year-old high school newspaper columnist tried to explain his generation to his skeptical elders:
"Although we still have to face our responsibilities someday," he wrote, "our first impulse is to turn our backs and form a second society of our own. Someday we shall know for whom the bells toll but, for now, their sound is covered by the sounds of our hot rods and Beatles records."
That young journalist was me. I wrote that bold, manifesto-like essay, "New Breed of Teen Creates Second Society," in the March 2 edition of the biweekly newspaper at Middletown High School in Middletown, Ohio. It even won an award from a high school journalism association for best feature story, which helped make up for my failure to make the school's basketball team.
More than a half-century later, I find myself rereading that piece to reacquaint myself with my high school version of me, now that my generation faces a new cultural assault from post-boomers.
I'm referring to the odd internet meme "OK, boomer," which has gone viral globally as Generations X, Y and Z's all-purpose retort to older people, bless our hearts, who just don't get it.
Appropriately, this craze reportedly began on TikTok, a web application still almost unknown to those of us who are still wondering why Snapchat is any better than Facebook. In one well-known clip on TikTok, a man of senior years grumbles, "The millennials and Generation Z have the Peter Pan syndrome, they don't ever want to grow up." That brought thousands of replies, most of which were "ok boomer," The New York Times reported.
The hashtag #okboomer went global. In New Zealand, Chlöe Swarbrick, a 25-year-old member of Parliament, went viral on video when she was heckled by an older member during a speech supporting a climate crisis bill. She casually responded with a terse, "OK, boomer," and resumed her speech without missing a beat.
A more recently viral variation satirized news that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was preparing a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination: "OK, Bloomer."
But some attempts can be a tweet too far. Conservative Rochester radio host Bob Lonsberry, 60, tweeted this clunker of a protest tweet last weekend: "'Boomer' is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new."
Tsk, tsk. Thanks, Mr. Lonsberry, for adding to my examples of how you don't have to be a liberal to act like a PC "snowflake."
On the other hand, my own millennial son, Grady Page, age 30, tells me he is "extremely critical of the idea that there's anything new about a millennial identity."
Today's "OK, boomer," delivered with suitable eye-rolling condescension, is only a "repetition of the generation gap" that I was writing about in the 1960s. "Only it's worse," he said, "because at least in the '60s you had some sort of a real social critique that went along with that," like the anti-war movement, "war on poverty" and the civil rights movement.
"Now everybody's just seeking to identify with products and tastes for things like avocado toast," he said.
Hey, lay off the avocado toast. That's one of the Generation Z fads that I find to be pretty good.
More seriously, I think he's shortchanging the explosion of activism that we have seen around issues like climate change, gun safety and police brutality in his own generation, which has more reasons than mine to care about them.
Nevertheless, we agreed that if the "OK, boomer" meme encourages the generations to talk to each other more, it can be a force for good.
When I wrote my high school newspaper report (did I mention that it won a prize?), I focused on how my generation's youngsters were trying to construct a "second society" all their own. Decades later, I realize that every generation tries to do that. It's not a different society as much as it is an attempt to improve the old one.
I finished that essay with a line from a hit by the British rockers the Animals: "I'm just a soul whose intentions are good / Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."
I think we're still trying to do that. But now that we have fewer days ahead of us than we have behind us, we boomers have to face an unavoidable reality. We tried our best, but the future increasingly belongs to new generations. OK, boomers?

What polls don't tell you about Trump's standing in state

Texto completo: With a year to go before the 2020 election, some national polls show Donald Trump facing daunting, double-digit deficits in his re-election bid.
But the polling in Wisconsin and other swing states paints a far more competitive picture.
Can both be right?
The gap between Trump's worst national polls and his best battleground polls is so big it simply doesn't add up.
But it also reflects something very real about the political landscape: that nationwide surveys don't always capture what's happening in the handful of states most likely to determine the Electoral College winner.
Wisconsin is a prime example. It is at the top of the list of pivotal battlegrounds in the eyes of most analysts, suggesting that public opinion here shouldn't deviate all that much from what it is nationally. Yet Trump has performed consistently better in Wisconsin than he has in nationwide polls.
The president is averaging in the low 40s in job approval in national surveys.
But in Wisconsin, he is at 46% approval in a Marquette Law School poll released two weeks ago, 47% in a New York Times/Siena poll released Monday, 44% in a Fox News poll released last month, and 42% in a poll just released by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Cook Political Report. Trump's average job approval in those four surveys is 45%, far from stellar but not crippling to his re-election prospects either.
"I think the battleground polls are more meaningful" than the national polls, said Diane Feldman, a longtime Democratic pollster who has conducted many surveys in Wisconsin.
The seeming disconnect between national surveys and battleground surveys was highlighted this week when the New York Times published polls showing Trump either tied, narrowly behind or narrowly ahead of his best-known Democratic rivals in the key states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
Takeaway: In the states that matter most, the race is up for grabs.
A day later, a nationwide Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Trump trailing Joe Biden by 17 points, Elizabeth Warren by 15 and Bernie Sanders by 14.
Takeaway: Trump is in dire, dire straits.
"There is a profound disconnect between the state-level polling on the horse race and what we're seeing in the national polling. I don't know whether Joe Biden is up by 17 points nationally or if he's only up a couple of points in Wisconsin, but both can't be true," said political scientist Ken Goldstein, who conducts his own polls in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
Part of the explanation involves different pollsters using different methodologies and capturing different cross-sections of voters with different partisan leanings. Feldman said sometimes national polls oversample the populous coasts, which would skew a survey toward Democrats.
Part of the explanation involves the normal variations in polling that always produce occasional outliers.
But that still leaves the fact that, as the 2016 election showed, the Electoral College picture can deviate from the picture of the nation as a whole. Three years ago, Trump won the decisive battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania by under 1 point while losing the national vote by 2 points.
If that pattern holds, Democrats might have to win the popular vote by 3 points or more in 2020 to carry the key state battlegrounds they need to win the Electoral College.
Polling since Trump took office reinforces that point.
"In Wisconsin, our (Trump) approval number has been consistently about 3 points higher than his national average," said Charles Franklin, who conducts the Marquette poll. Trump has averaged a little under 46% approval in Wisconsin over the past year in Marquette's polling.
As a result of this gap, anyone focused on the polling in battleground Wisconsin is probably going to get a more competitive picture of the electoral fight than he or she would get from national surveys, where Trump is typically getting approval ratings of 41% to 44% — or, in the case of the Washington-Post-ABC poll, 39%.
"The news this week was unequivocally bad for the White House if you were looking at national polls and unequivocally bad for the Democrats if you were looking at state polls," said Goldstein, a political science professor with the University of San Francisco and before that, the University of Wisconsin-Madison. (The White House also got bad news with the GOP's election setbacks Tuesday, losing legislative control in Virginia and a contest for governor in Kentucky).
"Battleground states are battlegrounds precisely because they're close. We should expect Wisconsin and probably Pennsylvania and North Carolina or Florida and Arizona to be pretty close states," Franklin said.
There have been variations in both the state and national polls. Nationally, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump trailing Biden by 9 points, while Trump's deficit in the Washington Post survey is almost twice as large.
In Wisconsin, a Fox News poll released in early October had Biden leading Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points. The recent Marquette poll had Biden leading by 6. The New York Times/Siena poll had Biden leading by 3.
While the New York Times poll puts Trump's approval here at 47% and Marquette puts it at 46%, the new Kaiser survey puts it at 42%. One thing that could explain these differences is that in the Marquette poll, the mix of Republican and Democratic voters was close to even; in the Kaiser survey, the sample was more Democratic-leaning in its makeup.
But in the case of the state's most frequent poll (by Marquette), Trump's ratings have been remarkably consistent. The president's approval ratings in the last six Marquette polls dating back to October 2018 are: 46, 47, 44, 46, 45 and 46%. Those numbers have deviated even less than you would expect simply from random statistical variation.
Franklin said his numbers are very consistent with the possibility that Trump's true level of approval among all registered voters in Wisconsin hasn't changed at all over the past year.
What do Trump's job ratings in Wisconsin suggest about his prospects of winning the state again?
If you believe that a president's approval rating is highly predictive of the incumbent's share of the vote, that would suggest Trump is at a significant disadvantage in this state right now.
"Every president running for reelection over the last 60 years has received on Election Day a percentage of the popular vote within a point of their job approval number," ABC news analyst Matthew Dowd, a strategist for President George W. Bush who now considers himself an independent, wrote this week.
But some experts believe Trump can and will "overperform" his approval rating, as he over-performed his popularity rating in 2016.
Why? Because so many of his own supporters have such mixed feelings about him personally that it holds down his overall approval rating among people who are happy with key aspects of his performance — such as the economy — and will end up voting for him anyway. Others who dislike Trump may end up disliking the Democratic nominee even more, which happened in 2016.
"He has a vote that goes beyond the voters that approve of him," Feldman said.
Trump's flat approval ratings make it incumbent upon him to drive up the "negatives" of the Democratic nominee, said Ed Goeas, a GOP pollster.
"It's going to be driven by how high the negatives of his opponent are," said Goeas, who doesn't think Trump's approval number is as good a guide to his re-election performance as it has been for past presidents.
"His approval overall is kind of a worst-case scenario for him," he said.
Franklin said the Wisconsin polling suggests "the president's job approval has been consistently net negative, but not enormously so. He has been behind Biden in the (last two Marquette polls) but quite competitive with the other Democrats."
The Marquette pollster said, "it would be wrong to see the state as anything other than close," with Trump still facing an "uphill" battle due to his negative ratings.
"Everyone's obsession with Wisconsin isn't just hype. It's truly competitive," Goldstein said. "Trump is very much in a gray area, where he would be in trouble if this were a pure referendum (on him) but has a chance because it's going to be a choice."
Feldman, the Democratic pollster, said "We are maybe looking at a situation that is more similar to 2016 than (Democrats) would like it to be," meaning a very narrowly decided contest.
If that is true, then after all this time, Wisconsin would be right back where it was in the last election — on a knife's edge.

Texto completo: "Ford v Ferrari" stars a couple of Oscar winners named Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who are exceptionally good as two racing rebels fighting the corporate mind-set in the midst of Ford Motor Co.'s quest to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.
That's why it's even even more impressive that Tracy Letts — who has a supporting role as Henry Ford II, the ultimate 1960s CEO — dominates every scene that he's in.
Imposing, inflexible and blunt, Letts is mesmerizing as Ford rails about "getting it in the tailpipe from Chevy Impala" and orders Carroll Shelby (Damon) to "go to war" against Ferrari.
When rising young executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) initially urges Ford to take on European racing, Iacocca says, "James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir."
"That's because he's a degenerate," retorts the man nicknamed in the press as "Hank the Deuce."
Don't be surprised if Letts becomes a favorite on Oscar prediction lists. The Gold Derby awards site has praised his performance in "Ford v Ferrari," noting, "It's the kind of supporting role Oscars were made for: a transformative, scene-stealing portrait of a real historical figure."
The 54-year-old Letts already has nabbed some top honors. The actor and playwright has won a Pulitzer for writing "August: Osage County" and a Tony for his performance in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" He's probably best known to moviegoers for his roles as the dad in "Lady Bird" and a newspaper executive in "The Post."
Letts currently has one play on Broadway, the midlife-crisis comedy/drama "Linda Vista," and another opening March 15, the politically themed "The Minutes," in which he'll play the mayor of a divided city.
During a phone interview, he admits that he gets "asked to play a lot of hard-asses, guys in suits, and stuff like that."
He credits the strength of the screenplay of "Ford v Ferrari" (co-written by another acclaimed playwright, Jez Butterworth) — and, in particular, moments like Ford's weeping meltdown after riding in the GT40 race car — as the reason he wanted to do the movie.
Letts appreciated "the fact that that scene gave an opportunity to show the vulnerability of this guy, to show a human side."
In real life, Henry Ford II was a titan of industry and a familiar icon for Detroiters, who knew him as a businessman, philanthropist and celebrity who moved in jet-set circles.
When Ford died in 1987 at age 70, the New York Times noted that he would settle arguments by saying, "My name is on the building." During his career, he presided over great successes for the company and notable failures, including the flop of the Edsel car.
Beyond his corporate legacy, Ford also played a big role in Detroit civic life, supporting social reform and striving to help revive Detroit's downtown after the 1967 rebellion with the massive Renaissance Center on the riverfront.
Ford also was a society figure in gossip columns known for hearty partying. After a drunk driving arrest in the 1970s, he famously commented, "Never complain, never explain."
Letts recalls a recent fancy gala dinner where he and his wife, actress Carrie Coons, chatted about "Ford v Ferrari" with a woman at his table. "I mentioned Henry Ford (II) and she said, 'Oh, well, we know the Fords!' We said, 'Oh wow, you do?' and she said, as a way of explanation, 'Well, we're from Michigan.' "
Not everyone here is friends with the Fords, but it someones feels as if we are. And Detroiters are likely to appreciate Letts as Ford and the complexities he brings to the part.
"I tried to give it an essence of a guy who is certainly a titan of industry. By all accounts, Henry Ford II was a larger-than-life figure, but also a guy who feels the weight of his legacy, the idea that his name is Henry Ford, of all things. It's his name on the car. He deals with pressures that the rest of us can only imagine."
Letts admits he was able to do a limited amount of research. He read some books, watched old clips of Ford at press conferences and saw a documentary commissioned by Ford.
"The truth is, the script was really well-written and so much of what I needed to know in order to play the part was on the page," he says. "Jim Mangold, the director, and I, we talked about it. We didn't see the need to try to do a Henry Ford II impersonation. ... He's not Johnny Cash or Elvis or something, where to be too far off would be disorienting to the audience."
Letts credits the meticulously researched sets and wardrobe — Ford's office is a mammoth, wood-paneled space with an elaborate cocktail bar, very "Mad Men" — with helping him transform into the Deuce.
"One of the great things about making 'Ford v Ferrari' was how much of the work was done for us. And one of the ways it was done is the movie is very tactile," says Letts. "Everything is solid. We weren't acting with green screens. The cars are real. Everything is real. The first thing I shot was in that office, I put on my suit and I got the haircut. I walked on the set and saw that office and said, 'My work is done. ... I can just sit here and be the most powerful person in the room.'"
In real life, Ford was proud of his epic push for a Le Mans victory and the GT40 that made it possible. In 1966, before the first Ford victory, he told Sports Illustrated that advances spurred by the development of that race car had been incorporated into passenger vehicles and trucks and would continue to be. "We call our GT cars 'laboratories on wheels,' " he bragged.
Yet it was a long, hard road to victory with some devastating setbacks. Letts captures that wonderfully in a scene where the Deuce sits silent and immobile opposite an empty chair, waiting to hear a disappointing update from Damon's Shelby, the iconic race car designer who joined the GT40 project.
Shelby sits down next to Ford instead of choosing the hot seat. Ford keeps staring unflinchingly ahead.
Letts said he and Damon just happened to choose those spots in the first rehearsal. "Jim told me later, he said, 'I looked at it and said "Jesus, is this going to work, these two guys not looking at each other?" ' But the more he looked at it, the more he realized, 'Oh, it is going to work and I want to shoot it like that.' It seemed like an interesting way to play it instead of the guy glowering behind a desk."
Letts didn't spend time in Detroit or visit Ford's sprawling Dearborn campus before the movie. Filming was done in California. The scene where he's driven to tears after experiencing the GT40's speed was done at an airport in the city of Ontario.
Does he think the automotive company would invite him inside its headquarters? "I would hope so," he says.
At Monday's Hollywood premiere, Letts got an indication that he might be let in the door. He met a few descendants of the Deuce before the screening in what he describes as a pleasant encounter. Among those attending the event was William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford.
"A couple of members of the Ford family came up and spoke to me, and I have to say, they were very good sports about all of it," says Letts, who mischievously clarifies that he didn't talk to them after the screening.

Texto completo: The artist takes our "Make T Something" challenge and creates a sculpture in under one hour using some unexpected materials.
Growing up in the '90s, as television's cultural monopoly gave way to that of the early internet, the Baltimore-born artist Derrick Adams processed the era's evolving visual language in his sketchbook. What he observed -- the predominant whiteness of sitcoms and talk shows, the exoticized depiction of people of color -- left a permanent impression, one that still inspires him to imagine his own alternative cultural narratives. "My images come from things I want to see in the world, portraits of blackness that have not yet had their moment," he says of his work. "What is the point of perpetuating, repeating, what is already out there?"
Adams's large-scale installations use painting, sculpture, performance and photography to tell stories about the intricacies and politics of domestic life and how it has been portrayed throughout history. For instance, for "Sanctuary," his 2018 show at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, the artist erected a miniature wooden highway in a room whose walls were hung with collages of brick walls and abstract shapes that evoked quickly glimpsed landscapes. The installation was the result of his intensive research into "The Negro Motorist Green Book," a guide published between 1936 and 1967 that advised black travelers on how to navigate through the Jim Crow South, and, like much of his work, it offered new ways to understand seemingly familiar environments: the home, the city, the screen, the South.
[ Sign up here for the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting now.]
To coincide with his current exhibition, "Where I'm From," at Baltimore City Hall Gallery, we invited Adams to take part in our "Make T Something" series, in which a person must create something in under one hour using only a copy of The New York Times, some basic craft supplies and one wild-card item of their choosing (for Adams, a box of black disposable gloves). Presented with two different recent editions of The Times, Adams selected the paper with a front-page story about the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. "Usually when I'm working in my studio, the art comes from my drawings and prolonged research, but for this project it was about a gut reaction to something immediate," he says. The resulting mixed-media sculpture, "If Only Pompey Were Here To Save Us," is a tangle of wire and inflated black hands, surrounding an image of a tragedy, that hints at the revisionist histories that Adams's work so often tackles.
"Where I'm From" is on view at Baltimore City Hall Gallery, 100 N. Holliday Street, Baltimore, through November 22.

Texto completo: Two sisters talk candidly about their lives after being sexually abused as children. It has been 10 years, but online photos and videos continue to haunt them.
Two sisters from the Midwest are among the untold number of survivors of child sexual abuse who say they are unable to escape their horrific experiences because of the internet.
Millions of photos and videos of children being sexually abused exist on a wide range of platforms, from Dropbox to Facebook Messenger, for criminals around the world to see. An investigation by The New York Times found that the technology industry has consistently failed to take coordinated steps to shut down the illegal content.
Because online predators sometimes stalk people in the photos and videos, the two sisters, now 17 and 21, do not discuss their experiences publicly for fear of being recognized. They agreed, however, to talk to The Times if they were not named. They are identified here by their first initials, F. and E.
When they were 7 and 11, the sisters were sexually abused by their father. In one video, the younger sister, F., was drugged and raped by him and another man. Both men are now in prison, but the imagery continues to circulate on the web.
This year alone, photos and videos of the sisters were found in over 130 child sexual abuse investigations involving mobile phones, computers and cloud storage accounts.
The following has been condensed and edited for clarity from recorded conversations with the sisters and their mother.
Q. What do you want people to know about online child sexual abuse?
E. It's more than just images. When I'm in public with my little sister and I see some man looking at her, that is one of the first things I think about. You're always worried. Already as a girl you always have to think about that kind of stuff, like guys being creepy. But then it's something like, "Have they seen a picture of you when you were a kid?" It's going to be there forever, and you just learn to deal with it.
F. People think I'm really fragile. I try to let people know that I went through that. I would love to speak out about it. We're out of sight, out of mind. If it can help other people, and if I can talk to other victims and help them feel better, that's all I want.
How do you talk to friends and others about the abuse?
E. If people ask me, I'll tell them. But I usually spare them. I'm like: "You don't want the answer to this question. It's going to shock you, and then you're going to feel weird and I'm going to feel weird." People like to ask me, "What about your dad?" And there's just no simple answer to that. I can just say, "Oh, he's in jail." But everyone is going to ask why he's in jail. And every time I'll just tell them. I'll just say, "He's a child molester." And they're like, "You're kidding, right?"
F. I'm ready to talk about it. It's not easy, but I want to do it because I know that it could help someone else. I've heard other people talk about it, and then it inspires me. It's very hard to talk about, but I think it's really important.
What does it mean to you that pictures of you are still out there?
E. It just sucks that it's still going on, because the pictures are still circulating. It's like another form of abuse. People would say: "It's just pictures. Who are they hurting?" No, that's so violating. If those were pictures of you, you would understand. It's not like a harmless thing because of that.
F. It angers me more than upsets me. That stuff just really makes me mad that I've been through it and that so many people are still doing that stuff. It scares me for other kids because, you know, I'm more of a person where I get concerned for other people over myself. So it scares me. They have my pictures. They are out there. If you're looking at that, you're obviously out there looking at little girls. Eventually, you're going to want to act on it. And I just don't want anybody else to go through what I went through.
What is the biggest burden right now?
E. What sucks is you almost get your voice taken away too. If it were up to me, if it weren't so dangerous, I would love to just say my name, put my face out there and say what I want to say. It takes away the personal part of it.
F. When it first happened, I was so young and I didn't really process it for a long time. When he first got arrested, I was like, "Why is he getting arrested?" When that stuff was happening, he would drug me, so I wouldn't really know. It was more just like losing my dad in general. But then as I grew up, more stuff was bothering me, but I didn't know that was the cause of it. The way that I would do things, the way that I would react to things, was because of that event, but I never really made that connection. And so I would be really hard on myself. When I got older, my mom would talk about it a lot, and helped explain to me why I was like that. And now I understand fully.
How do you view social media?
F. I took pictures to accentuate my body, to get attention. I just wanted attention so bad. Now I'm way more protective. I appreciate my body way more than I used to. I know that it's a gift. I'm not useless like a rag. I am sacred.

Texto completo: Lets be honest. When it comes to religious conviction, President Donald Trump makes Vladimir Lenin look more observant than Pope Francis.

So should anyone be surprised that in his continuing efforts to woo Americas evangelical community, Trump has brought Florida-based television preacher Paula White into his administration to advise his Faith and Opportunity (emphasis on Opportunity) Initiative.

What would Jesus do? A well-timed forehead slap, perhaps?

Locals hereabout will recall Whites time in Tampa where she served as co-pastor, along with her now-former husband Randy White, of the Without Walls International Church.

It was not just a church without walls. It was also without much of a bookkeeper. The ministry eventually declared bankruptcy, despite hauling in as much as $150 million between 2004 to 2006. Salvation doesnt come cheap.

How do you blow through $150 million in alms? God only knows. And maybe the IRS.

Since departing from Without Walls a few years ago, White has been the senior pastor of City of Destiny near Orlando, offering the noted theologian an opportunity to sermonize her prosperity gospel to a whole flock of worshipers.

Along with other gospel grifters such as Joel Osteen, Kenneth Copeland and T.D. Jakes, White is a loyal acolyte of prosperity theology, which holds God wants his faithful to achieve wealth and health.

So much for: Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Little wonder that the High Priest of Palm Beach tapped White to assist him in convincing his evangelical lambs he really is a very prayerful chap.

White will have her work cut out for her in establishing Trumps biblical bona fides. After all, this is a thrice-married president who has bragged about his affairs, engaged in a sexual dalliance with a porn star, told an estimated 13,435 lies and misleading statements counted so far as of October by the Washington Post, played footsie with all manner of despots, stabbed Kurdish allies in the back, coddled white supremacists, separated families at the border and caged toddlers. What some people wont do for a Nobel Peace Prize.

Despite having all the moral comportment of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Trump was embraced by the evangelical wing of the Republican Party in 2016, largely on the candidates professed opposition to abortion and a promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

That was very nice, many of these evangelicals who so fervently defend the sanctity of life dont seem to give a sackcloth or an ash about caring for all these children after they are born when it comes to health care, or education, or gun violence. And there was precious little gnashing of teeth over defending family values as immigrant families were torn asunder simply for seeking a better life in the United States.

So much for: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

Clearly, White has the ideal pastoral pedigree to become Trumps in-house Mother Teresa of tithing. She also has been around the marital block three times. She retreats to her own mansion for meditation. And best of all, she owns an apartment in one of Trumps pricey New York properties. She is not just a White House confidant. Shes a customer, too. Perfect.

Youre probably thinking: Wait a minute. Across this vast land, filled with countless thoughtful, committed, compassionate men and women of deep, abiding spirituality representing an array of religious convictions, the very best Trump could come up with in selecting his Faith and Opportunity Initiative adviser was someone who regards the Good Book as little more than a stock prospectus? Isnt Jimmy Carter available?

The New York Times noted White might incur a tax problem if she does not fully divest herself from City of Destiny, since mingling her White House political work while still involved in the Orlando operation could threaten the churchs tax exempt status.

Apparently White will serve Trump as an unpaid adviser, which does seem awfully charitable. Still, forgive the sin of cynicism.

After a stint as Trumps soul whisperer, it is entirely likely White will be able to parlay her White House penance into lucrative book deals, television contracts and enhanced speaking fees. Maybe Vladimir Putin will call for some spiritual guidance. Rocket man, too.

For blessed are the opportunists, for theirs is the kingdom of cha-ching.

David Brooks: How to beat Trump on immigration

Texto completo: A wave of anxiety swept through Democratic ranks this week when a Times/Siena College poll suggested that Donald Trump is leading key Democrats in a bunch of swing states. How the heck is this guy still doing so well out there, after all that has happened?
The short answer is: immigration. Trump, like global populists everywhere, understands that we’re in the middle of a vast social experiment. Waves of migration are transforming societies across the globe. The U.S. will have no majority group in three decades. Sweden could be 20%-30% Muslim by 2050, according to Pew Research projections.
As the saying goes, everybody is now everywhere. We’re entering into states of interdependence with all sorts of people unlike ourselves. In the course of this, millions of people perceive that they are losing their country, losing their place, losing their culture.
Trump, like global populists everywhere, tells them: I’ll help you regain control.
By contrast, highly educated white progressives tell them: If you want to restrict immigration you’re probably a racist. As Eric Kaufmann notes in his book “Whiteshift,” 91.3% of white Hillary Clinton voters with graduate degrees said it’s racist to want less immigration for ethnic and cultural reasons.
Trump then turns around and says: See? These liberal elites want to silence you! They think you’re bigots! Game over.
If Trump opponents want to reach these voters, they need a better answer to one of the central challenges of our age: how to create a mass multicultural democracy where people feel at home.
This week I was at a Faith Angle Forum conference in France with a group of European and American scholars and journalists. I got a glimpse of that better answer.
The Europeans reminded me of something that is taboo here: that immigration is always, at the most personal level, a cultural encounter. It’s a person with one language and set of values interacting with a person with another language and set of values. When people meet in this way, they put their opinions, identities and way of life at risk. They might be changed by the encounter. The process is unsettling.
The crucial question becomes: Do the people in the encounter feel secure enough to learn from it rather than to react with anxiety and fear? Right now, we are asking millions of Americans to accept high immigration while they are already living with maximum insecurity. Their wages are declining, their families and communities are fragmenting, their churches are shrinking, government services are being cut, their values and national identity feel unstable.
Of course they are going to react with suspicion if suddenly on top of all this they begin to feel like strangers in their own place.
The lesson is that to create thick pluralistic society, you first have to help people embed in a secure base. That includes economic and health care security, but it also involves cultural and spiritual security. It involves offering people opportunities to embed in their local culture, to practice their particular faith, to live by local values that may seem alien to you and me.
Only people who are securely rooted in their own particularity are confident enough to enjoy the encounter with difference.
This is the paradox of pluralism: In order to get people to integrate with others you have to help them weave close communities with their own kind. Cosmopolitans never get this.
A person who is firmly rooted can go out and enjoy the adventure of pluralism. This is the second phase of thick pluralism. The person with the pluralist mindset acknowledges that God’s truth is radically dispersed. It is not contained in one tradition and community. The good life is only understood through a holistic journey across traditions.
The pluralist doesn’t see society as a competition for scarce resources, but as a joint voyage of discovery in search of life’s biggest answers. Pluralism offers us the chance, and the civic duty, to be a daring social explorer, venturing across subcultures, sometimes having the exciting experience of being the only one of you in the room, harvesting the wisdom embedded in other people’s lifeways. A key pluralist trait is curiosity, the opposite of anxiety.
Social exploration is a skill. It requires the ability to not merely tolerate difference, but to greet it with a generosity of spirit. Walking into each room confident in your convictions but humbly aware that they are not the only convictions. Being slow to take offense when somebody says the wrong thing, quick to forget the transgressions of others and honest in acknowledging your group’s past wrongs.
The conversations at the Faith Angle Forum reminded me that in a pluralistic society, institutions like schools, companies and neighborhoods have to be structured to offer both kinds of experience: bonding experience within your own tradition to create rootedness and also bridging experience that offers journeys of curiosity across different moral ecosystems.
Conservatives tend to emphasize the value of being rooted in place. Progressives tend to celebrate living across difference. Life is miserable, and a nation is broken, unless you do both.

Texto completo: No. 3 Ohio State announced Friday it will not play star defensive end Chase Young against Maryland this weekend amid concerns he violated NCAA rules by taking a loan last year from someone he describes as a "family friend."
The surprising move was disclosed in the team's status report and depth chart for Saturday's game. Ohio State said only that Young was being held out because of a "possible NCAA issue from last year" the athletic department is "looking into." The school did not elaborate or say how long he might be out.
Young, however, took to Twitter a short time later.
"I made a mistake last year by accepting a loan from a family friend I've known since the summer before my freshman year at OSU," he wrote on his verified Twitter account Friday morning. "I repaid it in full last summer and I'm working with the University and NCAA to get back on the field as soon as possible."
Young leads the nation in sacks with 13.5 after a dominant performance two weeks ago against Wisconsin that thrust him into the Heisman Trophy race. The junior is projected to be one of the first players taken in next year's NFL draft.
The Buckeyes are 42-point favorites against Maryland and will be heavily favored next week against Rutgers whether Young plays or not.
College basketball
Memphis' Wiseman has temporary restraining order to play >> Memphis center James Wiseman has a temporary restraining order to play while the heralded freshman fights an NCAA ruling that he's ineligible to play for coach Penny Hardaway and the Tigers.
Memphis issued a statement, less than an hour before the No. 14 Tigers played Illinois-Chicago, saying it is working with NCAA staff to fully restore Wiseman's eligibility.
Wiseman was the No. 1 recruit nationally and is projected as the top pick overall in the 2020 NBA draft.
Memphis says Wiseman was declared eligible by the NCAA in May. More information and investigation led to information that Hardaway, who was then coach of East High School, gave $11,500 in moving expenses to help Wiseman's family move from Nashville to Memphis in the summer of 2017.
Wiseman played for East High as a junior and helped Hardaway win his third straight Tennessee Class AAA title.
Track and field
Nike will look into allegations of abuse by runner Cain >> Nike will investigate allegations of abuse by runner Mary Cain while she was a member of Alberto Salazar's training group.
Cain joined the disbanded Nike Oregon Project run by Salazar in 2013, soon after competing in the 1,500-meter final at track and field's world championships when she was 17.
Now 23, Cain tells The New York Times in a video essay that under Salazar's direction she was told to lose weight and he created an "arbitrary number of 114 pounds." Cain says she started having suicidal thoughts and cutting herself.
Nike says in a statement that these are "deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before." The company adds it takes this matter "extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes."
Olympics
USOPC to add athlete reps in wake of Nassar sex abuse >> The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee will add athletes to its board and enhance its oversight of individual sports organizations in a package of reforms stemming from the Larry Nassar sex-abuse scandal.
The reforms were approved Thursday and go into effect in January. They come with Congress proposing its own, harsher, set of changes, after the scandal exposed the USOPC as deficient when it came to protecting and ensuring the safety of Olympic athletes.
Athletes will hold 33 percent of the board seats. The U.S. Olympians and Paralympians Association and Athletes Advisory Council will collaborate to choose the leaders.
Pro hockey
Bettman: NHL set to return to Europe >> NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman says the NHL plans to return to Europe for games in the next two years.
Citing huge demand, Bettman said that the Boston Bruins and the Nashville Predators will open the regular season next year with a game in Prague. The Colorado Avalanche and the Columbus Blue Jackets will play a couple of games in the Finnish capital of Helsinki.
Bettman did not specify dates for the games.

Think 'OK, boomer' is new? Wrong. Gen X hated you all first

Texto completo: Looking at history, the young and old have rarely respected each other.
Socrates kvetched about kids' "disrespect for elders," as did the Old Testament. You wouldn't have to command children to "honor thy father and thy mother" if it came naturally.
But today, a shocking new tactic has been deployed in the timeless war between generations. As baby boomers impugn millennials' addiction to avocado toast or Gen Z's worries about staggering college debt, the youth dismiss it with a casual retort: "OK, boomer."
The phrase has popped up on social media for months, but this week it hit the big-time with long dissertations in The New York Times and the Washington Post.
"There's not much I can personally do to undo political corruption or fix Congress," 18-year-old college student Nina Kasman said. "It's mostly old white men boomers who don't represent the majority of generations."
To her credit, Kasman is making coin on the issue, selling "OK, boomer" merch on the internet.
Those "old white men" aren't taking it lying down. A New York radio host claimed that "'boomer' is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry OK, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new."
The 60-year-old's tweet went viral and earned approximately eleventy billion responses of "OK, boomer."
Blaming the post-WWII generation for all the world's ills is nothing new. Gen Xers like myself pioneered the technique in the '90s only to watch millennials and Gen Zers co-opt it for their own cohorts.
They're even using the same arguments. We're the first generation to have a lower quality of life than the generation before, college is too expensive and the climate is going to kill us. Yadda, yadda, yadda.
It stings a bit to see my generation skipped over, but we haven't yet had the chance to lead. Every president since Clinton has been a boomer, as are the main contenders for the Democratic primary. Actually, Bernie is pre-boomer, born before Pearl Harbor was bombed and socialism was discredited.
Of course, defining an entire generation by their caricatures is always overbroad. Plenty of hippie-era college kids voted for Nixon, just as many Gen Xers didn't wear three layers of flannel and listen to grunge. (I preferred shoegaze.) The mass culture these groups spawned, however, helps define them in aggregate.
After the Greatest Generation survived the Great Depression and returned from a bloody world war, they sought a quiet sanctuary in suburbia, sparing their kids such pain. The boomers decided such a life was boring and inauthentic, and tried to replace it with a Summer of Love to usher in the Age of Aquarius. It didn't go so well.
Gen X was sold the boomers' failed utopia throughout our youth but never bought it. Our childhood was infused with the wreckage wrought by hippies and yuppies. Draft dodgers and dead rock stars were lifted up as idols while our kiddie shows toggled between LSD trips and eco-apocalypse.
We watched the failure of the War on Poverty, Nixon, Ford and Carter — not to mention our broken homes. It didn't make us cynical as much as skeptical; institutions were expected to fail more than they succeeded, and we acted accordingly.
So, when these millennial and Gen-Z whippersnappers blame everything on the olds, remember that Gen X was there first. You don't get to right all the wrongs until we've had our chance to fix things. Or, more likely, just screw it up in a new way.
Once your kids have the chance to mutter "OK, X-er" at our policies, then you can have your shot. In the meantime, get off our lawns.

Nike sets out to discredit Cain

Texto completo: As the people who were there confirmed Mary Cain's story, the company Cain said endorsed an abusive system tried to undermine her credibility. Cain, one of the best American high school athletes ever, said yesterday that her Nike-paid coach, Alberto Salazar, emotionally and physically abused her.
Cain told the New York Times on Thursday that Salazar and his cronies aggressively pushed her to lose weight through undereating, birth control pills, and diuretics. That set off a spiral that caused Cain, still just 23 now, to lose her period for years, break five bones, and start cutting herself.
Nike called the story "deeply troubling" before launching into its attempt to discredit Cain. "These...allegations have not been raised by Mary or her parents before," the company said in a statement.
"Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year, and had not raised these concerns as part of that process." This is offensive. Nike is the most powerful entity in running, and Salazar is its most powerful and successful coach in this country, or was before he was banned from the sport for doping violations this fall. Her story is about how Salazar took emotional control over her.
Salazar took the same route, telling the Oregonian that "Neither of her parents, nor Mary, raised any of the issues that she now suggests occurred while I was coaching her. To be clear, I never encouraged her, or worse yet, shamed her, to maintain an unhealthy weight.
"Mary at times struggled to find and maintain her ideal performance and training weight," Salazar said Thursday. He also made sure to send a reporter a screenshot of an April 2019 text from Cain planning a return to the Oregon Project.
Cain confirmed Friday morning that she was looking into an NOP return earlier this year, writing that she "wanted Alberto to still take me back. I still love him."
"When we let people emotionally break us, we crave more than anything their very approval," she said.
Nike added that it "will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes." That investigation should take about five minutes, as Cain's former teammates and coaches came forward Thursday and Friday to confirm the substance and spirit of her story.
Kara Goucher won a world championships silver medal under Salazar but has become an outspoken whistleblower about his methods in recent years. She said Thursday that she witnessed Salazar kick Amy Yoder-Begley out of the Oregon Project for being "too fat" and having "the biggest butt on the starting line."
Goucher's husband, Adam, was also a professional runner under Salazar who has since turned against him. Adam Goucher said Thursday night that Alberto and an assistant told Kara's mother and sister that she was too fat despite running a world-class marathon after giving birth.
Steve Magness was an assistant coach for the Oregon Project at the beginning of the decade; much of the evidence behind Salazar's suspension is that he illegally doped Magness to see if a certain supplement was effective. He said Thursday night that Salazar was obsessed with getting an unnamed NOP athlete to lose weight despite lab data saying it would be unsafe for her to do so. "I don't care what the science says! Her butt is too big," Magness says Salazar told him.
Magness also claims that Salazar called Jenny Simpson "way too soft and pudgy" in 2012. (Simpson won world championship gold in 2011, silver in 2013, and Olympic bronze in 2016, among other evidence that Salazar was wrong.)
Cam Levins was a star college athlete, struggled intermittently as a pro under Salazar's group, and broke the Canadian record in the marathon after leaving. He tweeted at Cain on Thursday night that "our coaching staff was obsessed with your weight loss... I knew because they spoke of it openly among other athletes."
Alberto Salazar did not respond to an email from the Daily News, although the Times reported that he "denied many of Mary Cain's claims, and said he had supported her health and welfare."
Salazar has long cultivated an image in the running press as someone who truly believes he's doing the right thing, even when it seems outrageous or troubling to the rest of the world. But sometimes, when someone denies something that's obviously true, they're just lying.

Texto completo: In the article titled "New Mexico's Oil Boom: Bounty for One of the Country's Poorest States," the New York Times wildly missed the mark. As a longtime resident of New Mexico who lives in Santa Fe and has worked in our oil and gas producing areas, it was infuriating to see our complex state reduced to snide comments and shockingly reductive representations of the rich dynamics in our state – especially given that the topic is so serious. We're fighting for the future of New Mexico's air, land and water at a time when the very fabric of our economy is changing. The Times is wrong to focus only on the divide between the northern and southern parts of our state – without accurately representing either group.
For three years, CAVU has worked to build bridges between environmental and oil and gas communities by focusing on what unites us. The purpose of this work is to decrease the divisions in our state – whether they be between urban and rural, southern and northern – and increase understanding.
The Times article quotes organizations in NM that focus on utilities and do not work directly on oil and gas issues. These groups are specifically geared toward reducing greenhouse gases from our utilities. We can't address only one piece of the puzzle. What about transportation, plastics and other aspects of our economy that will – for better or worse – be relying on oil and gas for decades?
There is a fundamental question we as environmental organizations need to ask ourselves. How do we work to address climate change while also benefiting from the oil and gas industry? The fact remains that the oil and gas industry makes significant contributions to our state's budget. We need to diversify our economy to ensure varied and stable sources of income. In order to do so, we need to leverage this oil and gas boom to bring all of us into the 21st century.
Furthermore, it is incredibly important to give respect to the men and women who work in the oil and gas fields. They work long and hard hours in rough conditions, usually away from their families, living in so called "man camps" because there isn't enough housing for them or their families. While those of us that work on climate change want to see our state move forward to a clean energy economy, these people will continue to do what they see as a meaningful service for our country.
We need to remember that in order to make meaningful and lasting change, we need to be willing to see people who disagree with us as people – not objects of an opposing view. When the Times says that people in Lea and Eddy counties feel that we in Santa Fe don't care or understand them, I don't blame them. But their feelings are aimed at the wrong people.
The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA) has an incredible opportunity to be a leader in innovative technological advances that could make a BIG difference in the venting, leaking and flaring of methane – the most potent greenhouse gas resulting from oil and gas operations. NMOGA could loudly and proudly support the governor's process for developing statewide, comprehensive methane rules and acknowledge the benefits of doing so. If their goal is to be part of the change New Mexicans want, they could choose to leverage their influence to bring people together, rather than to widen the divide. Thanks to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has made it a priority to bring people together, collaboration is happening right now. For our state to truly benefit, we must move beyond the finger pointing and really start doing the exciting work of making our oil and gas communities safer and integrated into our state and our future. I encourage the New York Times to dig deeper next time to tell the bigger story or explore what we can do to bridge the divide. There's so much more here.

To the Editor:
Re "Bloomberg Bid for Presidency Starts to Rustle" (front page, Nov. 8):
Michael Bloomberg may be the Democrats' best and only chance to capture the White House in 2020, and I'm super-psyched that the former three-term mayor of New York City appears to be throwing his hat into the ring!
In this writer's opinion there is no candidate on the Democratic side who can beat Donald Trump, if he survives impeachment. Joe Biden is too old, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too far to the left and too angry, and Mayor Pete is just too young and inexperienced.
Michael Bloomberg was the best mayor that New York ever had. He would finance most of his own campaign and not be beholden to any individual or corporate entities. He stands among the strongest proponents of gun control laws and is a huge supporter of the environment and a woman's right to choose.
These are the very qualities America needs after almost three years of Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy would energize the Democratic base and attract huge numbers of independent voters. I like Mike!
Henry A. Lowenstein

To the Editor:
I admire Michael Bloomberg's work to strengthen gun control. However, to be successful in the presidential election, a candidate will have to excite young people, women and minorities. Mr. Bloomberg will not be able to do that.
David Atwood
Houston
To the Editor:
The commentary on Michael Bloomberg's potential run for the presidency has been all about the politics: Can he win the nomination? Whose candidacies will he hurt? Is he too old? Is it too late? Can he beat Donald Trump?
Instead of focusing on the horse race, I think it would be instructive to consider what a Bloomberg presidency might look like -- sound management practices, evidence-driven policies, middle-of-the-road politics, fiscal responsibility. For a change, let's talk about who would be the best president, not the ebb and flow of the race.

Texto completo: In the wake of distance runner Mary Cain's allegations of abuse during her time with the Nike Oregon Project track club and coach Alberto Salazar, Nike announced Friday amid a flood of criticism that it will investigate the since-shuttered distance running program.
In a New York Times video op-ed released Thursday, Cain, 23, described how a 'systemic crisis in women's sports and at Nike' left one of track and field's brightest young stars with a broken body and spirit. Cain joined the Nike Oregon Project shortly after Salazar contacted her at age 16. Cain said Salazar obsessed over her weight and forced her to take medication, some of which was banned. Cain said the weight loss led to her having bone disease, losing her period for three years and, ultimately, having suicidal thoughts and cutting herself.
On social media, several former members of the Oregon Project confirmed or added to Cain's accounts of Salazar's fixation on weight. One former runner, Olympian Amy Begley, said Salazar kicked her out of the club in 2011 after saying she was too fat and 'had the biggest butt on the starting line.'
In a statement Friday, Nike said that it was not aware of Cain's allegations and that Cain had sought to train under Salazar this year.
'These are deeply troubling allegations which have not been raised by Mary or her parents before,' a Nike spokesman said in an emailed statement. 'Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto's team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process. We take the allegations extremely seriously and will launch an immediate investigation to hear from former Oregon Project athletes. At Nike we seek to always put the athlete at the center of everything we do, and these allegations are completely inconsistent with our values.'
In a thread on Twitter, Cain confirmed she had been in contact with Salazar in the spring.
'I wanted closure, wanted an apology for never helping me when I was cutting, and in my own, sad, never-fully healed heart, wanted Alberto to still take me back,' Cain wrote. 'I still loved him. Because when we let people emotionally break us, we crave more than anything their very approval.'
In their spring meeting, Cain said, Salazar opened up about personal 'struggles,' which Cain took as a sign of possible reconciliation. When they fell out of touch over the summer, she believed Salazar only cared about her performance, not her as a person.
'Then, after the USADA report dropped, I felt this quick and sudden sense of release,' Cain wrote.
Cain's allegations became the latest scandal Nike, Salazar and his former club face. In late September, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency banned Salazar and Jeffrey Brown, his personal physician, for four years for administering a banned substance, tampering with the doping control process and trafficking testosterone. Salazar said immediately after the ruling that he plans to appeal. Nike subsequently shut down the Oregon Project.
USADA's report on the case included a 2009 email exchange between Brown and Nike CEO Mark Parker in which Brown detailed the results of an experiment with a topical hormone gel and Parker thanked him for the update and asked whether there were 'other topical hormones that would create more dramatic results.'
Parker announced in October that he will step down in January to become the company's executive chairman. He told CNBC his decision 'had absolutely nothing to do with' Salazar's ban or the Oregon Project.
Early this decade, Cain emerged as one of the most precocious stars track and field had seen. In 2012, in the summer after her sophomore year of high school, she set a girls' U.S. high school record by running the 1,500 meters in 4:11.01 at the junior world championships in Barcelona. She was the youngest American athlete to represent the United States at the world championships. By 17, she had set six American junior records and won a national indoor title in the 1,500. She set her sights on the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, at which point she would have been 20.
Cain's partnership with Salazar, by her account, cut short her aspirations. In the Times video, Cain said Salazar demanded she weigh 114 pounds, an 'arbitrary' target. Cain said Salazar gave her birth control medication and diuretics " which are banned in track and field " to control her weight. Cain acknowledged weight matters in distance running but said Salazar's methods were unhealthy.
The weight loss, Cain said, disrupted her development. She lost her period for three years, which led to a lack of estrogen production, which led to osteoporosis. She broke five bones, she said. With her performance diminished and her body weakened, Cain started to cut herself, she said. Because all the officials at the Nike Oregon Project were friendly with Salazar, Cain said, she felt she couldn't turn to anyone for help.
After a disappointing performance at a 2015 meet, Cain recalled in the Times video, she huddled under a tent with fellow competitors during a rainstorm. Salazar screamed at her. She broke down and told him she was cutting herself. Salazar, she said, responded by telling her he was tired and wanted to go to sleep.
In a statement to the Oregonian, Salazar denied that he mistreated Cain.
'Mary's father is a medical doctor, and both of her parents were deeply involved in her training, competition and health throughout the period she was coached by me,' Salazar said, according to the paper. 'For example, Mary's father consulted on medications and supplements Mary used during her time at the NOP. Neither of her parents nor Mary raised any of the issues that she now suggests occurred while I was coaching her. To be clear, I never encouraged her, or worse yet, shamed her, to maintain an unhealthy weight.'
But several athletes Salazar trained at the club backed Cain's account. Canadian runner Cam Levins apologized to Cain through his Twitter account for not supporting her when they were teammates the Oregon Project.
'I knew that our coaching staff was obsessed with your weight loss, emphasizing it as if it were the single thing standing in the way of great performances,' Levins wrote. 'I knew because they spoke of it openly among other athletes.'
Adam and Kara Goucher, a married couple, both competed for the track club and have levied criticism at Salazar and Nike since leaving. Kara asked Nike on Twitter to come to her during its investigation 'because I have stories to match all of Mary's claims and so much more.' Adam wrote on his Twitter feed that the way club officials and coached talked about women's bodies was 'disgusting.'
He recalled the 2011 Boston Marathon, which took place seven months after Kara gave birth. After Kara finished fifth, Adam said, Salazar approached Kara's mother and said: 'Don't tell Kara, but she is still too heavy. She needs to lose her baby weight if she wants to be fast again.'
Steve Magness, a former Oregon Project assistant coach who was a crucial whistleblower in USADA's case against the club, confirmed Cain's accounts on his Twitter feed. Magness said Salazar would encourage athletes to leave meals hungry and would rebuke them for eating certain foods, such as hamburgers. He called Salazar 'obsessed' with weight and said Salazar tried to get athletes to take 'shady' supplements.
'I've witnessed the harm and damage that such a culture creates,' Magness wrote. 'It's lasting mental health issues. That's the issue. The culture made it where crazy is normal.'

Empathy is good, but what if you care too much? Dr. Judith Orloff has advice for empaths

Texto completo: There's a cost to caring too much.
Two prominent mental health counselors – a resilience expert at an Ivy League college and a megachurch pastor – died by suicide in September. At the 2017 U. S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Health Means Business summit, Arianna Huffington, sleep evangelist and author of “The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time,” said people who toil in the charitable space often have the most trouble detaching from work and, well, going to bed.
Meanwhile, Justin Phillips, a mother who lost her son to a drug overdose, partnered with agency Venables Bell & Partners, to start the #chooseempathy movement. She founded Overdose Lifeline to raise awareness that addiction is not a choice and requires empathetic responses.
Dr. Judith Orloff, a psychiatrist and self-described empath, agrees society needs more empathy given the rising rates of addiction, suicide and mental illness, among other challenges. But she cautions those who choose to be empathic – or find it comes naturally – about the need to care for themselves first.

The New York Times best-selling author's new book, "Thriving as an Empath: 365 Days of Self-Care for Sensitive People" (Sounds True publishing), is now in stores.
Here, she talks with USA TODAY health policy reporter Jayne O'Donnell, who calls herself an "overempathizer. "
Question: How do you know if you are an empath? What are the character traits?
Dr. Judith Orloff: Ordinary empathy is the ability to feel someone else’s pain as well as their joy, the ability for us to be open-hearted. It's such a beautiful trait. Being an empath, however, goes further. Empaths have extremely sensitive neurological systems and don’t have the usual filters that other people have, so they feel things intensely and often are emotional sponges who take on other people’s stress if they don’t learn how to set boundaries and practice other self-care techniques . . . Most empaths are introverts like myself, but some are extroverts who love socializing but still need to decompress afterwards to take care of themselves.
As part of my research on empaths, I developed a 20-question self-assessment test in my earlier book, "The Empath’s Survival Guide," to determine if you are an empath. Some of the questions include: Have I been labeled as overly sensitive? (in a derogatory way). Do crowds drain me, and do I need a lot of alone time to replenish myself? Do I take on other people’s stress or emotions? Do I replenish myself in nature? Am I super-sensitive to noise, smells and excessive talking?
Empaths have many special challenges and also many gifts.
Q: There's a clear need for more empathy in our country, isn't there?
Orloff: I believe empathy is the most precious trait in human nature. We need more of it in our country and in the world. Empathy is the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes so you can see their point of view. Empathy is so powerful because it opens our hearts. It allows us to try to understand another person’s position, even if we don’t particularly like them or if we disagree on an issue. This gives us the best chance of successfully communicating with them and resolving differences.
Q: But there are risks in caring too much, aren’t there?
Orloff: Yes, I’ve seen many of my patients, including empaths and all sensitive people, care too much and become burned out by empathy overload – or get involved with addictions, including substances, food and sex to numb themselves out. In my psychotherapy practice, there has been an epidemic of empathic patients consulting me who are exhausted, anxious, depressed and overwhelmed by added stress in their personal lives, which is aggravated by our world’s non-stop stress.
Arianna Huffington reports that over two-thirds of doctors in the U. S. say they are burned out, depressed or both! Plus the general suicide rate in our country just keeps going up. Those in the helping professions have trouble turning stress off so they also tend to experience impaired sleep and increased anxiety.
Q: What are the most effective ways for empaths to establish boundaries?
Orloff: Taking adequate alone time is essential to decompress. When my empath patients go nonstop in their jobs or as parents – without periodically slowing down – they risk chronic exhaustion, anxiety and overwhelm. Scheduling mini-breaks in your life to take a few deep breaths, spending some quiet time without phone calls, demands or over-stimulation, taking a walk or meditating for even a few minutes will break the momentum of stress and prevent sensory overload.
Also I teach all my patients that “no is a complete sentence. ”
Shouldn’t we all try to be better listeners and responders to those going through hard times?
Orloff: Being a caring listener is one of the great empathic gifts we can give others. But we don’t have to listen for hours on end to be effective. Giving someone your caring attention for five to 10 minutes can be very potent, as opposed to getting hooked into repetitive two-hour phone conversations that wear you out. “I love you and I will be thinking of you” is a wonderful thing to say after responding to the person for a limited time. Also, I recommend having short check-ins with the person. A technique I suggest in "Thriving as an Empath" is the “3 Minute Phone Call. ” This is when you tell the person you’re available for this period of time and you want to support them.
As an empathic person, you adore giving, but what I hope my book will provide you with are strategies to give in healthy ways – but also practice self-care so you can be a balanced, happy person.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - A senior American diplomat has written a highly critical assessment of the Trump administration's abrupt withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria last month, a decision that paved the way for an attack on U.S.-allied forces in the area, officials said Thursday.
In an internal memo, William Roebuck, the top American diplomat in northern Syria, takes the Trump administration to task for not doing more to prevent Turkey's invasion or protect the Kurds, who fought alongside U.S. forces in the battle against the Islamic State group, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter.
One of the officials described the memo, which was obtained and first revealed by The New York Times, as "lengthy and harsh." The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Roebuck's memo highlights how President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the troops was deeply divisive, even within his own administration. The move was widely criticized by Democrats and Republicans as abandoning a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State.
Turkey invaded days after Trump ordered the U.S. special forces to leave.
In the memo quoted by the Times, Roebuck said there was no way to know if more pressure on Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, would have stopped the operation.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not. But we won't know because we didn't try," the Times quoted Roebuck as writing.
Trump's ordered withdrawal from the northeast has been somewhat tempered by the deployment of forces to protect oil fields in Kurdish-held areas.
GM selling shuttered factory
in Ohio to electric truck maker
TOLEDO, Ohio - General Motors is selling a massive assembly plant it shut down earlier this year in Ohio, a closing that drew threats and scolding from President Donald Trump, to a newly formed company that said Thursday it intends to begin making electric trucks by late 2020.
The company called Lordstown Motors Corp. plans to hire 400 production workers at the outset, but said it still needs more investors before manufacturing can begin.
GM had employed 4,500 people at the factory near Youngstown just two years ago before it began cutting production and eventually in March ended more than 50 years of car manufacturing there, part of a major restructuring plan.
Terms of the sale and the investors who are behind the deal weren't disclosed by the privately held Lordstown Motors.
French leader laments NATO's 'brain death' due to US actions
BRUSSELS - French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that a lack of U.S. leadership is causing the "brain death" of the NATO military alliance, insisting in an interview published Thursday that the European Union must step up and start acting as a strategic world power.
Macron's public criticism of the state of the world's biggest military alliance was rejected by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, setting the scene for a possible showdown in London next month when NATO leaders meet.
"What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of NATO," Macron told The Economist magazine. He said the United States under President Donald Trump appears to be "turning its back on us."
North Carolina no longer an outlier on sex and consent
GREENSBORO, N.C. - North Carolina's governor has signed a sexual assault bill that says women can revoke consent during sex.
Gov. Roy Cooper said in a news release Thursday that he had signed the bill, which undoes a 1979 court decision that made North Carolina the only state where women can't revoke consent.
The law also undoes a court ruling from 2008 that said sexual assault laws don't apply to people who were incapacitated because of their own action as victims, such as by taking drugs or alcohol. It also increases penalties for child abusers.
The law goes into effect Dec. 1.
Both houses of the legislature approved the bill unanimously last week. Cooper says the bipartisan legislation "will help more people seek justice against abusers."
Okla. woman in failure-to-protect case to be freed
OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma woman who has served 15 years in prison for failing to report her boyfriend, who served just two years for abusing her children, is scheduled to be released from custody.
The Oklahoma Department of Corrections says Gov. Kevin Stitt has signed the commutation sentence of Tondalao Hall and she is to be released Friday.
Her release comes about after the state Pardon and Parole Board voted unanimously to recommend that Stitt commute her sentence to time served.
Hall's ex-boyfriend, Robert Braxton, pleaded guilty to abusing the children and was released on probation after two years in jail.
The disparity of the sentences outraged women's rights groups and brought further attention to Oklahoma's high rate of incarceration, particularly of women.
Governor of Texas to open homeless camp in Austin
AUSTIN, Texas - Texas' Republican governor said Thursday that he is creating a homeless campsite on 5 acres of state land of the outskirts of downtown in the capital of Austin, escalating a battle with the city's liberal leaders over people living on the streets.
Greg Abbott's announcement was met with a mix of muted welcoming and accusations of political posturing from Democrats who run the state capital around the Texas Governor's Mansion, where Abbott has spent months lashing out at the city's homelessness problem on Twitter.
Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the campsite will have portable restrooms and hand-washing stations. He said it will also provide access to homeless case workers and health care providers until permanent sheltering opens.
In China: A court sentenced nine fentanyl traffickers Thursday in a case that is the culmination of a rare collaboration between Chinese and U.S. law enforcement.
Liu Yong was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, while Jiang Juhua and Wang Fengxi were sentenced to life in prison. Six other members of the operation received lesser sentences, ranging from six months to 10 years. Death sentences are almost always commuted to life in prison after the reprieve.
Working off a 2017 tip from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about an online drug vendor who went by the name Diana, Chinese police busted the drug ring based in the northern Chinese city of Xingtai.

Texto completo: An acclaimed documentary hits Amazon. And a recent revival of "The King and I" airs as part of PBS's "Great Performances."
What's Streaming
ONE CHILD NATION (2019) Stream on Amazon. The filmmakers Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang explore China's long-running one-child policy in this searing documentary, which was applauded at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The film focuses on the toll that the policy took during its decades of enforcement (China embraced the policy in the late 1970s and ended it in 2015). It uses Wang's own family and story as a way in, combining her narration with interviews with people who felt the effects of the policy in different, troubling ways. It's an emotionally intense topic that Wang and Zhang address "with clarity, concision and strategically restrained outrage," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. "I've watched 'One Child Nation' twice, at times through tears," she added, "but there's nothing in it that's gratuitously exploitative. It is instead an essential account of one battle in the continuing war over women's bodies, one that, Wang forcefully observes, is in no way limited to China."
SEE Stream on Apple TV Plus. It begins with a birth: A pair of children born into a society that they can see, but that can't see them. That is the premise of this action-drama series, set in a world where a virus wiped out most of the human population and rendered all the survivors blind. The story picks up centuries after that cataclysm, with the birth of the two children, whose ability to see puts them at risk of being killed by a tribe that views eyesight as a sin. Luckily for them, their father is played by Jason Momoa -- so they at least have a mighty guardian. The series was created and written by the "Peaky Blinders" creator Steven Knight. It exhibits, Mike Hale wrote in his review for The Times, "a ripe ridiculousness that's almost endearing."
FIRE IN PARADISE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Exactly a year has passed since the fire that would grow into the deadliest wildfire in California's history first started burning. This documentary presents interviews with survivors of the Camp Fire and some of those who fought it.
What's on TV
GREAT PERFORMANCES: 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). A film of the 2015 Lincoln Center Theater revival of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "The King and I" is the latest entry in PBS's "Great Performances" series. Directed by Bartlett Sher, the production pairs Kelli O'Hara and Ken Watanabe in the familiar roles of a British schoolteacher working in Siam and a Siamese king. The heirloom show's colonialist elements will also be familiar to many -- and they are not left unaddressed. Sher "works from within vintage material, coaxing shadowy emotional depths to churn up a surface that might otherwise seem shiny and slick," Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The Times. The musical's lush, familiar ballads, Brantley added, "acquire freshening nuance and anchoring conviction here."

Texto completo: One of the broadcaster's employees, Samira Ahmed, has taken it to court, accusing it of paying a man much more for the same work.
LONDON -- For the past several days, BBC managers and executives have trooped to a small hearing room in central London to defend the broadcaster's decision to pay a woman a fraction of what it paid a man for what she argues is similar work.
The testimony, which concluded Thursday, has been long and drawn out, comparing in colorless detail the company's appraisal of a well-known female TV host's work and a well-known male TV host's work. The BBC's position: Her work and her profile were not equal to her male colleague's.
It is just the latest episode in a two-year drama that has put the BBC on the ropes because of criticism of its pay practices.
The BBC is being sued for back pay by Samira Ahmed, who argues that she was underpaid for years hosting a program called "Newswatch." Ms. Ahmed was paid 440 pounds an episode in 2012 when she started presenting the weekly program, which discusses audience responses to BBC news coverage.
Ms. Ahmed says her work is comparable to that of Jeremy Vine, a colleague who hosts a program that allows viewers to sound off over entertainment programs on the network. Mr. Vine was paid £3,000 an episode when Ms. Ahmed started.
British law stipulates that employees should receive equal pay for equal work.
The broadcaster, which is publicly funded, has been under heavy scrutiny of late over equal-pay practices. Just last year, Carrie Gracie abruptly quit her role as China editor over being paid less than her male peers.
In Ms. Ahmed's case, the BBC has defended itself by playing down her profile and contributions, as well as the significance of one of its own programs. It disputes her characterization of her work as similar to Mr. Vine's.
"Jeremy Vine and Samira Ahmed perform very different roles in their work for the BBC," Gautam Rangarajan, the BBC's director of strategy, said in a statement submitted to the hearing. "Jeremy has decades of visibility in high-profile programs that span both non-news and news output."
"Samira Ahmed is an experienced journalist but with a lower public profile and narrower focus of expertise than Jeremy Vine," he added. But Mr. Rangarajan also noted that "the BBC recognizes that broadcasting itself creates recognition."
In several days of hearings, BBC managers testified that because Mr. Vine's program, "Points of View," dealt with lighthearted entertainment, rather than news, he could command more of a fee because he was expected to be "a friend" to the viewer.
For example, if a viewer wrote in to Mr. Vine's program, and the viewer's question was answered with a statement from BBC management, Mr. Vine "would roll his eyes, as if to say, 'I've heard all that before,"' Simon Miller, a producer for the show, said in a statement to the hearing.
"Although that was in the script, it was believable coming from him," Mr. Miller said. "He was the audience's friend when he was presenting and interviewing."
Ms. Ahmed's program, on the other hand, "is a journalistic program, which adopts an interrogative approach with a serious tone," James Mallet, a "Newswatch" producer, said in his witness statement.
This difference applies across all programs, said Roger Leatham, the director of business affairs for BBC Studios Production.
"None of this is to denigrate the skills of factual presenters and journalists. They can also be highly skilled and excellent at their jobs," Mr. Leatham said in his statement submitted to the hearing.
"They may work as hard as, and sometimes harder than, non-news presenters, but the market for their services operates differently and always has done from the days of Morecambe and Wise and before," he added, referring to a British comedy duo popular in the 1970s.
Over the course of the hearing Ms. Ahmed sat on one side, flanked by her supporters, including Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, and Ms. Gracie, the former China editor. The BBC's representatives sat on the other, surrounded by lawyers and boxes of papers.
The hearing was conducted by the Central London Employment Tribunal, and it is not known when the three-judge panel will deliver a ruling.
Mark Thompson, who was director-general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012, is now chief executive of The New York Times Company.
Ms. Ahmed's complaint adds to the continued scrutiny focused on the BBC since 2017, when it was forced to publish the pay bands of its most highly paid employees, after attracting criticism for seemingly lavish salaries it was heaping on some stars. Relatively few women were in the highest pay bands, the report showed.
It was through this report that Ms. Gracie discovered she was being paid less than men who were also regional editors. She took her complaint to her supervisors and was offered a raise, but not one that lifted her to the same level as her male peers. Ms. Gracie resigned in protest.
The BBC eventually apologized in June last year and gave Ms. Gracie her back pay, but not before executives were grilled before a parliamentary committee examining the BBC's pay practices.
Furthermore, the BBC has been dealing with the fallout from the pay report. It received almost 300 grievance complaints, and about 120 women are seeking to bring a collective case against unequal pay.
The wider debate on women's pay was highlighted again last week when Britain's Office for National Statistics published figures that showed that the gender pay gap for the country had only marginally decreased from 2018 to 2019.

Texto completo: When I first saw the Mona Lisa, a friend and I shuffled through a cluster of tourists on a crisp winter afternoon in the Louvre. We snapped photos, and we gazed at the painting as well as we could from behind the barriers that held us more than a body's length away, peering through the thick layer of glass at the 2.5-foot-tall painting.
Then, not to agitate the dozens of spectators waiting in line behind us, we scuttled off. The whole ordeal took probably 60 seconds, not counting the many minutes we had already spent waiting in line. Of the things I’ve crossed off my bucket list, I’ll admit it wasn’t the most thrilling. But it was significant nonetheless.
Now the Mona Lisa, as an international destination for eager tourists, is under attack. The New York Times’ art critic Jason Farago argued this week, “It’s Time to Take Down the Mona Lisa.” Why? “The Mona Lisa is a security hazard, an educational obstacle, and not even a satisfying bucket-list item.” Adding insult to injury, Farago declares the enigmatic lady “the Kim Kardashian of 16th-century Italian portraiture.”
Some 30,000 people see the Mona Lisa each day, jamming up the museum’s traffic in impossibly long lines just to spend moments with the famous painting. According to the Louvre, 80% of visitors come for the Mona Lisa, and each one spends an average of 3 to 4 minutes with the painting, while they spend only 50 seconds looking at it.
Farago argues that it’s not only a crowd generator, it's also an educational obstacle: “If curators think that they are inspiring the next generation of art lovers, they are in fact doing the opposite. People come out of obligation, and leave discouraged.” He’s right that viewing the slight masterpiece is not the most satisfying experience, but that doesn't mean it's not valuable.
The Mona Lisa is perhaps the most recognizable piece of art in history. Seeing it at the Louvre, albeit through a layer of glass, has immeasurable value for curious viewers from all over the world.
When I visited the Louvre, viewing the Mona Lisa was one of my least memorable experiences. But it played a very large role in getting me there in the first place. Each year, the Mona Lisa draws in millions of spectators who will also have the opportunity to view more than 35,000 other works of art.
The Louvre boasts several other paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, including his famous St. John the Baptist and the Virgin of the Rocks.
Come for the Mona Lisa. Stay for the rest of the great art.
Farago, complaining that the Mona Lisa is a gross, commercialized spectacle, proposes turning it into more of a gross, commercialized spectacle by placing it in a building of its own: “Let Samsung or another electronics company install ultra-hi-res cameras around the Gioconda. Let visitors strike a pose on the moving walkways, and then download their cutest selfies with the Leonardo under glass.”
To assume that viewers only want to see the Mona Lisa to check off some vulgar wish list comes off as snobbish, if not classist. Separating the Mona Lisa from the rest of the Louvre in its own Instagramable stop will further brand it as a spectacle, not a piece of art. There, people might be content to snap a photo and move on to the Eiffel Tower.
Instead, while the Mona Lisa rests in the Louvre, visitors must weave their way through the museum, enjoying the opportunity to study countless other paintings along the way.

Presidente ucraniano cedió ante presiones de Trump. Hasta que asomó la sombra del impeachment

Texto completo: En septiembre, el recién llegado presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, se enfrentaba a una difícil decisión: ceder antes las demandas del Presidente Donald Trump y hacer pública una investigación contra sus enemigos políticos o rechazarlas y perder la tan necesaria ayuda militar .
Solo Donald Trump podía desbloquear la ayuda, según le habían dicho dos senadores estadounidenses, y el tiempo se estaba acabando. Si los casi $400 millones de dólares no se desbloqueaban antes del 30 de septiembre, podría perder la cantidad completa, según publicó este jueves The New York Times.
A través de mensajes de WhatsApp y reuniones en Kiev, la capital ucraniana, los altos cargos del gobierno estuvieron varios días tratando de resolver el dilema. La política exterior ucraniana siempre había tratado de no entrar en los debates partidistas estadounidenses pero la ayuda militar del país norteamericano era, según el Times, vital en la guerra contra las fuerzas separatistas prorrusas . Este conflicto armado se ha cargado unas 13,000 vidas desde que comenzó en 2014.
La balanza para Zelensky se estaba inclinando cada vez más para lo que parecía inevitable y su equipo ya se estaba preparando para anunciar públicamente las investigaciones . Una decisión “fatídica”, de acuerdo al diario neoyorquino, ya que el presidente ucraniano había ganado las elecciones con una plataforma anticorrupción que apostaba por el fin de las investigaciones con motivos políticos.
El círculo cercano al presidente Zelensky se comenzaba a “inclinar hacia lo que le habían pedido”, dijo al Post Petro Burkovskiy, un alto cargo de la Fundación de Iniciativas Democráticas. Según él, estaban dispuestos a hacerlo a pesar del riesgo de perder el apoyo bipartidista en Estados Unidos .
El principal convoy de Trump a Ucrania, Gordon Sondland reconoció el martes en su testimonio en el Congreso que la administración Trump había retenido la ayuda militar para presionar a Zelensky a hacer pública dos investigaciones . Una de ellas apuntaría a la familia Biden y a sus hipotéticas presiones para destitutir al fiscal ucraniano que llevaba la investigación sobre la empresa de gas Burisma, en cuya junta directiva estuvo Hunter Biden. La otra iría destinada a acusaciones no probadas de que había sido Ucrania, y no Rusia, la que había intervenido en las elecciones 2016 a favor de Hillary Clinton.
En la llamada telefónica del 25 de julio, que provocó el inicio de la investigación para juicio político, Zelensky garantizó en privado a Trump que su gobierno examinaría dichos asuntos . Sin embargo, lo que Trump en realidad quería era un anuncio público que mermara la popularidad de su principal rival político Joe Biden.
Fue en septiembre cuando Sondland, a quien Trump designó como embajador de la Unión Europea, dijo que no había muchas posibilidades de que la ayuda llegara si no había anuncio público . Lo que Trump quería era que el presidente ucraniano hablara en CNN, según declaró el principal diplomático estadounidense en Ucrania, William B. Taylor Jr.
Después de eso, el gobierno ucraniano acordó que Zelensky hiciera públicas las investigaciones el 13 de septiembre en una entrevista en la mencionada cadena. Pero los eventos en Washington le salvaron de tener que hacerlo. El bloqueo de la ayuda militar se había filtrado y el Congreso estaba alborotado. Así que Trump ordenó enviar la ayuda y Zelensky rápidamente suspendió la entrevista .
Desde entonces, el gobierno de Trump ha tratado de justificar que la ayuda militar no estaba condicionada de ninguna manera alegando que se había enviado sin declaración alguna del gobierno de Ucrania

El volumen agrega que las discusiones sobre la invocación de la Enmienda 25 nunca se formalizaron, pero fue un plan puesto sobre la mesa por el grupo de “resistencia”, que se dio a conocer en una editorial de The New York Times.
El libro se publicará el 19 de noviembre y el Departamento de Justicia ha advertido al autor que puede estar sujeto a acuerdos de confidencialidad como parte de su trabajo como empleado de la Administración Trump.

David Sedaris shares candid stories at Santa Rosa show

Texto completo: Fans of author David Sedaris know that he’s uncommonly candid. He’ll freely admit he’s a night walker, roaming the streets of England late at night and picking up litter.
“I usually go to bed about 2 or 3 in the morning. I’ll walk for a couple hours around the city, and they don’t have street lights in this country,” the humorist said.
Sometimes his travels take him much farther. He recently returned home to the United Kingdom from Norway, and he’ll be in Santa Rosa next week for a speaking engagement at the Luther Burbank Center for the Arts.
“I’m not home a whole lot. I like traveling,” said Sedaris, 62, who lives with his longtime partner, painter and set designer Hugh Hamrick, in Rackham, West Sussex. “When I’m at home, I talk to one person. And when I go out, maybe I’ll talk to a cashier.
“My world is pretty small. When I travel, I’m talking to a hundred people a day. I love picking up information.”
There’s a lot to talk about. Sedaris has sold 12 million books, translated into 27 languages. While he’s justly known for his sardonic wit, his 10th and most recent book — the New York Times bestselling collection of his essays from 2018 titled “Calypso” — also touches on serious issues.
“I didn’t consciously sit down to write a darker book,” he during a recent phone interview. “I write about aging. As you get older, people you know die, and you have cancer scares. Sorrow gives humor weight.”
To illustrate his meaning, Sedaris cites his young sister, actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, and her work with the Chicago improvisational comedy troupe Second City:
“My sister Amy used to be in Second City, and I’d go to her shows and I’d laugh, but afterwards, I wouldn’t remember anything.”
Among the most serious topics mentioned in “Calypso” is the suicide of the author’s youngest sister, Tiffany.
“I wrote a couple of essays about it and the way it affected our family, and I heard from so many people who had a similar experience,” Sedaris said.
It’s common for people to say, “My job is what I do, not who I am,” but no one is likely to hear that from Sedaris. Writing is quite clearly central to his life. He wrote journal entries, essays and stories for 15 years before the publication of his first book, “Barrel Fever,” in 1994.
“I wrote every day,” Sedaris said. “It just seemed normal to me.”
That first published book included perhaps his most famous essay, “Santaland Diaries,” based on the Christmas season temp job he once took as an elf at Macy’s in New York. The piece made him a public figure when it first aired on National Public Radio in 1992.
His radio work had a lot to do with spreading his fame at home and abroad. For example, English folk often find Sedaris — born in New York state and raised in the suburbs of Raleigh, N.C. — a bit peculiar but likable the just the same.
One fellow approached Sedaris near the train station and politely inquired, “Are you the American on the radio who picks up rubbish?”
When Sedaris confirmed it, the stranger went on to add where the author might acquire some choice bits of cast-off stuff.
“It’s a compulsion,” Sedaris admitted, but his litter-collecting has won him some honors. The Queen of England once invited him to Buckingham Palace on that account.
Just as he felt driven to write throughout of his life so far, Sedaris expects to continue his work as long as he lives.
“I’m compelled to write. I can’t imagine quitting,” he said. “People who have jobs, like accountants, do retire I guess. You don’t retire from writing. I would still write every day.”

Texto completo: Oct. 3: Former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker
A career State Department official, Volker worked with President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and White House officials to set up Trump's phone call July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a potential White House visit. Military aid for the country was on pause.
Volker said he never saw anything that made him believe there was a quid pro quo with Ukraine. His testimony made clear the influence Giuliani had on policy, including Giuliani dictating a statement to Volker that he wanted the Ukrainians to issue on corruption.
Oct. 11: Former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch
A career diplomat, Yovanovitch was forced out of her role.
Yovanovitch was confused by her ouster and the comments made by conservatives and Trump, who called her "bad news." She said she raised concerns about the shadow campaign pushed by Giuliani and how it ran counter to U.S. policy.
Oct. 14: Trump's former Russia expert Fiona Hill
Hill worked for years on the National Intelligence Council and as Trump's senior adviser on the Kremlin and Europe. She held a key role in U.S. policy in Ukraine and was part of several meetings where she expressed concerns over the shadow policy led by Giuliani and White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
Hill told lawmakers national security adviser John Bolton likened the policy in Ukraine to a "drug deal" and called Giuliani a "hand grenade" who was going to blow everyone up, according to The New York Times and NBC News.
Oct. 15: State Department Ukraine-Russia expert
George Kent
Kent serves as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department.
Kent told lawmakers he raised red flags about Giuliani's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, more than six months ago.
Oct. 16: Michael McKinley, ex-adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
McKinley boasted a career that spanned decades at the State Department and resigned just before his testimony because of low morale at the department and because he said Pompeo did not stick up for career employees, such as Yovanovitch.
McKinley didn't oversee issues related to Ukraine, so his testimony did not deal with the core allegations against Trump. He outlined his concerns about the ouster of Yovanovitch and said he was troubled that the State Department did not have her back and that she and the department were being politicized.
Oct. 17: U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland
A businessman and major Trump donor, Sondland was in communication with the president and Giuliani and attempted to get Ukrainians to investigate several political matters, according to witnesses.
Sondland told lawmakers he communicated a quid pro quo to a Ukrainian official, linking military aid for Ukraine to a public statement committing to investigations Trump and Giuliani wanted.
Oct. 22: Bill Taylor, top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine
Taylor voiced concerns about conditioning military aid and a White House meeting on investigation of a Trump political rival.
Taylor directly tied Trump and his allies with a quid pro quo. He said Trump made the order to pause military aid for Ukraine, and it was his "clear understanding" that "security assistance money would not come until the (Ukrainian) president committed to pursue the investigation," according to a transcript of his testimony.
Oct. 23: Defense official
Laura Cooper
Cooper serves as the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.
Oct. 26: State Department official Philip Reeker
Reeker serves as the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs.
According to The Wall Street Journal, he discussed with lawmakers failed efforts to help Yovanovitch.
Oct. 29: Ukraine expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman
Vindman is one of several officials who listened to Trump's phone call with Zelensky on July 25. He served as the White House's top Ukraine expert.
Vindman said in prepared remarks he twice reported concerns to superiors that the president and those working for him linked foreign aid to Ukraine with political investigations. He said he worried the efforts undermined U.S. national security.
Oct. 30: State Department official Catherine Croft
Croft worked for Volker at the State Department and has expertise on Ukrainian issues. She focused on arms sales and security assistance for the country as it fended off Russia.
According to a copy of her opening statement, Croft told lawmakers she received calls from a lobbyist trying to oust Yovanovitch. She said she learned that aid was put on hold stemming from an order from the president.
Oct. 30: State Department official Christopher Anderson
Anderson worked for Volker at the State Department and was present for at least one meeting where political investigations were discussed.
In his opening statement, Anderson said Giuliani's efforts were discussed at a Ukraine strategy meeting over the summer. At that meeting, Bolton said Giuliani's efforts "could be an obstacle." Anderson said he believed it was important to not request specific investigations from the Ukrainians.
Oct. 31: NSC official
Timothy Morrison
Morrison is the top Russia and European adviser to Trump's National Security Council and was cited by multiple witnesses in conversations about a quid pro quo. He is a political appointee and not a career official.
Morrison confirmed testimony given by Taylor that outlined a quid pro quo. Morrison testified that he didn't believe Trump's call July 25 was illegal.
Nov. 6: State Department official David Hale
Hale is the third highest-ranking official at the State Department.
Hale told lawmakers about the political considerations in dismissing Yovanovitch and how those decisions affected military aid for Ukraine, according to The Associated Press. AP reported that Hale said Pompeo and other officials believed that backing Yovanovitch could hurt efforts to free the military aid, and some officials worried about the reaction from Giuliani.

Texto completo: Timothée Chalamet and Joel Edgerton star in "The King" on Netflix. And the recent drama "Farming" is available to rent.
What's Streaming
THE KING (2019) Stream on Netflix. Falstaff looks as if he has cut down on the sack and sugar in this loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry plays. Falstaff, the usually rotund companion to Prince Hal (the future King Henry V), is played here by a relatively lean Joel Edgerton, opposite Timothée Chalamet as a stylish Hal-Henry. The film focuses on Hal's evolution from sot to sovereign, ditching Shakespeare's language in favor of a modern English script by Edgerton and David Michôd, who also directs. The story builds up to a climactic Battle of Agincourt, with help from a supporting cast that includes Ben Mendelsohn, who plays an ailing King Henry IV, and Robert Pattinson. "Michôd has a gift for screen violence and is generally good with actors," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, "yet time and again your attention drifts from Hal-Henry to the story's edges, where the supporting actors nibble at their tasty bits."
CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT (1965) Stream on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. A scruffier Falstaff can be found in this variation on Shakespeare from Orson Welles. "Chimes at Midnight" stars Welles as Falstaff in a story cobbled together from several Shakespeare plays. In a 1975 article in The Times, Vincent Canby wrote that this "may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none." Ownership disputes made the movie hard for potential audiences to track down for a long time; only in recent years did it become easily viewable.
THE SQUID AND THE WHALE (2005) Stream on Tubi; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "Marriage Story," a divorce tale with Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson that hit theaters this week, is the latest Brooklyn story from the filmmaker Noah Baumbach. This earlier movie from Baumbach also deals with the breakup of a Brooklyn marriage -- with the parents played by Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels. Jesse Eisenberg plays their 16-year-old son, who witnesses the unraveling of the relationship in mid-1980s Park Slope.
FARMING (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The actor and filmmaker Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje mined his own experiences for this, his feature directorial debut. "Farming" revolves around Enitan, a child of Nigerian immigrant parents who grows up with a British foster family in England (Zephan Amissah plays a young Enitan; Damson Idris takes over after the character reaches adolescence). The plot is mostly concerned with the teenager, who winds up joining a local skinhead gang. "Exactly what enables Enitan to harbor this degree of cognitive dissonance is both the crux of 'Farming' and a point on which this provocative if slightly plodding movie remains elusive," Ben Kenigsberg wrote in his review for The Times.
What's on TV
CONAN 10 p.m. on TBS. The latest in a series of travel specials starring Conan O'Brien brings him to Ghana, where he makes his wisecracks in the West African setting. The actor and comic Sam Richardson ("Veep," Detroiters") goes with him.

John Leguizamo: “Me han dicho que me devuelva a México en mi propio show”

Texto completo: John Leguizamo ha pasado el año haciendo algo que muchos calificarían como un acto desafiante: viajar a lo largo de Estados Unidos con un monólogo que reivindica el papel de los latinos en la historia de EE.UU.
Es de asumir que el público que paga una entrada para ver 95 minutos de su espectáculo admira al actor, pero no siempre ha sido así.
* ¿Hablas español? Sigue toda nuestra cobertura aquí
“Ocasionalmente hay una pareja, que suele ser blanca y un poco mayor en edad, que empieza a molestarse mientras ve el show. Y creen que es su derecho decirme que me devuelva a México o alguna locura así…”, le dijo Leguizamo a BBC Mundo en una conversación reciente en Los Ángeles.
“Por cierto, no soy de México… “, añade con picardía el intérprete de 55 años, que nació en Bogotá y llegó a vivir a la ciudad de Nueva York con apenas 4 años de edad.
Facebook Latin History For MoronsLeguizamo se hace pasar por maestro de escuela en su monólogo “Historia latina para tontos”.
El monólogo, que en 2018 recibió un reconocimiento especial en los Premios Tony de lo mejor del teatro de EE.UU., se titula Latin History for Morons, o “Historia latina para tontos”.
En él, Leguizamo se hace pasar por un maestro de escuela que enseña los episodios de la historia que “no aparecen en los libros escolares”.
La sátira del intérprete aborda, entre otras cosas, la “exterminación” por parte de los colonizadores de los imperios maya y azteca y de los indígenas taínos.
* ¿Cómo sería México si Estados Unidos no se hubiera apropiado de más de la mitad de su territorio en el siglo XIX?
En otro momento, destaca también el papel de latinoamericanos e indígenas en la Guerra de Independencia de EE.UU.
Desde su estreno en Broadway en noviembre de 2017, Leguizamo se ha presentado más de 80 veces y ha recorrido unas 30 ciudades del país.
Con una carrera sólida que ha incluido celebradas interpretaciones en películas y series como Carlito’s Way y When They See Us, Leguizamo no olvida lo difícil que es ser un actor latino en Hollywood.
“Cuando empecé me decía el mánager ‘cámbiate el nombre, actúa como italiano, no te broncees ‘”, describió a una audiencia mayoritariamente latina en el evento Hispanicize, celebrado a mediados de octubre en Los Ángeles.
* De costa a costa, cómo cambia el español que se habla en EE.UU. y qué variedades predominan
Y añadió que cuando presentaba algún proyecto a un grupo de ejecutivos de la industria, recibía comentarios como “ Los latinos no quieren ver historias positivas ” o “los latinos no quieren ver a otros latinos”.
Cada vez que puede, Leguizamo lanza la contundente aseveración de “apartheid cultural” para enmarcar la escasa representación de latinos en ámbitos como el entretenimiento y la política pese a constituir la minoría racial y étnica más numerosa en el país.
Getty ImagesLos actores latinos constituyen el 4,5% de los papeles con diálogos de Hollywood, de acuerdo a un estudio de este año.
“Hollywood está perpetrando imágenes negativas de los latinos como narcos o gánsters que alimentan directamente esa demonización que Trump hace de nosotros “, critica.
Leguizamo se refirió al presidente de EE.UU., Donald Trump, quien busca la reelección en 2020 y desde que inició su mandato en 2016 ha mantenido una retórica negativa contra los inmigrantes indocumentados de Latinoamérica.
Al preguntarle cómo explica ese “apartheid”, arroja estadísticas como dardos: “En Los Ángeles, casi el 50% de la población es latina y constituimos el 4% de caras frente y detrás de cámara. Eso es un apartheid cultural”.
De acuerdo a un estudio de este año de la Universidad del Sur de California, los actores latinos constituyen solo el 4,5% de los roles con diálogos de Hollywood.
* Estos son los artistas latinos más influyentes de Hollywood
* ¿Hablas español? | 7 claves que muestran el poder y la influencia de nuestro idioma en Estados Unidos
Algo similar dice sobre la ciudad de Nueva York, que con un 29% de población latina (los blancos no hispanos constituyen el 32%), “ no hay igualdad en el número de historias que reflejen las realidades de los latinos en diarios como el New York Times“, sentencia.
La opresión de hace siglos de la que habla en su monólogo continúa hoy en día, agrega el actor. Algo con lo que piensa luchar por toda su carrera.
“¿Por qué Hollywood necesita venir a ti? Crea tu propio Hollywood”, dice.

Poll: Trump is trailing top Democrats by double digits

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump loses in a hypothetical matchup with all the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday.
Trump – who has a job approval rating 20 percentage points lower than his disapproval rating of 58% – trails by sizable margins against former Vice President Joe Biden (56%-39%); Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (54%-39%); Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (56%-39%); South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (52%-41%); and Sen. Kamala Harris of California (52%-41%).
Each of those Democratic candidates performed well against Trump in a Post-ABC poll Sept. 5, and all of them expanded those leads in this week's survey.
Experts said a national poll more than a year away from the general election is not necessarily the best predictor of Trump's reelection chances.
Morgan State University journalism professor Jason Johnson said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that the poll was an outlier relative to other surveys that have looked at head-to-head matchups and that "the real numbers that are the best indicators of what will happen in 2020" won't start coming out until after the holiday season.
"The top four or five candidates probably do lead Trump, and they probably do lead the president in a lot of swing states," Johnson said. "But I don't think anyone in our current political environment is going to beat the incumbent president by 10, 12 points."
MSNBC analyst John Heilemann said there "literally is almost nothing more meaningless right now than head-to-head polls that are national more than a year out from the election."
A recent poll from The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading Warren and Sanders among likely voters in most of the tossup states that will be critical to the election outcome. Out of the six states in the poll, Trump led Biden only in North Carolina, but he was within the margin of error in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and Arizona.
According to the Post-ABC poll, most Americans share negative opinions of Trump in several areas. Sixty-three percent say they don't think the president is "honest and trustworthy," 62% say he lacks presidential temperament, 60% say he does not understand their problems, 55% say he is not good at making political deals and 54% say he is not a strong leader.
The poll was conducted Oct. 27-30 using a random sample of 1,003 adults, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.

Texto completo: Headnote A CANNABIS DESTINATION
WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. - The food at West Hollywood's first weed restaurant, Lowell Farms: A Cannabis Cafe, isn't actually infused with weed. But the cuisine could certainly be described as cannabis complementary.
There are vegan nachos and upscale corn dogs, french fries and Angus burgers, and crispy Brussels sprouts as well as baby kale and garden salads for those with more virtuous palates when they're high. (Because, really, what's nicer than sharing a joint over a plate of edamame and shaved asparagus?)
The restaurant, which opened Oct. 1 and has been packed every day since, is part of West Hollywood's effort to make the city a kind of cannabis destination within Los Angeles County. Earlier this year voters approved extra taxation on cannabis businesses. West Hollywood estimates that weed tourism will bring in $5 million to $7 million in tax revenue annually.
"And that's a conservative estimate," said John Leonard, who is unofficially known as West Hollywood's weed czar and whose official job title is community and legislative affairs manager. "We think this will drive more hotel nights in the city, that it will drive more people to come into the city, to go to our restaurants and bars, and patronize our other businesses."
In other words, Lowell Farms is only the city's first cannabis consumption lounge. Others in the works include Aeon Botanika, where one can experience cannabis-enhanced acupuncture and nutrition therapy, and Budberry, which will serve cannabis-infused edibles that customers can enjoy in a garden with a koi pond.
Stoner service
Lush potted plants and slowly rotating fans hang from the ceiling of Lowell Farms, which is split between a cozy dining room and a large shaded patio. A wraparound bar in the center of the space serves coffee. There are juices with ginger and turmeric; no alcohol is allowed.
A hip wait staff takes food orders, while roving "flower hosts" - a sort of weed sommelier - hand out thick tomes with lists of cannabis options. ("How do you want to medicate?" one asked, cheerfully.)
On the weed menu are vape pens with "cold pressed cannabis oil" ($60), loose marijuana ("sold by the eighth ounce"), crystal-clear gravity bongs for rent, and pre-rolled joints including the options Kushberry Cheesecake ($20, "invigorating, active") and Kosher Dog ($27, "soothing, mood booster"), which come rolled up with a tiny spiral noodle as the filter. Heady smoke fills the air in spite of the well-publicized, state-of-the-art ventilation system.
Crucially, the Lowell Farms logo - an outline of a horned goat head - has been installed in neon lighting for optimal Instagramming.
Cannabis-infused money
Cannabis seems to have replaced tequila as the celebrity product of choice. Famous people, including Joe Montana, Jay-Z and - er, checks notes - John Boehner, the former speaker of the House, have invested in cannabis.
Some notable longtime connoisseurs, like Snoop Dogg and Willie Nelson, have had their own brands for years.
Lowell Farms, too, recently announced its own celebrity investors: Chris Rock, Miley Cyrus, Mark Ronson and Sarah Silverman.
It's easy to see why the industry has a particular sheen.
Companies like Med Men, which runs dispensaries, are positing California as a kind of post-prohibition Utopia with a Silicon Valley twist.
"A product that drove people to the black market is now creating a new global market," intones a cinematic Med Men ad released earlier this year, directed by Spike Jonze. "Here's to the new normal."
Last year, according to BDS Analytics, California had $2.51 billion in legal adult-use cannabis sales - by far the most in the nation. That outpaced Colorado, where recreational marijuana has been legal for a little more than five years, by 60%.
Of course, there are complications. As The New York Times has reported, legal weed sellers have struggled to make a dent in the illegal market, which means the promised tax windfall hasn't yet made its way to public coffers.
And because state and local cannabis regulations still don't always exactly mesh, Lowell Farms is, for now, separated into two businesses that operate under one roof: One is a dispensary and one is a restaurant. (Hence, the separate waiters for food and "flower.")
For Lowell Herb Co., the fast-growing marijuana business behind both ventures, it is the ultimate act of branding. "You're going to have this first experience," said David Elias, chief executive of Lowell. "And you're having it at our cafe, with our brand, with our product."
Elias, who is built like a bouncer and who has a background in nightlife promotion, said that in California's nascent legal cannabis sector, investors see a gusher of previously untapped consumer spending.
But there is very little mainstream brand recognition among competing weed companies. He aims to get out in front of that.
Green-rush politics
Industry boosters say that a strong, legal pot market can help correct for decades of disproportionate policing in communities of color, especially by employing people who have been hurt by discriminatory marijuana laws. But experts say it remains to be seen who will actually profit from the green rush.
Ruben Honig, executive director of the United Cannabis Business Association, a California cannabis trade group, said starting a cannabis business is time-consuming and expensive.
"In West Hollywood, these applicants paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to be a part of this," Honig said. "And there are large businesses across the world who would take these licenses for large sums of money."
From the vantage point of some officials, the onerousness keeps out bad actors who may be tempted to cut corners on what is complex and evolving legal terrain. On the other hand, it's a huge barrier for would-be entrepreneurs who may not have access to outside investment or other more traditional funding sources.
"If a year down the line, folks of color, who have been disproportionately affected by our draconian drug policies, are not the beneficiaries of this new market, then we're not being true to what we should be trying to accomplish," said Danielle Jones, a supervising attorney at the Stanford Community Law Clinic who works to help formerly incarcerated people clear their records. "I have more questions about that than I do answers, but as time ticks on, that's going to be our best evidence."
Organic growth
The executive chef of Lowell Farms, Andrea Drummer, got interested in cannabis because she didn't want to use opioids to treat the aches and pains of working in fine dining restaurants.
She was employed at a large hotel that had strict drug testing policies, even in places where medical-use cannabis was legal. After a friend asked her to make pot brownies, she began experimenting with cannabis-infused meals.
Eventually, Drummer helped start Elevation VIP, which hosts private cannabis events. Not long after, cannabis cuisine and cannabis policy advocacy became her full-time job.
She also experienced a period of homelessness.
For about nine months - including during the time when she created a cannabis-infused dinner for Chelsea Handler's Netflix series, "Chelsea Does ..." - Drummer slept in her car. During the day, she would set up at a Starbucks.
Her respite, Drummer said, was visiting the famed farmers market in Santa Monica to talk with vendors and sample their products.
When she developed the (cannabis-free) farm-to-table menu for Lowell Farms, where she is also a partner, she was excited to work with many of those same food purveyors. "Something about coming back in this capacity was just a beautiful thing for me," she said.
Drummer, who is Black, said she tries not to focus on her status as a pioneer in the cannabis industry - not to mention as a woman of color running a notable restaurant kitchen in an industry where that is still uncommon.
"I try to do my part in practice," she said. "And if you come to the cafe and take a peek into the kitchen, you'll see social equity."
Elias said that Lowell Herb Co. has tried to recruit workers who have been convicted of nonviolent marijuana offenses. The company, at one point, took out a billboard near Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles, which he said yielded about 100 resumes.
But the program doesn't extend to those with any other types of offenses. (Criminal justice experts say widespread unwillingness to hire anyone with a conviction is a much broader problem.)
In pursuit of expansion, Elias said the company recently bought a farm near Santa Barbara, which was set to be zoned for 10 acres of pot fields. He envisions the site as a draw to customers, just like the region's vineyards.
"We're working on tastings at the farm," he said. "Which is absolutely breathtaking."

VIP or Nobody? What Your Secret Consumer Score Reveals About You

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.

So, I was watching this documentary about the heyday of Studio 54 in New York City. Back in its glory years, there was a velvet rope at the entrance of the legendary club. Studio 54 VIPs, such as Liza Minnelli and Cher, would get preferential treatment. The “ordinaries” would have to wait outside Studio 54 for their chance to get beyond the velvet rope into the club. VIPs, with higher status, would get preferential treatment.
So, you’re thinking: “Great story, but how does that apply to my everyday life?”
SEE ALSO: Mind-Reading Tech Is Dangerously Close to Becoming a Reality
Well, you might not know this, but some of us are secretly getting preferential treatment from companies we interact with on a daily basis.
Whether you like it or not, we all have a “secret score.” As consumers, this secret score determines if you get the Liza Minnelli treatment while on hold when calling a business or returning items at a store—more generally, it determines what type of service you’ll receive as a consumer.
And do you want to know something crazy? These secret scores are largely invisible to the public.
Ugh. Ready to have your skin crawl?
According to The New York Times , a company called Sift has a file on you.
It amasses your digital footprints, collecting data on you, comprised of such things as food orders and Airbnb messages—and selling the analytics to their clients. (Hope you didn’t already screw up in these areas, because the record is there!) And yes, these secret scores could determine how long you’re on hold when calling a business and generally what type of service you will receive. Again, why can they do this? Because they have our data.
OK, we’re outraged that the U.S. government can access data from our smartphones, via such apps as Facebook, to create a surveillance state in which they can use this information against us. As Edward Snowden stated, there is no good argument for keeping this data as permanently forever—except companies see it as valuable information they can profit from. So, we should be equally outraged that companies, such as Airbnb, Yelp and food delivery apps, also keep our data so that, say Sift and similar companies, can track that information for their proprietary scoring systems. (Though, I’m sure you signed it all away when you agreed to their confusing 600-page Terms of Use that no one has ever had the time to read.)
Sift is just one company that sees the value in our data and profits from it. They do have a file on you, which they will produce upon request. (You can ask for yours by emailing privacy@sift.com.) Do you think this file is simply a one-page memo, like you would get on FreeCreditReport.com?
Hell no!
In fact, the NYT writer requested her file, and (get ready for it) it was a jaw-dropping 400 pages. The file contained every single message she had ever sent to an Airbnb host, Yelp reviews, and a log of every single instance she opened the Coinbase app on her iPhone. Not only that, but going back to Snowden’s warnings on government smartphone surveillance, the report also contained numerous entries that detailed the exact device that was used for interactions—such as the IP address, along with the time and date. Through these compiled interactions, Sift, and other such companies, score consumers.
“We’re not looking at the data. It’s just machines and algorithms doing this work,” Sift’s co-founder and CEO Jason Tan told The New York Times . “But it’s incredible what machines can do when they can look under every stone.”
Sift calls itself “the leader in Digital Trust & Safety, the intersection of positive customer experiences and growth without risk.”
In the company’s own words: “Digital Trust & Safety powers Dynamic Friction, so you can see every step of the user journey and serve up the right experiences at the right time. Connect the dots with Digital Trust & Safety and Dynamic Friction.”
Did you know this was going on? I surely didn’t. Remember how outraged people were when a company once tried launching an app that was going to be the “Yelp of People“—where you could rate other human beings? Well, these ratings are now done behind our backs, without our knowledge, and they affect the way companies deal with us.
In summary, a high “secret score” will determine if some companies give you preferential treatment, while a low rating will make you wait behind the metaphorical velvet rope.

Martin Scorsese is right — comic book movies are not real cinema and they're all terrible

Texto completo: Film director Martin Scorsese apparently felt the need to clarify, in an op-ed for the New York Times no less, what he meant when he said that those godawful comic book movies are “not cinema.”
Anyone with an even mildly critical eye for movies — the script, the actors, the soundtrack and score, the camera work — knows exactly what he meant. He meant that a real movie is a major production where all parts should matter and contribute to a sensational experience.
Comic book movies aren’t real movies. They are, like Scorsese said last month, rides.
That doesn’t mean they’re not fun. Rides can be fun. But a real movie isn’t “fun.” A real movie is emotionally immersive. A real movie creates an entirely new experience for the viewer.
Scorsese explained that in the Times op-ed, writing, “What’s not there [in comic book movies] is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.”
Excluding this year’s Joker (which was more of a drama inspired by a comic character than a standard comic book movie), the last comic book movie I recall seeing in a theater was 2018’s Venom. It was just the same as any other movie in the same genre, which is to say the computer graphics and visuals were kind of thrilling, but everything else was an obvious afterthought: The dialogue was flat, the soundtrack was unmemorable, and the acting was average.
Compare any comic book movie to something like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which brought to life the story of a young boy who develops a direct emotional bond with an alien. (For those of you who like comic book movies, a “story” is otherwise known as a “plot” that has a beginning, middle, and end, with amusing or even stirring ups and downs throughout.)
Everyone who has seen it remembers the scene where Elliot flies with the E.T. on his bike accompanied by the soaring John Williams soundtrack.
I’ve seen the movie dozens of times since it came out in 1982, and the end still sometimes makes me cry.
Who cries during a comic book movie?
Scorsese doesn’t have to explain himself. There’s an obvious difference between comic book movies and real movies that everyone can see and feel themselves.

At least six American children and three adults killed in ambush in Mexico

Texto completo: At least three women and six children, all U.S. citizens, were killed when they were ambushed in Mexico, family members said.
Members of the LeBarón family, who lived in a Mormon community in northern Mexico for decades, were traveling in three vehicles on Monday when gunmen attacked. Family members told the New York Times one child was shot while running away and others were trapped inside a burning vehicle.
Two of the children killed were less than a year old, family members said.

Julian LeBarón, a cousin of the three women who were driving the vehicles, said one of the women, Rhonita, was on her way to Phoenix to pick up her husband, who works in North Dakota and was returning home to celebrate their wedding anniversary when her car broke down. The gunmen “opened fire on Rhonita and torched her car,” he said. The woman, a 9-year-old girl, an 11-year-old boy, and twins less than a year old were killed, he said.
The two other cars, about eight miles ahead, were also ambushed. The two women driving, a 4-year-old boy, and a 6-year-old girl were killed, LeBarón said.
“Six little kids were killed, and seven made it out alive,” LeBarón said, adding that one of the women got out of her car and put her hands up when “they shot her point blank in the chest.”
A video, said to be taken after the massacre, shows a charred vehicle with dozens of bullet holes. Facebook LeBarón said it’s unclear what the motives of the gunmen are, and the family had not received any threats besides general warnings not to travel to Chihuahua, where the family bought groceries and gas.
The gunmen are believed to be members of organized crime, and the surviving children were taken to a nearby hospital.
The LeBarón family settled in Mexico in the 1940s, though Kenny LeBarón, another cousin of the women, said much of his family lives in North Dakota, but they regularly travel to Mexico for holidays and vacations.
A decade ago, two other members of the family were kidnapped and murdered when they confronted drug gangs who have claimed control of the borderlands south of Arizona.

Texto completo: Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher’s lawyer on Sunday accused Navy leaders of plotting to strip away his client's Trident insignia.
In a letter to SEAL Rear Adm. Collin Green, lawyer Tim Parlatore accused Navy Special Warfare Command of attempting to get a “pound of flesh” from Gallagher, despite his being found not guilty of several war crimes in July. Gallagher was found guilty of taking a picture with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter he was accused of murdering.
“The sole offense of conviction, posing in a photo, involved many members of his platoon, yet we have been told that you and others are conspiring to take the Trident of only one participant in that photo — the only one who has already been punished for this offense,” Parlatore wrote in the letter, which was obtained by the Washington Examiner.
Gallagher, 40, was accused of stabbing the injured teenage fighter to death and shooting indiscriminately at civilians while on deployment in Iraq in 2017. The lawyer's accusation is the latest in a saga that has included claims of prosecutorial misconduct, a shocking trial admission, and the involvement of President Trump.
Parlatore told the Washington Examiner his client is being targeted because he challenged the Navy’s command.
“That’s just pure retaliation,” Parlatore said. “There’s no reason to take his Trident other than to embarrass him.”
Navy Special Warfare Command did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment by press time.
The Navy SEAL Trident, also known as the Special Warfare Insignia, is worn only by those who complete Basic Underwater Demolitions and SEAL Qualification Training. Established in 1978, the gold badge features an eagle clutching a trident, anchor, and flintlock pistol. It is considered a sacred badge of honor inside the SEAL community.
A SEAL losing his Trident is a soul-crushing experience, said former SEAL Brad Bailey, who saw some of his former teammates lose their insignias.
“It’s devastating,” Bailey told the Washington Examiner. “You’re losing your whole identity.”
Because of their significance, SEALs are stripped of their Tridents in only the most severe circumstances, though leaders have threatened to pull them for other reasons in recent months. The SEALs who accused Gallagher of war crimes were warned that their Tridents could be revoked if they reported him, according to the New York Times. A complaint filed by two former SEAL Team 7 leaders in September accused Master Chief Petty Officer William King, Green’s top enlisted adviser, of threatening to pull the Tridents of any SEALs who “played lawyer games.”
Green and King have worked to clean up the SEAL community’s image in the wake of the so-called Gallagher effect and several other scandals that have rocked the community in recent years.
Bailey, who sits on the board of the Navy SEALs Fund, a nonprofit organization that aided Gallagher’s defense, said targeting Gallagher’s Trident would be “punitive at this point” and will only rally others to Gallagher’s defense.
“I think the community will probably gather around him,” Bailey said.
Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday recently upheld a ruling to demote Gallagher, though Parlatore said he expects Trump will restore him to the rank of chief petty officer.

Texto completo: Mr. Parnas could offer Congress a vein of information about a political pressure campaign in Ukraine.
An associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani who was involved in a campaign to pressure Ukraine into aiding President Trump's political prospects has broken ranks, opening a dialogue with congressional impeachment investigators and accusing the president of falsely denying their relationship.
The associate, Lev Parnas, had previously resisted speaking with investigators for the Democrat-led impeachment proceedings, which are examining the president's pressure attempts in Ukraine. A former lawyer for Mr. Trump was then representing Mr. Parnas.
But since then, Mr. Parnas has hired new lawyers who contacted the congressional investigators last week to notify them to "direct any future correspondence or communication to us," according to a copy of the letter.
The lawyers also signaled on Monday that Mr. Parnas, who was arrested last month on campaign finance charges, is prepared to comply with a congressional subpoena for his documents and testimony.
Mr. Parnas, a Ukrainian-born American citizen who was central to Mr. Giuliani's efforts to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump's rivals, could offer Congress a vein of information about the efforts in Ukraine.
"We are willing to comply with the subpoena to the extent that it does not violate any appropriate privilege that Mr. Parnas may properly invoke," said Joseph A. Bondy, who along with Edward B. MacMahon, Jr. now represents Mr. Parnas.
Mr. Bondy said that given the federal criminal charges, his client may invoke his right under the Fifth Amendment not to incriminate himself.
The turnabout occurred after Mr. Trump denied knowing Mr. Parnas when he was arrested.
"Mr. Parnas was very upset by President Trump's plainly false statement that he did not know him," said Mr. Bondy, whose client has maintained that he has had extensive dealings with the president.
After federal prosecutors in Manhattan announced charges against Mr. Parnas and three other men, Mr. Trump told reporters that he did not know Mr. Parnas or Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate who also worked to help Mr. Trump in Ukraine and was among those charged with campaign finance violations. The two men had contributed extensively to political committees supporting Mr. Trump and appeared with the president in pictures posted on social media.
"I don't know them. I don't know about them. I don't know what they do ... Maybe they were clients of Rudy. You'd have to ask Rudy," the president said. Of the numerous photographs of them together, Mr. Trump said, "I have a picture with everybody."
Mr. Parnas initially remained in Mr. Trump's camp after House Democrats on Sept. 30 requested documents and testimony from him and Mr. Fruman. The men hired John Dowd, a lawyer who had earlier represented the president at one stage of the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Mr. Trump signed off on the hiring of Mr. Dowd, according to an Oct. 2 email reviewed by The New York Times.
"I have discussed the issue of representation with the president. The president consents to allowing your representation of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Furman," Jay Sekulow, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, wrote to Mr. Dowd, misspelling Mr. Fruman's surname.
Mr. Dowd said in an interview that Mr. Trump's approval was sought "simply as a courtesy to the president," because of the lawyer's previous work for him. Mr. Dowd said he still represents Mr. Fruman.
A person close to Mr. Trump said that the email did not demonstrate that the president knew Mr. Parnas or Mr. Fruman personally but rather knew of them from media reports.
On Oct. 3, when he still represented both men, Mr. Dowd wrote a letter to the House Intelligence Committee that implied that some of the materials the Democrats had asked the men to produce would be protected by attorney-client or executive privilege.
Mr. Dowd told the Democrats that he could not determine how long it would take him to review documents for privilege and accused them of trying to "harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients."
A spokesman for Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, declined to comment on talks with Mr. Parnas.
Not long afterward, in an indictment unsealed on Oct. 10, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman of illegally routing a $ 325,000 contribution to a political action committee supporting Mr. Trump through a shell company and funneling campaign contributions from a Russian businessman to other United States politicians to influence them in support of a marijuana venture. They have both pleaded not guilty.
House Democrats also sent Mr. Dowd subpoenas for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on the same day the charges against them were unsealed.
Mr. Parnas hired Mr. Giuliani in 2018 to help with a venture called Fraud Guarantee. But as of early this year, their relationship had shifted: Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman began assisting Mr. Giuliani in efforts to unearth negative information in Ukraine about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, and his son Hunter.
That work lies close to the center of the investigation by House Democrats into whether Mr. Trump oversaw a shadow diplomatic campaign intended to smear a political opponent.
While it is not clear what documents or testimony Mr. Parnas might provide, he was intimately involved with Mr. Giuliani's efforts. Along with Mr. Fruman, he traveled repeatedly to Ukraine in search of information about corruption involving the Bidens and pushed for the ouster of the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani saw as hostile to the president.

Texto completo: A widow says starting a food group with friends helped her through the hardest times.
To the Editor:
Re "Mourning With Every Meal" (Food section, Oct. 30):
I read Amelia Nierenberg's article about the difficulty cooking and eating with bittersweet emotions. When my husband of 34 years died, and when I was on the floor with grief, I realized that the only thing that made me feel better was cooking and eating with friends.
I put together a list of good friends and friends I wanted to get to know better, and formed a food group. Each month we got together and cooked and ate a different cuisine. The food group lasted two and a half years and got me through the worst of the grieving. I made a lot of wonderful new friends as well, many of whom I still see after 16 years.

Texto completo: LONDON - Labour Party lawmaker Lindsay Hoyle was elected speaker of Britain's House of Commons on Monday, taking up the job with a clear message: I'm not John Bercow.
Hoyle was chosen by lawmakers from among seven candidates to replace the influential but contentious Bercow. Bercow retired last week after a decade as speaker that saw him become a central player in Britain's Brexit drama.
Hoyle took 325 of the 540 votes in a runoff with Labour colleague Chris Bryant after the seven-member field was winnowed down in three previous voting rounds.
Hoyle, 62, was elected to Parliament in 1997, has served as one of the three deputy speakers since 2010 and is popular. Like Bercow, he will run the daily business of the Commons.
The speaker is supposed to be an impartial arbiter of Parliament's rules, but critics accused Bercow of favoring anti-Brexit politicians at the expense of those supporting Britain's departure from the European Union.
Bercow denied Brexit bias, but clashed with the government and strongly opposed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's attempt to suspend Parliament for five weeks as an Oct. 31 Brexit deadline approached. The U.K. Supreme Court overturned Johnson's shutdown.
Bercow also interpreted Parliament's rules in ways that let lawmakers direct the government's hand at key moments. One such move forced Johnson to ask the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31, the current deadline. Hoyle is set to oversee months more of high-stakes debate and votes over Brexit.
Border Patrol agent shoots, kills gunman who opened fire
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. - A U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and killed a gunman who opened fire about a mile from the border with Mexico, immigration officials said.
The agent approached a group of four people early Monday, and one of them pulled out a gun and started shooting, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The agent fired back, hitting the man, who died at a hospital. No agents were hurt during the shooting in Sunland Park, a suburb of El Paso, Texas.
No additional information was released, including the names of the agent and gunman. The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating the shooting.
New Mexico State police and FBI also are investigating, Albuquerque FBI spokesman Frank Fisher said.
DOJ sends letter to publisher of book by anonymous writer
NEW YORK - The Justice Department has sent a letter to the publisher and literary agency of the anonymous government official whose book is scheduled to come out Nov. 19. The letter raises questions over whether any confidentiality agreement has been violated and asked for information that could help reveal the author's identity.
The publisher, Hachette Book Group, responded by saying it would provide no additional information beyond calling the author a "current or former senior official."
The book, "A Warning," is by the official who wrote an essay published last year in The New York Times, alleging that numerous people in the government were resisting the "misguided impulses" of President Donald Trump.
Advice columnist sues Trump
for calling sex assault claim a lie
NEW YORK - An advice columnist for Elle magazine who has accused President Donald Trump of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s sued him Monday, saying he defamed her by calling her a liar whom he had never even met.
E. Jean Carroll's lawsuit, filed Monday in New York, says Trump "smeared her integrity, honesty and dignity - all in the national press" when he responded to her allegations, first broached in a New York magazine article this past June.
A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented Trump in other cases.
Carroll is among over a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct or sexual assault, or both, predating his presidency.
Texan in school shooting said to be unfit for trial
HOUSTON - The trial for a teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a Texas high school will be delayed while he receives mental health treatment, his attorney said Monday.
The news comes after three experts - one for the defense, one appointed by the court and one picked by prosecutors - found Dimitrios Pagourtzis incompetent to stand trial, said Nick Poehl, one of Pagourtzis' attorneys.
Kevin Petroff, the first assistant district attorney for Galveston County, said his office was working to meet with all families of the victims before making any statement.
Pagourtzis, 19, is charged with capital murder in the May 18, 2018, attack at Santa Fe High School, which is 50 miles southeast of Houston. His trial was set to start Feb. 18. Because he was 17 at the time of the attack, he is not eligible for the death penalty.
'King Perry' pleads guilty
in $115 million Ponzi scheme
SCRANTON, Pa. - The fraudster called himself "King Perry," and for a while he lived like royalty.
Perry Santillo masterminded an investment scam that collected more than $115 million from 1,000 investors around the country, using some of the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle of cars, casino junkets and houses in multiple states, according to federal securities regulators.
The Ponzi scheme collapsed, and Santillo, of Rochester, New York, is likely to trade his fancy duds for prison attire when he is sentenced on criminal conspiracy and fraud charges.
He appeared Monday in federal court to plead guilty to a federal fraud charge, having already entered a guilty plea last month to similar charges in Rochester. Each charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
In Oklahoma: More than 450 inmates walked out the doors of prisons across Oklahoma on Monday as part of what state officials say is the largest single-day mass commutation in U.S. history.
The release of inmates, all with convictions for low-level drug and property crimes, resulted from a bill signed by new Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. The bill retroactively applied misdemeanor sentences for simple drug possession and low-level property crimes that state voters approved in 2016.
Stitt has made reducing Oklahoma's highest-in-the-nation incarceration rate one of his top priorities. Releasing the inmates will save Oklahoma an estimated $11.9 million, according to the governor's office.
Caption: Thousands of Spaniards protest Monday in Madrid after five men accused of raping an unconscious 14-year-old girl in 2016 were sentenced to 10 to 12 years behind bars last week for sexual abuse instead of assault or rape. Protests were held in over 40 cities.

5 claves sobre las investigaciones para juicio político a Trump

Texto completo: La semana pasada se hizo oficial: las investigaciones para un posible juicio político al presidente Donald Trump fueron formalizadas por los demócratas, liderador por Nancy Pelosi , en la Casa de Representantes. Los republicanos votaron en contra, aunque no tienen una ruta clara de cómo defender al mandatario.
El presidente Trump califica el proceso de una “cacería de brujas”, tal como lo hizo con las investigaciones sobre la intervención de Rusia en las elecciones de 2016 y ha endurecido su postura contra Pelosi, al pedirle que se dedique a atender asuntos relacionados con su Distrito electoral, en San Francisco, California, en lugar de andarlo investigando.
“Creo que Nancy Pelosi se ha vuelto loca y creo, francamente, que debería regresar a su hogar en San Francisco” , expresó el mandatario en conferencia afuera de la Casa Blanca el domingo.
A pesar de sus críticas, el proceso avanza en el Comité de Inteligencia, liderado por Adam Schiff . A continuación el contexto general para entender en qué momento se encuentra esta batalla política y legislativa.
1. La llamada.- El 25 de julio, el presidente Trump tuvo una llamada telefónica con su homólogo de Ucrania, Volodymyr Zelensky , a quien felicitó por su reciente elección, pero hizo una petición, “un favor”: reabrir una supuesta investigación contra Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente Joe Biden , por su relación con una empresa gasera de aquel país, además de determinar si el fiscal encargado de ese caso fue despedido ante la presión del exvicepresidente. La llamada fue escuchada por un selecto grupo del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.
2. Petición y ofrecimiento.- Tras informarse que el presidente Trump pudo haber incurrido en alguna falta al pedir a un gobierno extranjero investigar a un ciudadano estadounidense, especialmente a un rival político camino a las elecciones 2020, el republicano negó haberlo hecho. Para demostrarlo pidió que se diera a conocer la transcripción de aquella conversación. Sin embargo, a pesar de que la reproducción publicada el 25 de septiembre por la Casa Blanca no era fiel , en ella se establece una petición de indagar al exvicepresidente Biden y a su hijo, además de que el presidente Trump ofrece colaboración a través de su abogado personal, Rudy Giuliani , y el fiscal general, William Barr .
3. Un informante.- Esta nueva batalla ante el Congreso comenzó cuando un informante anónimo alertó sobre los dichos del presidente Trump en aquella llamada. La identidad de esa persona sigue protegida y se descarta dar a conocer su nombre, pero The New York Times afirmó que se trata de un agente de la CIA que fue brevemente enviado a la Casa Blanca. El presidente Trump exige que diga de quién se trata. Mark Zaid , uno de los abogados del informante, pidió a los Comités de Inteligencia de la Cámara y del Senado proteger a su cliente .
4. Dos testigos clave.- De los testigos que han rendido testimonio a puerta cerrada ante los investigadores de la Cámara destacan dos: el embajador en funciones de Estados Unidos ante Ucrania, Bill Taylor , quien afirmó haber alertado sobre mensajes, donde en forma explícita se indica que los fondos para Ucrania estaban siendo retenidos por la Administración Trump hasta que el Kiev accediera a abrir una investigación que pudiera perjudicar a Biden y al Partido Demócrata. El otros es el teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , el principal experto en Ucrania del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien dijo ante la Cámara que en la transcripción de la Casa Blanca de la llamada se omitieron palabras o frases cruciales, como el nombre de la compañía de energía que empleó Hunter Biden en su junta directiva, la cual es Burisma Holdings. El presidente Trump amagó dar a conocer información sobre Vindman, luego de ese testimonio.
5. Los siguientes pasos.- La aprobación en la Cámara de las investigaciones ayudaría a la Casa Blanca a colaborar, aunque expertos adelantan que no será fácil. El demócrata Schiff indicó que ahora el procedimiento permitirá audiencia abiertas, un abogado interrogará a los citados hasta por 45 minutos, los miembros del Comité podrán hacer preguntas posteriores y también se harán públicas las transcripciones de las declaraciones. Los primeros cambios se verán esta semana, cuando se den a conocer las transcripciones de las audiencias en privado. La intención de los demócratas es votar por un juicio político a mediados o finales de diciembre.

Warren is put on defense over Medicare for All

Texto completo: DAVENPORT, Iowa — If Senator Elizabeth Warren thought her proposal to pay for Medicare for All would quiet her critics and rivals, that plan didn't work.
As Warren and other Democratic presidential candidates descended on Iowa this past weekend, the attacks came flying at her. Former vice president Joe Biden's campaign suggested she is dishonest. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., questioned her math. And even Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who has long refrained from attacking her, said his own plan to fund Medicare for All is more progressive.
Warren holds a slim lead here in the first caucus state, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. But as the biggest weekend of Iowa's fall campaign season drew to a close, it was clear she will have to fight a two-front battle to hold onto that lead, with Sanders showing a new willingness to knock her from the left and Biden and Buttigieg laying into her from their more moderate positions.
Well aware of those threats, Warren responded more directly to her rivals after weeks of trying to hover above the fray, calling out Biden by name and retooling the end of her stump speech to address lingering questions about her electability.
“There are people who will just as easily give up on a big idea and sound oh so smart and oh so sophisticated," Warren said in a high school gymnasium Sunday, offering a sharpened defense of a candidacy that is betting bold policy ideas will turn out new voters.
But going on the offense may not be enough to lift Warren out of the Medicare for All morass where Biden and others want her mired. As reporters grilled her on her plan on Saturday, Warren made a rare misstep in describing her funding plan, handing her rivals fuel for criticism and dragging her further into the weeds of a health care debate she never seemed eager to have in the first place.
On Saturday night, Warren told a reporter in Dubuque that her plan “doesn't raise taxes on anybody but billionaires," even though it has provisions that would affect the top 1 percent of American families, many of whom are worth much less than that. Warren's communications team said she was talking only about a provision of the plan that raises her proposed wealth tax for billionaires, but the Biden campaign pounced anyway.
“The American people have to be able to trust whoever our party nominates to take on Donald Trump to be straight with them about health care," said Kate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager for Biden, seizing on the gaffe on behalf of a candidate who had mistakenly said he was in Ohio, not Iowa, just hours before.
Biden's statement also singled out Warren's capital gains tax, even though his own health care plan would also increase that tax for wealthy families.
Warren has propelled herself to the top tier of the Democratic presidential field with a soak-the-rich fight against corporate greed and Washington corruption, electrifying progressives with ambitious policy proposals.
But Warren's support for Medicare for All became a major sticking point as candidates including Biden and Buttigieg knocked her vow to deliver an entirely government-funded health care system that did not raise taxes on the middle class without specifying how. Sanders, who wrote the Medicare for All legislation, which does not detail how the program would be funded, never came to her defense. Warren was left to absorb the attacks on her own.
So Warren arrived in Iowa on Friday with a 20-page white paper laying out her $20.5 trillion plan to fund Medicare for All over 10 years without raising taxes on the middle class by “one penny."
It would be paid for, the campaign said, with a 6 percent wealth tax on billionaires — which is higher than the 2 percent tax she already proposed on people with more than $50 million — as well as taxes on financial transactions and capital gains taxes for the top 1 percent.
Employers would have to put about $8.8 trillion into the system, which is similar to their contributions to the current system, and other funding would come from defense cuts and an immigration overhaul.
Biden's campaign immediately ripped into Warren's plan on Friday, which prompted her to suggest he was “running in the wrong presidential primary." Meanwhile, Buttigieg took the stage in front of some 13,500 Iowa voters at the Liberty and Justice dinner in Des Moines Friday night and made comments that seemed to suggest she is too divisive for the general election.
“I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point," Buttigieg said.
When it was her turn to speak, Warren accused her rivals of thinking too small — “Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight," she said — but by Saturday, she was back to defending herself on Medicare for All.
At a town hall-style event in rural Vinton, a voter asked how she planned to transition to Medicare for All, and Warren focused on her funding plan instead of answering the question (her white paper says she will roll out a transition plan in the coming weeks), touting her claims that it would eliminate $11 trillion in Americans' out-of-pocket medical expenses over the next decade.
Warren's rise has drawn fierce attacks from candidates who want to be seen as a moderate alternative to her, but her health care funding plan has also provided fodder for Sanders to ding her after months of an apparent nonaggression pact between the two liberals.
At his own event in Cedar Rapids Saturday, he seemed to draw a distinction between Warren's promise of free health care without a middle-class tax increase, and his own idea, which he said would levy a 4 percent income tax.
“I'm not going to say it's free," Sanders said. “Nothing is free. Health care's expensive."
He made more pointed comments in an interview with ABC News, saying his approach “will be much more progressive in terms of protecting the financial well-being of middle-income families."
Warren's campaign has pointed out that her plan cuts costs for families at the expense of the wealthiest Americans and corporations. But on Sunday, Warren declined to take the bait, saying simply, “Bernie may have a different vision of how to pay for it, but let's be really clear, Bernie and I are headed in exactly the same direction."
But the issue has put her on the defensive and could distract from her core message at a time when Buttigieg and Sanders are gaining support in Iowa polls. Several voters interviewed at Warren's campaign events said they were trying to decide between her and either — or both — of them.
“I feel safer with him sometimes," said Elise Crow, a lawyer from Cedar Rapids, of Buttigieg, but she said Warren was persuasive too. “You need the numbers and you need the excitement, so I'm more open to it."

For This Crime Show, the N.Y.P.D. Holds the Camera

Texto completo: The New York Police Department, like other law enforcement agencies, has created a podcast that delves into its most interesting cases.
In Episode 1 of a new podcast, New York City police officers find the body of an unidentified 4-year-old girl in a cooler near the Henry Hudson Parkway in Upper Manhattan. Technically, she is "Homicide No. 79" of 1991, but the detectives, some of whom have children of their own, rename her: Baby Hope.
In Episode 2, two years into the investigation, half the country has heard of Baby Hope, but the detectives are still no closer to discovering her real name.
The mystery that unfolds over the succeeding episodes resembles the sort of true-crime narrative made popular by podcasts like "Serial" and "In the Dark." But this time, the creators are not journalists or sound engineers, but members of the law enforcement agency that pursued the case for more than 20 years and (spoiler alert) finally charged a man with the crime.
After decades of seeing its work depicted by others in ventures like ABC's drama series "N.Y.P.D. Blue," the New York Police Department has begun to mine its own material for a true-crime podcast, "Break in the Case," which debuted last week.
It joins several other law enforcement agencies around the country that have decided that podcasts are an effective way to polish the image of the police, humanize them, explain the intricacies of their work and enlist the public's help in gathering information.
"The way that we've traditionally disseminated information is standing on a soap box and yelling at people about what's happening," said Lt. Saul Jaeger of the Mountain View Police Department, outside San Francisco. "That's not listening, and it doesn't allow the community to be truly engaged."
The Mountain View department developed its podcast, "The Silicon Valley Beat," several years ago and said it had been happy with the results. Early next year it will release a parallel series about its investigation into the murder of a 21-year-old Ethiopian immigrant in 1985.
"One of the best tools that we can use to connect with people is stories," Lieutenant Jaeger said. "At the end of the day, that's what people remember."
The New York project is directed by Jill Bauerle and Edward Conlon, a former detective who became a best-selling author ("Blue Blood" and "The Policewomen's Bureau").
Last year Mr. Conlon, who retired in 2011, returned to become director of executive communications for the police commissioner, James P. O'Neill. He began trying to inject more storytelling into the department's communications strategy, writing and posting long narratives like "Old Hays and His Descendants: The Legacy of the Last High Constable of New York City" and "The War at Home: Remembering Foster and Laurie" on the police website. But he found the results disappointing.
"People weren't going to the website for long-form nonfiction," he said. "They were going for traffic closings and Civil Service test information."
So Mr. Conlon and his departmental collaborators -- Ms. Bauerle, the series's executive producer, and Kenzie Delaine, a producer and writer -- decided to create a podcast that would be very different from one that the department had produced several years ago, which focused on distributing practical information like event announcements and street closings.
"It's such an intimate medium," Ms. Bauerle said. "A lot of what police officers and detectives say is filtered through other sources," she added. "To have them telling their own stories is very powerful."
The first season of "Break in the Case" will cover three investigations. Five episodes written and narrated by Mr. Conlon will trace the "Baby Hope" case, which was revived by an anonymous tip in 2013.
A single episode, scheduled for release in December, will focus on the efforts by detectives to identify a woman whose remains washed up along the Brooklyn waterfront in 2015. It will be titled "Monique" for the tattoo found on the victim's leg. Ms. Bauerle, who wrote the episode, said she hopes it will aid investigators in turning up new leads.
Larry Davis, who wounded six officers in a 1986 shootout with the police, will be the subject of the season's final episodes. New installments are to be published online weekly.
Jane Kirtley, an expert on the media, cautioned that nonfiction podcasts from sources other than news organizations or academic institutions were not necessarily impartial.
"It seems important to recognize this for what it is: a public relations exercise," said Ms. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. "The stories that are being told are being told from the perspective of law enforcement. It's not journalism."
But the podcast's creators said they were committed to reflecting with accuracy the details of the crimes they will discuss.
So, in the case of Baby Hope, the producers interviewed the various people involved in a complicated investigation that stretched over two decades.
Sean Kenny, a former police sergeant who was among the first on the scene when Baby Hope was found, recalled dealing with his supervisor at the time, a crusty lieutenant.
"He said: 'Kenny, this is a big deal. Be careful and take your time. Do it right."'
In 2013, Baby Hope was finally identified as Anjélica Castillo. Later that year, the police charged Conrado Juárez, the brother of a woman who was caring for the child, with the killing.
Mr. Juárez confessed, but later said his admission had been coerced and pleaded not guilty. He spent five years in jail awaiting trial, a delay partly caused by a dispute over whether a New York Times reporter who had interviewed Mr. Juárez in jail could be forced to testify in the case. Mr. Juárez died of complications from cancer last year, still in custody and awaiting trial.
Joseph Reznick, the Police Department's deputy commissioner of internal affairs, who as a commander of detectives led the investigation for many years, recalls on the podcast why detectives pursued the case for so long. After all, the police precinct in that Upper Manhattan neighborhood recorded 121 other homicides that year.
"What made this one different," he says on the podcast, "was the fact that it was a child."

WASHINGTON -- The whistle-blower who touched off an impeachment inquiry with his explosive complaint about President Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals is willing to answer House Republicans' written questions, his legal team said on Sunday.
The offer was intended to deter Republican attacks and show that the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer, is above the political rancor unleashed by House Democrats' inquiry. But it appeared not to satisfy House Republicans, who, led by Mr. Trump, have assailed the whistle-blower as politically motivated and demanded his identity be revealed.
Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, directly challenged those attacks on Sunday. "Being a whistleblower is not a partisan job nor is impeachment an objective," he wrote in a long statement on Twitter. "That is not our role."
He continued, "We stand ready to cooperate and ensure facts -- rather than partisanship -- dictates any process involving the #whistleblower."
Mr. Zaid said his client would provide answers in writing under oath, but would not respond to any "inappropriate" questions, including those seeking identifying information.
Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who as the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee has helped lead the president's defense in Congress, rejected such a format.
"Written answers will not provide a sufficient opportunity to probe all the relevant facts and cross-examine the so-called whistle-blower," he said. "You should not be able to ignite an impeachment effort and never account for your actions and role in orchestrating it. We have serious questions about this individual's political bias and partisan motivations."
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, said earlier Sunday on CBS's "Face the Nation" that he was not aware of the offer, but also reiterated his desire to have the whistle-blower "come forward in an open hearing."
"When you're talking about the removal of the president of the United States, undoing democracy, undoing what the American people had voted for, I think that individual should come before the committee," Mr. McCarthy said. "He can come down to the basement, but he needs to answer the questions."
Republicans argue that Democrats' willingness to forgo testimony should raise red flags about the whistle-blower's role.
Democrats, for their part, have maintained that hearing from the whistle-blower is not necessary, and have stressed the importance of protecting his identity and safety. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has argued that a transcript of Mr. Trump's call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which he asks him for "a favor" is already public and that House investigators have already collected a tranche of damning testimony and evidence, including from sources with more direct information.
The whistle-blower's lawyers have also expressed concerns for his safety, in part citing attacks on him by the president, who targeted him again on Sunday.
"The whistle-blower should be revealed, because the whistle-blower gave false stories," Mr. Trump told reporters. "Some people would call it fraud. I won't go that far, but when I read it closely, I probably would."
The whistle-blower had previously offered to answer questions under oath and in writing if submitted by the Intelligence Committee as a whole, but not specifically by Republicans. His legal team first made the new offer over the weekend to Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, CBS News first reported. A spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment.
The offer comes as Democrats leading the inquiry are preparing this week to wrap up the private fact-finding portion of the inquiry, which has been conducted almost entirely in the closed chambers of the House Intelligence Committee. As soon as next week, Democratic lawmakers and aides say, the Intelligence Committee could begin public hearings featuring prominent administration officials intended to present a case to the public. Those hearings are also likely to give an even greater platform to intense sparring by the two parties.
Before then, though, investigators have scheduled almost a dozen additional private witness depositions, beginning Monday. It is unclear how many of those called to testify will appear, given Trump administration orders not to cooperate. Unlike earlier witnesses, many of whom were nonpartisan career officials, investigators are now trying to secure sessions with senior Trump administration political appointees who may be less likely to buck the White House's wishes, even under subpoena.
Investigators issued subpoenas late Friday for John A. Eisenberg, the top legal adviser to the National Security Council, and Brian McCormack, the former chief of staff to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, to answer questions on Monday. It was unclear whether they would show up. A lawyer for at least one other witness scheduled for a Monday deposition, Robert Blair, indicated over the weekend that his client would not show up. Mr. Blair is the national security adviser to the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.
House Democrats have called Mr. Perry to sit for questioning on Wednesday, and John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser who was said to be alarmed by pressure he saw being put on Ukraine, on Thursday. Their appearances are also in doubt.
Mr. McCarthy on Sunday also brought up another witness he wants to question: Mr. Schiff. He named the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and his aides as "the very first person we should bring."
"He is the only person who knows who this whistle-blower is," Mr. McCarthy said. "How many times did he meet with the whistle-blower? What did he talk to the whistle-blower about?"
The Republican leader was ostensibly referring to an October report by The New York Times that the C.I.A. officer approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with vague concerns about Mr. Trump, after he had a colleague first convey them to the C.I.A.'s top lawyer.
Allies of Mr. Trump on Capitol Hill have floated for weeks the idea of trying to question Mr. Schiff, but even some of the president's staunchest defenders have brushed it off. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters last month that he was resisting pressure from Republicans to call Mr. Schiff to testify and that doing so would "cause a lot of damage to the country."
Republicans have toiled to settle on an effective message with which to defend Mr. Trump since the whistle-blower's complaint was released. On Sunday, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said that if Mr. Trump withheld aid from Ukraine in return for investigations of his political opponents, that would not be an impeachable offense.
But even as Mr. Trump reiterated on Sunday that there was "not at all" a quid pro quo, Ms. Conway was less definitive.
"I don't know whether aid was being held up and for how long," Ms. Conway said on CNN's "State of the Union."
She added that the aid eventually flowed to Ukraine. That happened two days after the inspector general for the intelligence community informed the House Intelligence Committee of the whistle-blower's complaint.

Texto completo: It took me a long time to find a new home for the belongings he left behind.
PHOENIX -- My husband and I shared a narrow, shoebox-shaped closet in our home here, his clothes facing mine from double-hanging wardrobes mounted on the walls. After he died of pancreatic cancer on Nov. 1, 2017, a month after his diagnosis, I'd often wander into the closet to search for his smell on his shirts. My mother caught me one day sniffing his shirts and crying, and said, "You can't keep doing this forever."
"What should I do?" I asked.
"You need to find the right people to give his clothes to," she replied.
I packed his shirts, slacks, shoes, belts and ties into the gunpowder-gray suitcases we'd bought for our trip through western Ireland years earlier. That same day, a Federal District Court judge in San Francisco ordered the Trump administration to keep on renewing the permits that gave young undocumented immigrants permission to temporarily live and work in the United States, as prescribed by the Obama-era program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
I noted the events in my journal in short, unemotional sentences: "Cleaned closet, packed Mike's stuff away;" "Good news of the day: DACA still alive."
I parked the suitcases in a corner of my garage, where they stayed for 16 months, gathering dust as the president made a mess out of the country's already messy immigration system.
In these months, my daughter's nanny, a naturalized citizen, lost her brother in Mexico, where he had been deported last year after living illegally for 26 years in Phoenix. (His wife and three children still live here.) The nanny said that he'd died of a broken heart.
Also in these months, accounts of Central Americans released from immigration detention and dumped at the Greyhound bus station in town began showing up in my news feeds, followed by reports about Central Americans lost in the punishing desert that straddles the Arizona-Mexico border, or about children falling ill and dying in overcrowded Border Patrol stations.
I had written articles of my own about the conditions inside these stations during my stint as Phoenix bureau chief for The Times. I'd also written a report in 2014 from inside a makeshift shelter that the Border Patrol had set up for migrant children in the border city of Nogales, Ariz. Then, as now, despair had led thousands of people to leave their home countries in search of what so many of us in America take for granted: the right to live without fear of being kidnapped, tortured, killed.
What I saw at that shelter stayed with me. The children sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder on the floor, in dirty clothes, under blankets that looked like sheets of aluminum foil. These memories, and the new crop of migrant stories on my news feeds, only added to the grief of losing my husband at the relatively young age of 44 -- and to the anguish of raising our daughter alone and far away from my family, in a country that is legally my own but that has made it tough for me at times to feel that this is the country where I belong.
My husband was a proud American, the son of a nurse and a gas-meter reader born and bred in a blue-collar mill town in Central Massachusetts, where, like him, almost everyone was white. He was curious enough about the world to marry me, an immigrant from Brazil. When our daughter was born, he spoke proudly about the jumble of heritages coursing through her veins -- Scots-Irish and French Canadian from his side, and indigenous, Portuguese and African from mine. I sometimes called her "a mutt." He called her "the perfect American."
He was an optimist and in the days right after Mr. Trump's election, he kept his glass-half-full attitude, telling me that the unorthodox president-elect might be just what was needed to get things going in Washington. But that didn't last long. I remember the glum expression on his face as he checked the new president's Twitter feed while silently sipping his coffee. I urged him to find another morning routine, to check out of social media for a while.
He told me, "I wished Trump knew the immigrants we know, all these good, honest people."
One morning this spring, I logged onto his email for only the second time since his death. I typed my name in the search field, watched the results populate the screen and scrolled through the messages, contemplating the simplicity of our life, the tenderness of his words, the intimacy we shared, all of it contained in subject lines: "cool summer camp ideas," "add to nanny to-do list," "miss you while you're away."
One such line caught my eye -- "The toll it's taken," it read. The message, dated Nov. 16, 2016, was in the drafts folder. I clicked it open.
I haven't been sleeping well since last Tuesday. I'm really upset about the election. Was in denial there for a few days and tried to put a good face on it. But I just need to express how angry, frightened and disgusted I am. You know me -- I don't like to emote -- but I am really crushed by this. So deeply disappointed in my country and in many people that I know.
I'm sorry. I love you.
Just that week, I had received a text message from a friend, asking if I might be willing to volunteer as a Spanish-English interpreter when the next group of Central American migrants seeking asylum arrived at her church. The church is one of dozens to have banded together to offer a safety net of sorts for these migrants, giving them basic health checks, some toiletries and clothes, and making travel arrangements so that they can reunite with relatives already settled in the United States. I was on the fence about it, in part because I was afraid to face the migrants' sadness.
I found the courage I needed in my husband's unsent message to me.
By then, the migrants at the church had come and gone. But I knew that another group would be around soon.
The next day, I got a text from my friend: "It looks like 11 a.m. Please don't tell anyone."
I put the suitcases in my car and waited for instructions.
"When you get here, ask for me directly," she wrote.
I drove south and west from my house. On the way, I listened to Bruce Springsteen's "The River," the album that my husband played for me on our first date. I cried. I talked to him.
I got off in a part of the city full of warehouses and big, empty lots. I walked into the church. Just as my mother suggested, I had found the right people to give his clothes to.

Poll Puts Four in a Tie, With Many Iowa Voters Still Open to Persuasion

Texto completo: What we know: Elizabeth Warren has seized much of Bernie Sanders' youthful following, and her coalition transcends divisions over policy. What we don't know: A lot, still.
Senator Elizabeth Warren is starting to stand out in Iowa, as Friday's New York Times/Siena College poll shows. But she isn't standing alone -- at least not yet.
With the candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. cooling off, the race now looks more interesting than at any point since campaigning in Iowa began intensifying over the summer. Here are a few major takeaways from the poll.
If three's a crowd, what's one more?
The Iowa poll demonstrated that Ms. Warren has strength in Iowa, and room to grow -- but she has not quite broken out of the pack. All four of the top candidates -- Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- are technically locked in a statistical tie, according to the poll's 4.7-point margin of error.
Then there's the fact that 65 percent of Iowa voters who named a first-choice candidate said they could still be persuaded to caucus for someone else. While Ms. Warren is at the top of the crowded bunch with 23 percent of the overall vote, only about a quarter of her supporters are certain they'll caucus for her on Feb. 3.
That said, there is evidence to suggest that her support is solidifying. Ms. Warren is the second-choice pick of 25 percent of voters with a chosen candidate -- that's 10 points higher than Mr. Sanders, the runner-up. And she leads among the two-thirds of voters who say they're paying very close attention to the news; she has 23 percent support from that group, compared to Mr. Sanders' 16 percent. As the caucuses near and attention picks up, she may have a particularly good shot at winning over voters who are just tuning in.
Biden's name recognition goes far
With Mr. Biden's campaign faltering slightly, there are signs hidden within these poll results that he is still relying heavily on name recognition, rather than enthusiasm.
He is buoyed by the sense -- held by four in five Democratic voters -- that he would have a good chance of beating President Trump in the general election. Slim majorities of Democratic voters say they would prefer a moderate candidate and one who promises to find common ground, rather than a trenchant liberal.
But Mr. Buttigieg also polls formidably among these middle-path voters, and he is fast on Mr. Biden's heels. They are roughly tied for the lead among voters looking for a candidate who will seek common ground with political opponents.
Meanwhile, Mr. Biden doesn't command even 10 percent among the liberal Iowa voters that make up the party's core. Only 2 percent of voters underage 45 said they would support him. And he draws a good deal of his backing from those who say they have never attended a caucus before, possibly showing that his numbers are being pumped up by respondents who are less engaged -- and perhaps, less likely to turn out.
Are Bernie's backers backing away?
Mr. Sanders, who nearly won the Iowa caucuses four years ago, stands at 19 percent in the poll, revealing that he has held onto a durable -- but diminished -- following.
Ms. Warren has already swept up support among what was once his most solid demographic: young voters. According to the poll, Ms. Warren was the choice of a whopping 38 percent of voters under 30, compared to 29 percent for Mr. Sanders. But neither of them has been able to capture even one out of every five voters age 45 and over.
Ms. Warren seems to have annexed much of Mr. Sanders' support among very liberal caucusgoers; she now has 37 percent of them in her corner, compared to 28 percent for him.
Warren's supporters aren't as progressive as she is
Not all of the Democratic voters who are gravitating toward Ms. Warren express passion for each element of her progressive agenda.
Two-thirds strongly back the idea of a public health care option, and a majority -- 57 percent -- also strongly support increasing Social Security benefits.
But there is less widespread enthusiasm for some of the boldest progressive proposals that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have put forth. Just one-third of Democratic voters expressed strong support for giving free college tuition to all Americans, and only 43 percent strongly believe the big banks and tech companies should be broken up. Mr. Buttigieg's and Mr. Biden's backers tend not to be enthusiastic about those ideas.
Yet Ms. Warren has managed to assemble an ideologically diverse coalition. Though her supporters generally skew liberal, most of them don't feel strongly about eliminating college tuition, and almost half don't express strong support for breaking up banks and tech companies.
Health care has been the most discussed issue of the primary season, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren advocating a "Medicare for all" bill and more moderate candidates calling for a public option. The poll found that most Democratic voters in Iowa are open to a single payer-type plan, but a majority would prefer a candidate who seeks to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and add a public option.
While Mr. Sanders' Iowa supporters are united in their desire for a single-payer health care system, Ms. Warren brings together a broader spectrum: Barely over half of her voters feel strongly about getting rid of private insurance. This suggests that Ms. Warren has room to grow among the substantial share of voters who are less interested in Medicare for all, and who have not yet settled on a final candidate choice.
There's still a lot we don't know
It is impossible to say just how many voters will actually turn out in a primary, or which groups will vote in the greatest numbers. At caucuses, which are more sparsely attended, it's especially hard to know.
So, remember that like all the pre-election surveys that you'll see in the coming months, the results of this one were dictated in part by how our team defined the probable electorate.
Add in the complex set of rules governing the Iowa caucuses -- where backers of less-popular candidates will eventually have to throw their support to someone else on the night of the election -- and it all adds up to a lot of uncertainty. This poll is nothing more than our attempt at a snapshot of where things are at, three months out.
Besides that, Iowa's voters are more than 90 percent white, so the results of this poll carry only the faintest of implications about how the race will play out in the rest of the country. After Iowa's caucuses and the first primary a week later, in heavily white New Hampshire, the importance of the party's nonwhite electorate -- particularly black and Hispanic voters -- will come back into the foreground.
From late February through Super Tuesday on March 3, the focus will be on major contests in Southern and Western states.

Texto completo: Biden holds lead on electability
Loses ground to Warren, Sanders on other virtues The race for the Democratic presidential nomination is both competitive and fluid less than 100 days before the Iowa caucuses, with a stable trio of leading candidates and a fourth - Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. - now rising above a dozen others in the low single-digits, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Democrats see former vice president Joe Biden as the strongest leader among the top candidates and also say he has the best chance of defeating President Trump. But he holds no advantage on five other attributes, including policy issues, bringing needed change and being mentally sharp. He remains atop the field, with Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) trailing, Warren within the margin of error.
Meanwhile, the poll finds significant concerns about Sanders's fitness in the wake of his heart attack last month, with more than 4 in 10 Democrats saying he is not in good enough health to serve as president.
A majority of Democrats say they have not firmly made up their minds on whom to support, with about 1 in 10 having no current preference and about half of Democrats who do support someone saying they would consider supporting another candidate. That has added an air of uncertainty over a race that to this point has been somewhat stable.
Among Democratic-leaning registered voters, 28 percent would support Biden if their state's primary or caucus were held today, while 23 percent support Warren and 17 percent support Sanders. Biden's edge over Warren is smaller than the poll's margin of sampling error. Buttigieg stands at 9 percent and is the only other candidate with greater than 2 percent support.
Warren's support has nearly doubled from 12 percent in July and is up from 18 percent in September. Support for Biden and Sanders has moved less than two points over that period. Buttigieg has gained five points since early September, a signal his national stature may be catching up to his standing in Iowa, where polls have found him rising and with double-digit support.
In Iowa, whose caucuses mark the first contest of 2020, Buttigieg garnered 18 percent in a New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll last week, within range of Warren's 22 percent and on par with Biden and Sanders. In New Hampshire, whose primary comes eight days after Iowa, polls show Warren, Biden and Sanders are competitive with one another, while Buttigieg stands about 10 percentage points behind.
The Post-ABC News poll asked Democrats to choose which of five top-ranking candidates is best across seven personal and policy attributes. Biden continues to lead on the question of electability, with 42 percent saying he has the best chance to defeat Trump, compared with 17 percent who say the same for Warren, 16 percent for Sanders, 3 percent for Buttigieg and 2 percent for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Biden is seen as the strongest leader by 35 percent of Democrats, compared with 20 percent who say this of Sanders and 19 percent for Warren.
But Biden was matched or exceeded by Warren or Sanders on other attributes. Asked which candidate "best understands the problems of people like you," Sanders led with 30 percent, compared with 22 percent for Biden and 20 percent for Warren. The three candidates are about even when it comes to who would do most to bring needed change in Washington, and Biden and Sanders tied at 25 percent on which candidate is closest to them on the issues. On honesty, Biden and Sanders are roughly even at 26 percent and 27 percent, respectively, while 16 percent say Warren is most honest.
On the question of which of five leading Democrats "has the sharpest mental ability," Biden was mentioned by 21 percent, falling narrowly between Warren at 24 percent and Sanders at 17 percent. Buttigieg was named by 15 percent as the most mentally sharp candidate, while 7 percent mentioned Harris.
The poll suggests Sanders's recent heart attack may have raised concerns among Democrats about his ability to serve as president. Democrats were almost evenly split on whether Sanders is healthy enough to serve as president, with 48 percent saying he is in good enough health and 45 percent saying he is not.
The stability in Sanders's overall support, however, suggests these concerns have not taken a toll on his national support for the nomination.
Meanwhile, an 80 percent majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Warren is healthy enough to serve, as do 74 percent who say this of Biden.
Among those who say they will definitely support their current preference if that candidate remains in the race, Biden fares best, with 34 percent support among these voters, compared with 21 percent for Sanders and 19 percent for Warren.
Among those who say they might switch to support a different candidate, 30 percent currently prefer Warren while 26 percent back Biden and 16 percent prefer Sanders. Buttigieg gets 14 percent support among on-the-fence voters.
Democrats' second-choice preferences underscore the fluidity of the race, but also the advantage of the leading three candidates over the rest of the field. About 4 in 10 Democrats say Warren is their first or second choice for the nomination (41 percent), roughly matching Biden at 40 percent and slightly higher than Sanders at 34 percent. Buttigieg stands further back at 16 percent when first and second choices are combined.
Harris's support has continued to fall from a peak of 13 percent in the July poll, which came after a strong performance in the first presidential debate, to 7 percent in September and 2 percent in the latest poll. But the survey suggests Harris has the potential to regain at least some of her earlier supporters in the coming months, with 9 percent of Democratic-leaning voters saying she is their second choice for the nomination.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also fares relatively well on this question, with 4 percent saying she is their second-choice candidate in addition to 2 percent who currently support her.
Age continues to be a principal divider in Democrats' support for the nomination, continuing a cleavage that marked the party's primaries in 2016 and 2008. Biden holds a wide lead among Democratic-leaning voters ages 50 and older, attracting 38 percent support compared with 21 percent for Warren, 10 percent for Buttigieg and 9 percent for Sanders. But Biden receives a much smaller 17 percent among Democrats under age 50, with Sanders and Warren tied at 25 percent.
Democrats also split by their self-ascribed ideology, with Biden leading Warren and Sanders by roughly 20 points among Democrats who are moderate-to-conservative, while Warren has the edge among liberals with 33 percent support to Sanders's 22 percent and Biden's 18 percent.
Race marks a third key fault line. White Democrats are splintered, with 25 percent apiece supporting Biden and Warren, followed by Sanders and Buttigieg at 14 percent each. Among nonwhites, Biden leads with 31 percent support, with Warren and Sanders each receiving 20 percent and Buttigieg falling to 2 percent.
Biden draws roughly similar support among men and women, with 29 percent of men and 27 percent of women citing him as their favored candidate. Warren and Sanders are mirror images of each other. Warren has the support of 26 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning women but a smaller 16 percent among men. Sanders gets 25 percent support among men but 11 percent among women.
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 27-30 among a random national sample of U.S. adults reached on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5.5 percentage points among the sample of 452 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independent adults, and is plus or minus six points among the sample of 402 Democratic-leaning registered voters.

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Presidential mix-up: Biden confuses Andrew Johnson with Andrew Jackson as he slams Trump in Iowa

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa —⁠ Joe Biden confused former Presidents Andrew Johnson and Andrew Jackson during a detour from his stump speech at the Democratic Party's fall fundraiser in Iowa.
"Look what happened in Charlottesville," the former vice president said in Des Moines on Friday, referring to President Trump. "He said there were very fine people on both sides. No president, no president has ever said that, including Andrew Johnson before the Civil War."
Biden, Delaware's senator for 36 years, often cites the fatal riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, as his impetus to run for the White House a third time. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed in 2017 when a white supremacist, who was in town for a Unite the Right rally, drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
Andrew Johnson, however, served as President Abraham Lincoln's vice president for his second term, ascending to power in 1865 after Lincoln's assassination as the Civil War concluded. Johnson was impeached for dismissing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton against the wishes of the Senate and for his reticence to protect former slaves. Nevertheless, it was Andrew Jackson who held the office before the Civil War. Some historians criticize Jackson, who was president from 1829 to 1837, for removing Native Americans from their tribal lands.
Comparing Trump to Andrew Jackson has been one of Biden's recurring tropes. In the wake of the El Paso shootings in August, Biden said, "Look, this is a president who has said things no other president has said since Andrew Jackson. Nobody said anything like the things he’s saying. And the idea that it doesn't contribute to or legitimate or make it more rational for people to think that we, in fact, can now speak out, we can speak out and be more straightforward and we can make this an issue, we’ve been through this before."
Biden addressed the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration as part of a four-day swing through the first-in-the-nation state as he vies for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Polling released this week by New York Times/Siena College showed he was in fourth place in the state behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
On Wednesday in Maquoketa, Iowa, the two-term vice president said he wished one of his three adult children had been Republican because then "they’d make some real money."
Joe Biden and his first wife, the late Neilia Biden, had two sons. Their second son Hunter Biden, 49, earned $50,000 a month on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company at the same time his father played a lead role in the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. The position is a central part of Trump's impeachment inquiry after allegations the president pressured Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Biden family.
Joe Biden's first marriage bore another son, Beau Biden, who was a Delaware state attorney general and Iraq War veteran before he died in 2015 at the age of 46 from an aggressive form of brain cancer. Joe Biden and second wife Jill Biden, 68, also have a daughter. Ashley Biden, 38, a trained social worker, left her job at the Delaware Center for Justice shortly before her father announced his presidential run.

Texto completo: BAGHDAD - Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis took to the streets Friday, continuing anti-government protests that erupted last month and were marred by violence.
Protests have roiled oil-rich Iraq in two waves since early October as demonstrators decried corruption, lack of jobs, and poor access to electricity and clean water. At least 250 people, mostly demonstrators, have been killed in the turmoil.
On Friday, thousands of demonstrators packed Tahrir Square in central Baghdad, a focal point for anti-government rallies. Many of them were waving the Iraqi flag and demanding the government resign, parliament to dissolve and an overhaul of the country's political system that has been in place since the U.S. invasion in 2003.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday the government of Iraq should listen to their "legitimate demands." He also said Iraq's investigation into the violence in early October "lacked sufficient credibility" and the Iraqi people deserve "genuine accountability and justice."
In a statement, Mr. Pompeo added that the U.S. is closely monitoring the situation.
Iraqi President Barham Salih said Thursday he would approve an early parliamentary vote after a draft bill reforming the country's electoral law is adopted.
He also said Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Hadi had expressed readiness to quit, but only after political blocs pick a replacement - a process that can take months due to wrangling among the country's rival political factions.
Mr. Salih's promises have failed to appease protesters.
Despite heavy security deployment across Baghdad on Friday, many people were able to reach Tahrir Square and join other anti-government demonstrators, who have staged a sit-in there.
A protester was killed Friday in the plaza after he was allegedly hit by a sound grenade thrown by security forces in the direction of demonstrators there, witnesses said.
The current protests are the country's largest since Iraq declared that it had liberated all of its territory that was under Islamic State militants' control.

Texto completo: The official whose critical article will now be a book knows how the president "likes to distract attention from a message," says the author's agent.
WASHINGTON -- William B. Taylor, Jr., the top American diplomat in Kiev, had just testified in front of impeachment investigators when a more secretive figure in the Trump universe resurfaced.
On the same day that Mr. Taylor provided the most explicit account to date of Mr. Trump's campaign to pressure Ukraine to publicize an investigation of his political rivals, a publisher announced that the anonymous author of an Op-Ed published last year in The New York Times describing an active resistance to Mr. Trump's agenda inside his own administration had written a tell-all book.
Administration officials like Mr. Taylor were going on the record and risking the wrath of a vengeful president, and running up large legal bills, to issue a warning about the state of the nation. And so some of Mr. Trump's critics questioned why this particular "senior administration official" was only able to share his or her stories under the unsatisfying banner of "anonymous."
"We're way past the point of being coy," said Joe Klein, who himself wrote an anonymous novel, "Primary Colors," inspired by President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. "You have decorated military officers getting death threats."
"We need to stand up and be counted," he said. "This is probably not the time for anonymity."
The White House was quick to use the same rationale to dismiss the writer, whose book, titled "A Warning," is due out Nov. 19. "It takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously," said the press secretary, Stephanie Grisham.
But in interviews this week, the book's editor and agent defended the use of anonymity, arguing it was the best means for the author to achieve his or her ambition: persuading Mr. Trump's supporters to desert him in the 2020 election.
"The author's goal is to try to reach that small but electorally significant percentage of Trump voters who might be persuaded not to support him again," said Matt Latimer of Javelin, the writer's agent. "This author knows the president, and knows how he likes to distract attention from a message by targeting and raising questions and conspiracy theories about the messenger."
Mr. Latimer and his partner, Keith Urbahn, did not know who wrote the Op-Ed describing the "adults in the room" who were "trying to do what's right even when Donald Trump won't." But they contacted everyone they knew in the administration and on Capitol Hill, trying to find the author.
They were not the only ones stalking "Anonymous," whose book will have a first printing of 500,000 copies. Mr. Trump, who accused the writer of committing "treason," began an internal investigation at the White House, and at one point considered having West Wing staff members submit themselves to polygraph tests to find out the author's identity.
This year, Mr. Latimer and Mr. Urbahn were invited to meet with a senior administration official at a private location. They did not know why until they got there.
"I am Anonymous," the person told them.
What ensued was an unusual publishing process involving burner phones, secret meetings in makeshift secure rooms, nondisclosure agreements and an audiobook whose narrator was determined by a coin flip, since no one at the publishing house knew the author's identity. (The book will be read by a man.)
The author wanted to stay anonymous, but was willing to go forward realizing being publicly outed was a risk.
"Our author is mindful that foreign intelligence agencies want to uncover their identity," Mr. Urbahn said. "What better way for a foreign leader to curry favor than to offer up that long-elusive name in an Oval Office visit?"
For secrecy's sake, Mr. Latimer and Mr. Urbahn purchased burner phones to set up a dummy iCloud account where the secret manuscript would live. They decided to approach just one publisher with the project and hope the unique nature of the book -- in addition to the fact that the author would not take an advance, and planned to donate a portion of the royalties to nonprofits supporting government accountability -- would be enough incentive to forge a quick deal.
Sean Desmond, publisher of the imprint Twelve, did not know the identity of the author when he arrived in Washington and Mr. Latimer took him to a conference room in a private building where he was asked to leave his cellphone outside the room. The writer sat inside.
"I'm very comfortable telling you that this person is a serious person and a good example of one of the adults in the room," Mr. Desmond said in an interview. "If Anonymous were to be revealed or come out --- not that there's a plan to do so -- I have no worries whatsoever. I'm very proud to be publishing this person."
Among the publisher and the two agents, the manuscript was referred to as the "December Project," but the publication date was pushed to November after the House moved ahead with an impeachment inquiry. Pretending to be on his annual summer vacation, Mr. Desmond secretly worked on the book from the Javelin offices in Virginia.
"The author is aware that their identity may be revealed as a result of this book," Mr. Latimer said. "Every precaution has been taken to mitigate this possibility, but it's still a real one and we all know that."

Virginia sues Israeli drugmaker in fresh opioid lawsuit

Texto completo: RICHMOND, Va. - Virginia's attorney general filed a new lawsuit Thursday over the opioid crisis, even as the top government lawyers in some states are pushing to settle claims over powerful prescription painkillers.
Mark Herring's suit alleges that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, which is part of an Israel-based company, and Cephalon, a drug company bought by Teva in 2011, misrepresented the benefits and risks of products that include fentanyl.
A Teva spokeswoman did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Some 2,700 lawsuits have been filed nationwide against the drug industry over the toll of opioids, including at least one from nearly every state. Herring's is the first one filed by a state since a group of attorneys general detailed a plan on Oct. 21 to settle suits nationally with five companies, including Teva.
But it's not getting nationwide buy-in so far. Few states apart from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas, whose attorneys general negotiated the $48 billion proposal, have endorsed the structure. The attorney general in Ohio has been critical of it.
The Associated Press has obtained an Oct. 21 letter from West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey to colleagues across the country calling for a more formal process for states to work on a settlement.
Under the proposal, Teva would provide $250 million in cash and a generic version of the addiction treatment drug Suboxone that could be worth $23 billion, according to its valuation.
Herring has not agreed to the deal - and a new suit against Teva suggests he's ramping up the pressure.
"I am going to hold these companies accountable, put an end to their lies and illegal conduct, and make sure they shoulder the financial burden for addressing the crisis they created," he said in a statement.
In the new filing, Herring takes aim at the Actiq and Fentora fentanyl lozenges, saying Teva and its predecessor company promoted them for broader use even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved them only for cancer pain. The complaint also accuses the companies of manipulating research about the drugs, which were bigger sellers than previous formulations of fentanyl but were not dominant drugs among all opioids.
Fentanyl, originally developed as an anesthesia, and other potent synesthetic opioids, are now responsible for more fatal overdoses in the U.S. than other opioids. Much of the supply of the drugs comes from illicit labs in China.
Herring sued OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma in May and added members of the Sackler family who own the company to that claim in September. He is among about half the attorneys general who have rejected a settlement deal with that company.

Islamic State names new leader

Texto completo: Days after the Islamic State group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and his heir apparent were killed in back-to-back attacks by U.S. forces in northern Syria, the group broke its silence Thursday to confirm their deaths, announce a new leader and warn America: "Do not be happy."
In an audio recording uploaded on the Telegram app, the Islamic State mourned the loss of al-Baghdadi, who led the organization for nearly a decade, and its spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, who was killed a day after al-Baghdadi and who had widely been considered a potential successor.
The audio recording was the first word from the Islamic State confirming the death of its leader, which President Donald Trump triumphantly announced Sunday as a huge blow to the world's most fearsome terrorist group.
Trump and Pentagon officials said al-Baghdadi had blown himself up with a suicide vest, also killing two children, after he had been cornered Saturday in a deadend tunnel during a U.S. military raid in a northern Syrian village. Al-Muhajir was killed Sunday in an airstrike elsewhere in northern Syria.
Al-Baghdadi's death came eight months after U.S.-led forces in Syria seized the last remnants of the territory once held by the Islamic State, which at its height spanned an area the size of Britain across parts of Syria and Iraq.
The Islamic State announcement said that al-Baghdadi had been succeeded as leader by Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, whom it identified as the "emir of the believers" and "caliph."
Almost nothing is publicly known about al-Qurayshi, including his real name, and counterterrorism analysts were scrambling Thursday to try to figure out who he is.
"Nobody - and I mean nobody outside a likely very small circle within ISIS - have any idea who their new leader 'Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi' is," Paul Cruickshank, editor of the CTC Sentinel at the Combating Terrorism Center, said in a tweet Thursday. "The group has not yet released any meaningful biographical details which might allow analysts to pinpoint his identity."
Daniele Raineri, a journalist and analyst who has been studying the Islamic State's leadership structure for more than a decade, said that the group's leaders often acquire a new nom de guerre with the appointment to a new position, meaning al-Qurayshi may have had a completely different name last week.
The al-Qurayshi appellation at the end of his name indicates that he is being portrayed as a descendant of the Quraysh tribe of the Prophet Muhammad, a lineage that the Islamic State considers to be a prerequisite for becoming a caliph or ruler of a Muslim theocracy.
Its use indicates that the Islamic State continues to see itself as a caliphate - even if one with practically no territory.
The announcement, in a seven-minute, 37-second recording, was coupled with a warning to the United States not to gloat over killing al-Baghdadi, who oversaw beheadings of American hostages and other atrocities.
"Do not be happy O America, for the death of Sheikh al-Baghdadi, and do not forget the cups of death at his hands, may God accept him," the announcement said.
It boasted of the group's disciples and expansion beyond the Middle East, even as its core territory in Iraq and Syria was reduced to nil: "Don't you see America that the State is now on the threshold of Europe and Central Africa?"
Records of wire transfers and the testimony of captured fighters in the Democratic Republic of Congo indicate that the group has set up a base of operation in the Central African country. - (The New York Times)

Diahann Carroll, pioneering actress, dies of cancer at 84

Texto completo: NEW YORK >> Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as "Julia," has died. She was 84.
Carroll's daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.
During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical "No Strings" and an Academy Award nomination for best actress for "Claudine."
But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on "Julia." Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.
"Diahann Carroll walked this earth for 84 years and broke ground with every footstep. An icon. One of the all-time greats," director Ava DuVernay wrote on Twitter. "She blazed trails through dense forests and elegantly left diamonds along the path for the rest of us to follow. Extraordinary life. Thank you, Ms. Carroll."
Although she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series "Beulah"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.
NBC executives were wary about putting "Julia" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.
It had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll's character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.
"They said it was a fantasy," Carroll recalled in 1998. "All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family."
Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical "No Strings."
Critic Walter Kerr described her as "a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin."
She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: "Same Time, Next Year," "Agnes of God" and "Sunset Boulevard" (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.)
"I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn't my original intention," she said in 2002.
Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in "Carmen Jones" in 1954 and five years later appeared in "Porgy and Bess," although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn't considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included "Goodbye Again," "Hurry Sundown," "Paris Blues," and "The Split."
The 1974 film "Claudine" provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.
In the 1980s, she joined in the long-running prime-time soap opera "Dynasty" as Dominique Deveraux, the glamorous half-sister of Blake Carrington; her physical battles with Alexis Carrington, played by Joan Collins, were among fan highlights. More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington's character, Dr. Preston Burke, on "Grey's Anatomy" and a stretch on the TV show "White Collar" as the widow June.
She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein's at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang "Both Sides Now" with "the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap."
Carol Diann Johnson was born in New York City and attended the High School for the Performing Arts. Her father was a subway conductor and her mother a homemaker.
She began her career as a model, but a prize from "Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts" TV show led to nightclub engagements.
In her 1998 memoir "Diahann," Carroll traced her turbulent romantic life, which included liaisons with Harry Belafonte, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Sidney Poitier and David Frost. She even became engaged to Frost, but the engagement was canceled.
An early marriage to nightclub owner Monte Kay resulted in Carroll's only child, Suzanne, as well as a divorce. She also divorced her second husband, retail executive Freddie Glusman, later marrying magazine editor Robert DeLeon, who died.
Her most celebrated marriage was in 1987, to singer Vic Damone, and the two appeared together in nightclubs. But they separated in 1991 and divorced several years later.
After she was treated for breast cancer in 1998, she spoke out for more money for research and for free screening for women who couldn't afford mammograms.
"We all look forward to the day that mastectomies, chemotherapy and radiation are considered barbaric," Carroll told a gathering in 2000.
Besides her daughter, she is survived by grandchildren August and Sydney.

Texto completo: Lady Gaga is moving from pop star drama in "A Star Is Born" to a murder drama centered around the Gucci family fashion dynasty.
Gaga's first role since her Oscar-nominated performance as Ally in "A Star Is Born" (she won an Oscar for best song) is set around a sensational tale of murder, betrayal, high fashion and money.
The singer/actress, 33, is now set to star as Italian socialite Patrizia Reggiani, the ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the vaunted fashion house's founder, Guccio Gucci. The drama will be directed by Ridley Scott, Scott's publicist Simon Hall confirms. The movie details were first reported by industry website Deadline.
"A Star Is Born" heartbreak: Let's discuss that final act
The wealthy socialite Reggiani was dubbed the "Black Widow" by the Italian media after she was tried and convicted of hiring a hit-man to kill her philandering ex-husband. Gucci was shot from behind on March 27, 1995, walking up the steps to his Milan office by a gunman who sped away in a green Renault Clio car.
As the New York Times noted during Reggiani's trial, "the sordid tale of the Gucci family combines all the elements guaranteed to perk up a jaded public: sex, money, vengeance — and designer shoes. "
Reggiani, who served 18 years in prison for the crime, is famous for her classic line, ''I would rather weep in a Rolls-Royce than be happy on a bicycle. ''
Scott has worked in this genre before, directing "All The Money In The World" about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, which earned an Oscar nomination for Christopher Plummer as family patriarch J. Paul Getty.

Texto completo: Great musical theater talents often come in pairs: Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, George and Ira Gershwin, John Kander and Fred Ebb . . . the list goes on. In the running to join this esteemed lineup of prodigious pairs are Tobly McSmith and Bob McSmith, co-creators, writers, and producers of a slew of musical spoofs, including “The Office! A Musical Parody," coming to the Calderwood Pavilion, Boston Center for the Arts, for a four-week run beginning Tuesday.
The two McSmiths (they are not related) wrote their first musical parody, “Bayside! The Saved by the Bell Musical," 15 years ago. They had met as strangers — Tobly was from Austin, Texas, and Bob from Greene, Maine — when they rented an apartment together in New York City.
“Our first iteration of 'Saved by the Bell' was at a nightclub called the Apocalypse Lounge that seated about 40 people. We charged nothing, we paid the actors nothing, and we were the band," recalls Tobly, laughing. “We then took it to [another venue], and three years later I put all my savings into a fall run at Theater 80 in the East Village and it was a New York Times theater critic pick. We kind of took off from there."
The pair, whose hit shows have also included “Friends! The Musical Parody" and “Kardashians! The Musical," are busy putting the finishing touches on their newest creation, “Love Actually? The Unauthorized Musical Parody," opening in New York City this month.
We caught up with the McSmiths, both 39, in a recent phone call from the East Village.
Q. Why parodies?
TM. We loved “Saved by the Bell" and watched it growing up. We weren't the cool kids in high school. We weren't Mario Lopez or Zack. We were Screech, so I think there was some commentary we wanted to look at with these series that really were formative for us, and look at them through our own lens and find out what was so funny and wrong and different and really grow those moments.
BM. I think we both grew up obsessed with comedy as well. We both lost our fathers at a very formative age [Bob was 13 and Tobly was 11] and we just kind of turned to comedy — like Comedy Central — and obsessed over it.
TM. Comedy was a coping mechanism for us for sure — and a way for us to express ourselves later.
Q. What is your process for writing songs?
BM. Basically, we just sit in a room and we try and make each other laugh. That's pretty much the gist of our writing. And I stomp around and throw things a lot.
TM. We both have different senses of humor and different things make us laugh. But if it makes us both laugh, we know that it's gotta be good, and that's been working for us.
Q. What brought you both to New York?
BM. I came here to go to NYU. There was a sketch group called The State in the '90s that I was obsessed with, and they all went to NYU, so I was like yup, that's the one for me.
TM. I just always wanted to move to New York. I loved “Saturday Night Live," but I also think there was a lot going on with needing to find a place where I could be safe enough to figure out that I needed to transition — especially after going to college in Lubbock, Texas [at Texas Tech University]. The word “transgender" wasn't spoken in 2001/2002, and I felt like New York was where I needed to be — plus it had such a great comedy scene and that was really, really appealing to me.
Q. What is it about “The Office" that resonates with you?
BM. One of the great things about the show is the writing of it. But it's also the characters. It's all about very human stories at the end of the day — stories about love, about friendship, about family.
TM. “The Office" was comfort food for us. When we were writing our seven other musicals, we would always watch “The Office" to just kind of decompress. We both worked in offices, so the characters in the show are just so relatable and the comedy is just so funny.
Q. How does “The Office" lend itself to musical parody?
TM. There are things that you can bring to life and kind of poke fun at. Look at Michael Scott's character — especially now after everything that's changed in society. His jokes can be a little more offensive now, so it's interesting that we have a woman playing that role and making kind of inappropriate jokes to Pam.
BM. It's set in a dark, gray office, so it's kind of the opposite of what you think a musical will be, but there's something about the format of musicals that really does lend itself to when a character's suddenly in a confessional. That's a lot like what a musical is: Suddenly a character is singing and talking right to the camera about their inner thoughts. So it's really fun to juxtapose these two ideas that shouldn't work but really do work well together.
Q. What can fans expect when they come to see this show?
BM. We take all nine seasons of “The Office" and we cram it into two hours. It all takes place over one single day, so it's a rapid-fire, loving homage. We cover basically anything you'd want to see in an “Office" parody — from Pam and Jim's love story to obscure characters that you had kind of forgotten about until they come onstage.
Q. Do you have to be familiar with “The Office" to get the show?
BM. It helps to get those deep references, but we've had people come who've never seen the show and they all get it because we've all worked in an office. These are human stories at the end of the day.
TM. Comedy was an escape for us, and it made us feel better when times were bad. And right now, times aren't that great, so it's wonderful to have this two-hour escape where we're not talking about politics. It's reminiscent, it's funny, and it takes you back to a world that feels safe. And that, I feel, is what we're all looking for right now.

John Yoo: No, I didn't call Alexander Vindman a spy. But Ukraine did engage in espionage.

Texto completo: I really stepped in it this week.
In the course of a Fox News interview, host Laura Ingraham began with a breaking news account about Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert and director of European Affairs on the National Security Council (NSC). Vindman testified Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees about the fateful July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.
According to The New York Times, Ukrainian officials had contacted Vindman to learn about the activities of Rudy Giuliani, who apparently was seeking to pressure Ukraine to investigate whether past officials had corruptly placed former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a cushy post on the board of a natural gas company there. I blurted out that some might call that contact with Vindman “espionage. ”
I then moved on to the focus of my remarks. The important question now is whether Trump’s request for a Ukrainian investigation amounts to “high crimes and misdemeanors” for which Congress should remove him from office. Vindman’s testimony did not add much to the facts of the story.
Foreign policy involves espionage
The White House’s transcript of the call and testimony from high ranking officials show that Trump, Giuliani and allegedly Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, at various times advanced the policy that the United States would not release about $400 million in foreign aid and grant a White House visit unless Ukraine launched an investigation into the Bidens.
The final immolation of Republicans: The House voted for an impeachment inquiry, and Republicans failed a test of character
Critics descended upon me with accusations that I had claimed Vindman to be a double agent or had committed espionage. This could be as far as possible from the truth. I have tremendous respect for a decorated officer of the U. S. Army and a veteran of the Iraq War. I have no reason to question Vindman’s patriotism or loyalty to the United States.
I thought the Ukrainian contacts sounded like an espionage operation by the Ukrainians. They did not just call the U. S. ambassador, State Department officials or their allies in Capitol Hill. They called a top official on the National Security Council, which is responsible not for the day-to-day conduct of diplomacy but the development of strategy, the coordination of foreign policy between the State and Defense Departments, and the approval of intelligence and covert action operations.
We are deluding ourselves if we don’t recognize that the Ukrainians are engaging in espionage; both friendly and rival governments conduct it all the time, as do we. In fact, our current troubles come not just from President Trump, but appear to result also from the intelligence operations of Russia, Ukraine and other countries, which frankly have had a field day interfering with our elections and political system.
Impeachment is not a partisan tool
More important, I did not and do not claim that Vindman assisted the Ukrainians in any way. The backgrounds of witnesses is not important and only distracts from the central questions facing our country, especially now that the House has voted to approve and formalize the impeachment investigation.
Stop carping about process, face reality: History shows Democrats are being fair to Republicans on Trump impeachment: Ex-Starr aide
With the facts fairly settled, and the House apparently well on its way to impeach President Trump, should the Senate take the terrible step of removing a sitting president from office? Our framers designed impeachment, in part, to remove a president who abused his foreign affairs powers by elevating his personal or political interests above the national interest. But they also did not want Congress to use impeachment as a partisan tool to control the president, which would destroy the separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches.
They surely would have worried that impeachment under these circumstances would undermine the ability of future presidents to conduct a vigorous foreign policy, which they argued depends on secrecy, speed, unity and dispatch. I believe that the Founders instead would have faith in the ability of the American people to decide for themselves whether to fire President Trump in the November 2020 elections.

Disney could use Shaq's moxie when it comes to the Chinese

Texto completo: When it comes to Orlando, millions of Chinese think of two things - Disney and Shaquille O'Neal. That may change, thanks to one of those things speaking from the heart and not the wallet.
The flashpoint was Hong Kong, of course. When the topic came up last week, O'Neal said Houston general manager Daryl Morey was right when he tweeted "Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong."
When Disney CEO Bob Iger was asked to weigh in, a communist frog apparently jumped down his throat. "We've learned how complicated this is," Iger said. "The biggest thing we've learned is caution is imperative."
That no doubt pleased President Xi Jinping and the ruling party members in Beijing. After Morey's tweet set off an international firestorm last month, they ordered Houston Rockets merchandise removed from stores in China.
Now they could make all visible traces of O'Neal disappear. He doesn't have nearly as much invested in China as Disney, but it's noteworthy to hear a basketball icon risk the wrath of the People's Republic.
Most of them have lost their voices about Hong Kong. Well, LeBron James did reportedly speak up and ask NBA commissioner Adam Silver why Morey wasn't punished for endangering the NBA's multibillion-dollar business in China.
James and the NBA, ever willing to critique America's social failings, were ripped for hypocrisy. Disney has largely managed to fly under that radar, but Iger's "caution is imperative" spiel shows the Mouse can swallow its principles with the worst of them.
Disney has two theme parks in China, the latest being the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort, which opened in 2016. It's partnered with China's Ministry of Culture to develop the country's film industry, knowing there are tons of yuan in a market of 1.4 billion people. That makes it a bit more dicey to fly your social-justice flag in Beijing than in Atlanta.
Iger said Disney might not film movies in Georgia after that state passed a bill prohibiting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Yet Disney's last "Star Wars" installment was filmed in places like Ireland and Bolivia, where abortion is almost completely illegal. It was certainly legal and enforced in China, where 336 million would-be humans were aborted under the country's one-child policy.
That didn't seem to bother Disney as it set up shop in China. Iger's big on gun control, so he's probably on board with China's policy.
Only government security forces can have firearms. That makes it easier to keep a million Muslims in concentration camps, which are not exactly the happiest places on earth.
And unlike in the U.S., you can be sure Disney won't be filing any friend-of-the-court briefs urging the Chinese Supreme Court to rule in favor of marriage equality. China isn't really into LGBT rights, though it's not as bad as Saudi Arabia.
Being gay there is punishable by death, though that hasn't stopped Disney from kicking around the idea of building a theme park in Saudi Arabia.
Multinational corporations deserve some leeway as they navigate these cultural waters. As Iger said, it's complicated.
But some things are simple.
When you're asked about an ongoing human-rights travesty abroad, you don't go silent. Especially when you're a trailblazing humanitarian at home.
What's the right thing to say?
"One of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say, and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes.
"And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with."
That was O'Neal at an NBA opening-night party. Shaq is no Disney, but he is a one-man multinational corporation.
He says he makes more now as an entrepreneur than he did playing basketball. Consumers have related to the 7-foot-1 man-child since he broke into the NBA with the Magic.
An NBA executive was visiting Guilin, China, back then. The New York Times reported the tour guide didn't know who the executive was, but he introduced Guilin as "The sister city of Orlando, Florida. The home of Shaquille O'Neal!"
Shaq was a huge marketing item as the NBA opened business in China. Fans called him "Da-sha-yu," or "Big Shark," and "Ao-pang" - "O'Fatty."
A shoe company erected a 50-foot statue of him in a Beijing park in 2006. If it's still there, Xi's henchmen are probably dismantling it as we speak.
One of O'Neal's jobs is analyzing the NBA for TNT, which is where Hong Kong came up. Interestingly, on-air employees at Disney-owned ESPN were told to avoid the subject.
Equally interesting, TNT initially promoted the Hong Kong discussion on Twitter, then quickly deleted it.
It must have gotten a call from NBA headquarters, which had gotten a call from Beijing's state-controlled media department.
In this cold, calculating business drama, one giant truly stands tall.
"If something comes across my desk, and I don't believe in it, I don't even look at it," O'Neal told The Wall Street Journal. "Whenever I do business, it's not about the money."
That's why Orlando can be a lot prouder these days of the Big Shark than the little Mouse. And if we like him here, they must love him in Hong Kong.

Deutsche Bank Reported Its Own Deal as Suspicious

Texto completo: The troubled German bank alerted federal authorities to a transaction in which it sold a stake in a California office complex to a company linked to the son of a former Kremlin official.
Deutsche Bank was already under federal investigation for helping wealthy Russians launder money when it struck a deal last year to sell a property it co-owned in California.
The $ 72 million sale of an office complex might not have been notable, except for one thing: The purchaser was linked to the son of a former top Kremlin official.
The German bank was facing multiple money laundering investigations as well as political scrutiny over its ties to President Trump. Against that backdrop, bank executives in the United States raised objections about the proposed transaction, warning that while not illegal, it could further damage the bank's reputation. Executives in the bank's Frankfurt headquarters decided to go forward with it anyway.
After the sale went through, Deutsche Bank officials in the United States took the rare step of contacting the federal watchdog that polices financial crimes to report the bank's own transaction as suspicious, according to three people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
So-called suspicious activity reports are common -- banks file thousands of them a year to flag potentially troubling money transfers and other transactions to the government. But they generally involve activities conducted by banks' customers or even their customers' customers, not the banks themselves.
Deutsche Bank recently contacted regulators in the United States and overseas to explain the Menlo Park transaction, the three people said.
An investment fund run by the bank's asset-management division bought a 50 percent stake in the low-slung office complex on Willow Road in Menlo Park in 2016. (The other half was owned by Embarcadero Capital Partners, a real estate firm.) Deutsche Bank at the time heralded the site's proximity to Palo Alto and Stanford University as key selling points.
The Deutsche Bank investment fund agreed to sell the office complex to a limited liability company called Willow Project, the people said. Some bank officials worried about the problematic appearance of doing business with a company they believed was owned by Vitaly Yusufov, the son of the former energy minister under President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
A committee of Deutsche Bank executives in New York tried to block the transaction, citing the potential damage it could inflict on the bank's reputation, according to the people. The decision was appealed to Europe, where another committee gave the green light.
Later, bank officials in the United States filed a suspicious activity report about the transaction to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.
Sebastian Kraemer-Bach, a bank spokesman, said that Deutsche Bank conducted due diligence on the sale and didn't find any evidence that it would violate anti-money-laundering laws or sanctions.
"As a result, the discussion of whether to move forward with the transaction was focused on reputational considerations," Mr. Kraemer-Bach said. "In this case, there was a reputational risk attached to either decision -- whether to halt the sale or to move forward with it." He added that the proceeds of the sale went to investors in the Deutsche Bank fund, not to the bank itself.
Deutsche Bank has faced criticism for years for not doing enough to prevent money laundering. In early 2017, federal regulators punished it for a vast Russian money-laundering scheme meant to convert illicit gains into dollars and other widely used currencies. The bank remains under federal criminal investigation for that matter and others, The New York Times has previously reported.
Deutsche Bank's handling of suspicious activity reports has been a particular source of criticism. In recent years, compliance officers flagged potentially problematic transactions linked to people including Mr. Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Bank officials in some cases rebuffed the compliance officers' recommendations to file such reports, The Times previously reported.
Starting in the late 1990s, Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution consistently willing to lend money to Mr. Trump and his companies. The bank's relationship with Mr. Trump is under investigation by two congressional committees.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump deserves credit for ordering the operation that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It was a high-risk mission that required U.S. forces to fly hundreds of miles into al-Qaida-controlled territory to storm a heavily armed terrorist compound.
If things had gone horribly wrong, Trump would have been blamed and borne the consequences. Just ask Jimmy Carter how the Desert One disaster affected his reelection. Trump knew the political risks but gave the order to go anyway.
Would Joe Biden have done the same? Unlikely.
The former vice president advised Barack Obama not to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. As Mark Bowden, author of “The Finish: The Killing of Osama bin Laden,” explained in 2012, “The only major dissenters were Biden and [then-Defense Secretary Robert] Gates, and before the raid was launched, Gates would change his mind.” During a meeting in the Situation Room, Biden later recalled, Obama turned to him and asked, “Joe, what do you think?” Biden answered, “Mr. President, my suggestion is don’t go.”
Worse, his reason had nothing to do with national security. According to Bowden, Biden told the president that “if the effort failed, Obama could say goodbye to a second term.” At the moment America had the man responsible for the 9/​11 attacks in her sights, Biden was worried about politics, the absolute last thing a commander in chief should be thinking about in such circumstances. In the end, Bowden writes, “every one of the president’s top advisers except Biden was in favor of immediate action.”
Yet, rather than praise Trump for ordering the killing of Baghdadi, Biden blasted the president, declaring the raid succeeded “despite his ineptitude as commander in chief.” The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation? That’s rich. And it was the Obama-Biden administration’s withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.
Obama’s rejection of Biden’s advice not to go after bin Laden does not absolve Obama of criticism for his broader policy in the fight against terrorism. After the bin Laden operation, many pointed out the irony that Obama’s signature national security accomplishment was made possible by information gained from the CIA interrogation program that he had shut down on his third day in office. As former acting CIA director Mike Morrell has explained, the key piece of intelligence that led the CIA to bin Laden — information on bin Laden’s principal courier, including his nickname Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti — came from detainees in CIA custody.
Similarly, Trump’s bold decision to go forward with the Baghdadi operation does not absolve him of criticism for his Syria policy. The fact is, taking out the Islamic State leader would not have been possible without the U.S. boots on the ground that Trump has announced he is withdrawing, or without the help of the Kurdish allies whom Trump is abandoning. It was the Kurds who cultivated the source inside Baghdadi’s inner circle who gave us actionable intelligence about his location. So, the Kurds not only took 11,000 casualties in the fight to drive the Islamic State from its physical caliphate, but they also gave us the critical lead that led us to Baghdadi’s doorstep. It’s fair to ask whether the same operation would have been possible six months from now thanks to Trump’s drawdown and betrayal of the Kurds.
Our Kurdish allies deserve better. And we still need them. According to a Pentagon inspector general’s report, even before Trump’s most recent withdrawal announcement, the Islamic State was “resurging in Syria.” It has between 14,000 and 18,000 members, as well as about 3,000 foreign fighters under arms in Syria and Iraq. The New York Times reports that before Trump’s decision to greenlight Turkey’s invasion, Kurdish forces were conducting as many as a dozen counterterrorism missions a day, but now those have ceased. The Kurds were also guarding about 10,000 captured Islamic State fighters, including about 2,000 foreign fighters. Now, according to the State Department, more than 100 of those detainees have escaped and “we do not know where they are.”
And while the loss of Baghdadi is a major blow, the Islamic State has survived similar blows before. Thanks to Trump, Baghdadi is dead. But the Islamic State is not. We still need to keep a boot on its neck, and that requires boots on the ground — and allies such as the Kurds.

Farhad Manjoo: It’s the end of California as we know it. I don’t feel fine.

Texto completo: I have lived nearly all my life in California, and my love for this place and its people runs deep and true. There have been many times in the past few years when I’ve called myself a California nationalist: Sure, America seemed to be going crazy, but at least I lived in the Golden State, where things were still pretty chill.
But lately my affinity for my home state has soured. Maybe it’s the smoke and the blackouts, but a very un-Californian nihilism has been creeping into my thinking. I’m starting to suspect we’re over. It’s the end of California as we know it. I don’t feel fine.
It isn’t just the fires — although, my God, the fires. Is this what life in America’s most populous, most prosperous state is going to be like from now on? Every year, hundreds of thousands evacuating, millions losing power, hundreds losing property and lives? Last year, the air near where I live in Northern California — within driving distance of some of the largest and most powerful and advanced corporations in the history of the world — was more hazardous than the air in Beijing and New Delhi. There’s a good chance that will happen again this month, and that it will keep happening every year from now on. Is this really the best America can do?
Probably, because it’s only going to get worse. The fires and the blackouts aren’t like the earthquakes, a natural threat we’ve all chosen to ignore. They are more like California’s other problems, like housing affordability and homelessness and traffic — human-made catastrophes we’ve all chosen to ignore, connected to the larger dysfunction at the heart of our state’s rot: a failure to live sustainably.
Now choking under the smoke of a changing climate, California feels stuck. We are BlackBerry after the iPhone, Blockbuster after Netflix: We’ve got the wrong design, we bet on the wrong technologies, we’ve got the wrong incentives, and we’re saddled with the wrong culture. The founding idea of this place is infinitude — mile after endless mile of cute houses connected by freeways and uninsulated power lines stretching out far into the forested hills. Our whole way of life is built on a series of myths — the myth of endless space, endless fuel, endless water, endless optimism, endless outward reach and endless free parking.
One by one, those myths are bursting into flame. We are running out of land, housing, water, road space and now electricity. Fixing all this requires systemic change, but we aren’t up to the task. We are hemmed in by a resentful national government and an uncaring national media, and we have never been able to prize sustainability and equality over quick-fix hacks and outsized prizes to the rich.
All of our instincts seem to make things worse. Our de facto solution to housing affordability has been forcing people to move farther and farther away from cities, so they commute longer, make traffic worse and increase the population of fire-prone areas. We “solved” the problem of poor urban transportation by inviting private companies like Uber and Lyft to take over our roads. To keep the fires at bay, we are now employing the oldest I.T. hack in the book: turning the power off and then turning it back on again. Meanwhile, the rich are getting by: When the fires come, they hire their own firefighters. (Their gardeners and housekeepers still had to go to work, though.)
Does all this sound overdramatic? You might point out that if it seems like dystopian apocalypse in California, it’s because it has always felt like dystopian apocalypse in California. The California of Joan Didion, Charles Manson and Ronald Reagan was no picnic; nor was the California of Pete Wilson, Rodney King or Arnold Schwarzenegger. California has always been a place that seems to be on the edge and running on empty, and maybe the best you can ever say about it is, hey, at least we’re not Florida.
But this time it’s different. The apocalypse now feels more elemental — as if the place is not working in a fundamental way, at the level of geography and climate. And everything we need to do to avoid the end goes against everything we’ve ever done.
The long-term solutions to many of our problems are obvious: To stave off fire and housing costs and so much else, the people of California should live together more densely. We should rely less on cars. And we should be more inclusive in the way we design infrastructure — transportation, the power grid, housing stock — aiming to design for the many rather than for the wealthy few.
If we redesigned our cities for the modern world, they’d be taller and less stretched out into the fire-prone far reaches — what scientists call the wildland-urban interface. Housing would be affordable because there’d be more of it. You’d be able to get around more cheaply because we’d ditch cars and turn to buses and trains and other ways we know how to move around a lot of people at high speeds, for low prices. It wouldn’t be the end of the California dream, but a reconceptualization — not as many endless blocks of backyards and swimming pools, but perhaps a new kind of more livable, more accessible life for all.
But who wants to do all this? Not the people of this state. Sure, we’ll ban plastic bags and try to increase gas-mileage standards (until the federal government tries to stops us, which of course it can, because our 40 million people get the same voting power in the Senate as Wyoming’s 600,000).
But the big things still seem impossible here. In a state where 40 years ago, homeowners passed a constitutional amendment enshrining their demands for low property taxes forever, where every initiative at increasing density still seems to fail, where vital resources like electricity are managed by unscrupulous corporations and where cars are still far and away the most beloved way to get around, it’s hard to imagine systemic change happening anytime soon.
And so we muddle on toward the end. All the leaves are burned and the sky is gray. California, as it’s currently designed, will not survive the coming climate. Either we alter how we live here, or many of us won’t live here anymore.

Texto completo: Following in the footsteps of many New Yorkers who have moved to the Sunshine State in order to take advantage of lower tax bills, President Donald Trump said on Thursday evening that he will now be a resident of Florida, as he blamed high taxes and unfair treatment from officials of the Empire State for his decision.
"Few have been treated worse," the President tweeted, "despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state."
"I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence," the President said, moving to a state with no income tax, and no inheritance tax.
The change was first reported by the New York Times.

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the White House, is the place I have come to love and will stay for, hopefully, another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, but my family and I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence. I cherish New York, and the people of.....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2019
....New York, and always will, but unfortunately, despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse. I hated having to make....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2019
....this decision, but in the end it will be best for all concerned. As President, I will always be there to help New York and the great people of New York. It will always have a special place in my heart!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2019
Mr. Trump is using his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as his official residence.
The news prompted a Twitter rebuke from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.
"Good riddance," the Governor tweeted.

Good riddance.
It’s not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway...
He’s all yours, Florida. https://t.co/9AX0q1aBkQ
— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 1, 2019
Census Bureau figures released earlier this year show that New Yorkers lead the way in terms of people moving to the state of Florida.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump publicó una foto falsa donde se le ve colocando una medalla al can que ayudó a encontrar al líder de ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .
“¡Héroe americano!”, escribió el mandatario en un tuit al compartir la imagen que es evidentemente falsa y cuyo intervención en ‘photoshop’ fue confirmada por un funcionario de la Casa Blanca a The New York Times.
AMERICAN HERO! pic.twitter.com/XCCa2sGfsZ
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019
El presidente ya había publicado la imagen real del perro, del cual se desconoce el nombre, porque es clasificado, pero en el tuit del 28 de octubre, el mandatario dijo que el can entrenado “hizo un gran trabajo” para la captura y muerte del terrorista.
We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019
La imagen origina fue cuando se colocó una medalla al veterano James McCloughan .
So apparently Trump, aka THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, shared a photoshopped picture of him giving a medal to a "hero dog." The original photo was of army vet James McCloughan.
So glad to see our president is spending his time wisely. ???? pic.twitter.com/9xKwkZ17A0

Las críticas al presidente llegaron de varios lados, como del autor Tomi T. Ahonen, quien calificó a Trump como el mandatario “menos valiente”.
Donald Trump: Braveliest President: Afraid of Hero Dog Afraid of bone spurs Afraid of his own school grades Afraid of his own tax returns Afraid of baseball booing Afraid of people coughing Afraid of impeachment Afraid of windmills Afraid of John McCain Afraid of USS John McCain

El influencer Tony Posnanski dijo que estaba de acuerdo en que el perro era un héroe, pero preguntó: “¿Quién es el tonto que está detrás?”.
Agreed but who is the fucking dumbfuck asshole behind the dog?

Ryan Fourner , dirigente de Estudiantes por Trumo, preguntó cuántos verificadores de información habría utilizado CNN para confirmar una fotografía que era evidentemente falsa.
Now the Left is going wild because they just figured out… that this photo… is indeed photoshopped.
I wonder how many CNN “fact checkers” it took to figure this one out ??

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump publicó una foto falsa donde se le ve colocando una medalla al can que ayudó a encontrar al líder de ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .
“¡Héroe americano!”, escribió el mandatario en un tuit al compartir la imagen que es evidentemente falsa y cuyo intervención en ‘photoshop’ fue confirmada por un funcionario de la Casa Blanca a The New York Times.
AMERICAN HERO! pic.twitter.com/XCCa2sGfsZ
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2019
El presidente ya había publicado la imagen real del perro, del cual se desconoce el nombre, porque es clasificado, pero en el tuit del 28 de octubre, el mandatario dijo que el can entrenado “hizo un gran trabajo” para la captura y muerte del terrorista.
We have declassified a picture of the wonderful dog (name not declassified) that did such a GREAT JOB in capturing and killing the Leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi! pic.twitter.com/PDMx9nZWvw
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 28, 2019
La imagen origina fue cuando se colocó una medalla al veterano James McCloughan .
So apparently Trump, aka THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, shared a photoshopped picture of him giving a medal to a "hero dog." The original photo was of army vet James McCloughan.
So glad to see our president is spending his time wisely. ???? pic.twitter.com/9xKwkZ17A0

Las críticas al presidente llegaron de varios lados, como del autor Tomi T. Ahonen, quien calificó a Trump como el mandatario “menos valiente”.
Donald Trump: Braveliest President: Afraid of Hero Dog Afraid of bone spurs Afraid of his own school grades Afraid of his own tax returns Afraid of baseball booing Afraid of people coughing Afraid of impeachment Afraid of windmills Afraid of John McCain Afraid of USS John McCain

El influencer Tony Posnanski dijo que estaba de acuerdo en que el perro era un héroe, pero preguntó: “¿Quién es el tonto que está detrás?”.
Agreed but who is the fucking dumbfuck asshole behind the dog?

Otros simplemente hicieron un montaje distinto.

Incluso hubo quienes consideraron que esto era crueldad animal y debería reportarse a PETA, como dijo la opinóloga Leslie Abravanel .
Quick, someone call @PETA. Subjecting this courageous K9 to the traitorous #TurdReich troll is animal cruelty. #ImpeachandRemoveTrumpNow
— Lesley Abravanel?? (@lesleyabravanel) October 30, 2019
Ryan Fourner , dirigente de Estudiantes por Trumo, preguntó cuántos verificadores de información habría utilizado CNN para confirmar una fotografía que era evidentemente falsa.
Now the Left is going wild because they just figured out… that this photo… is indeed photoshopped.
I wonder how many CNN “fact checkers” it took to figure this one out ??

Texto completo: COUNCIL BLUFFS — Democratic U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris gave a pointed speech about racism in America on Tuesday night, telling a crowd that the killing of black men and women by the police is one of the country's most fundamental problems.
Harris, who is running for president, mentioned the death of Atatiana Jefferson, a 28-year-old black woman shot and killed in her home by a white Fort Worth, Texas, police officer on Oct. 12. The officer shot her through her bedroom window, according to the Dallas Morning News.
"Justice is on the ballot when we have a system of mass incarceration in America and we have people like a young woman by the name of Atatiana who is sitting in her home and is shot and killed because, apparently, probable cause is being black in your own room," said Harris, who built her career as a prosecutor and attorney general in California before she ran for the Senate.
During Harris' town hall at Lincoln's Pub, which had a crowd of about 240 people, a woman asked the candidate how she would heal divisions in the United States. Harris said she will encourage uncomfortable conversations about the country's history.
She accused fellow Democrats of trying to heal the country "based on some inauthentic view of what unity looks like." She said members of her party use the term "identity politics" to discourage conversations with minorities. She called the term "the modern version of the race card."
"It's a term that, I find, is raised whenever we're talking about issues that are essentially civil rights issues," she said. "About race, gender, orientation, religion — things of that nature. And it is raised with the intention of marginalizing the issue. Or shushing or shutting us up. And here's the thing about it: When we talk about where America stands on these issues, that's not about identity politics — someone's identity. It's about America's identity. Where America stands on those issues is about America's identity."
She continued: "Unity for the sake of unity is not unity. Unity — true unity — is not just, 'Hey, everybody come under one roof and let's sing a kumbaya song.' That's not unity. It's not unity to say, 'Hey, you guys, you should be a little bit quieter about your thing.' That's not unity. Unity is when everybody is in the room and there is mutual respect and acknowledgment about issues that each faces — that's my vision of unity. And I know we can get there."
For months, Harris has called her status as a biracial woman in the election "the elephant in the room." She frequently tells crowds that she hears feedback that the country isn't ready to elect a woman of color to its highest office. She generally ends the moment by telling the crowd that she believes they are progressive enough to look beyond the country's history. Sometimes, she also tells a story about campaigning for then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama in Iowa before the 2008 Democratic caucus.
But Tuesday's speech, with criticism of a specific police shooting and an attack toward members of her own political party, was bolder than Harris' past discussions about race. Some members of the crowd said they were impressed.
Alesia Montgomery, who is black and volunteers for Harris, said she fears police officers could shoot her or her family members without justification.
"It's exactly true," she said. "[Harris] can say that because she can cross different lines and she can make it real — that's the prosecutor in her. We need her right now."
Ernest Thompson also said he was pleased with how bluntly Harris discussed racism. He believes Harris' race and gender affect her campaign in subtle ways, he said. During the most recent Democratic debate, he felt the moderates didn't call on her enough and didn't treat her like a serious candidate. (A New York Times analysis of the event estimated she spoke for 12 minutes and 23 seconds, the seventh most out of 12 candidates.)
"There's a disappointment, sometimes, you get," Thompson said. "It seemed like she didn't get too many words in. Everybody else got words in."

Routes to New Insights on Race and Identity

Texto completo: Podcasts featuring inmates. The evolution of social media. The writing of Stephen Hawking. All are routes to thinking about race and identity, says Lauretta Charlton, editor of Race/Related.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Lauretta Charlton, editor of the Race/Related newsletter , discussed the tech she's using.
What are your most important tech tools for work and why?
The newsroom at The Times is a very loud and busy place, which is exciting but not always ideal when you're trying to edit or write a complicated story about race and identity. I do my best work when I'm focused, and for me that requires a certain solitude.
Noise-canceling headphones are crucial. I've had mine since 2015. They are over-the-ear headphones from the German audio company Sennheiser. Putting them on helps me concentrate. As for what I'm listening to, it's usually hard bop or contemporary classical. Recently it's been "Hudson River Wind Meditations," by Lou Reed.
What tech tools have been useful in giving insight into race, identity and culture?
There is a podcast called Ear Hustle that is very good for this reason: The United States has more prisoners than any other country in the world.
I think we spend a lot of time trying to forget that, and frankly, it's made easier to do when most of the people behind bars are black and brown. Ear Hustle is about life inside San Quentin State Prison in California. It's co-hosted by an interesting trio -- a current inmate, a former inmate and a volunteer.
Each host brings a different perspective to the issue of mass incarceration, which has affected the lives of many families across the country, including my own. They interview prisoners, they explain in detail the way prisons work and they're honest about how people end up there. It changed my understanding of the criminal justice system. They are also very funny.
This has been a very charged atmosphere for race. Has social media been helpful or thoughtful in exploring these topics?
It has been helpful, but much has changed.
Ferguson, Mo., is a good example. After Michael Brown was shot and killed there by Darren Wilson, young people of color started sharing images and live video on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, demanding that we pay attention to the death of another unarmed black man and recognize it for what it was -- a national crisis. Social media created a community. It became an outlet for their outrage, and they were targeted for it by police.
But that was five years ago. Today, outrage feels like the only thing on social media. It seems one of the easiest ways to build followers is to be consistently angry about something, whether it's racism, politics or food. And the more extreme the view, the better. In many ways, social media has become a hotbed for radicalization and misinformation and bigotry.
I believe social media helped lift the Black Lives Matter movement and raise our awareness of police brutality, but I also believe it helped the white nationalists who protested in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. In my view, these are manifestations of the same phenomenon.
Technology itself has been famously ham-handed at dealing with race. There are questions about whether algorithms exacerbate bias , about why facial recognition makes more errors when trying to identify dark-skinned people .
Racism in technology is a serious problem, and I know there are many people who are much smarter than I am who are thinking about how to solve it.
In 2014, Stephen Hawking wrote a piece that I will never forget. He warned that artificial intelligence was advancing rapidly and that we needed to be honest with ourselves about whether or not we were prepared for what that meant. We are feeding machines with information everyday, and the information we choose to provide says a lot about who we are -- our racism, our values, our strengths, our weaknesses.
In other words, when facial recognition software makes an error when identifying a person with dark skin, I believe that says more about us than it does about what the algorithm is capable of doing.
I think Mr. Hawking's point was that you don't have to spend all your time reading about neural networks and deep machine learning and A.I. and data streams to be concerned about this. Ultimately I think he was arguing this is a human rights issue. Interestingly, his article was published the same year that Facebook apologized for running psychological experiments on users without their knowledge.
Outside of work, what is your favorite tech gadget or tool and why?
I used to write about music, and lately I've been very into Dust-to-Digital, which is an archival record label based in Atlanta. They've been around for about 20 years and their mission is to make hard-to-find music from all over the world more accessible through research, production and technology. I absolutely love their presence on Twitter, where they often post rare performance footage of black American folk artists. But they share good music from across the globe.
Recently they posted a clip of 19-year-old Indian singer Maithili Thakur playing harmonium and singing with her brothers. I've probably watched it five times. I stopped writing about music years ago, but I'm still a great believer in the power of music to unite us.
You recently got married. Which tech was essential in the planning?
We created so many Google spreadsheets. At one point I considered creating a Google spreadsheet to keep track of all of them. But I wouldn't change a thing. I love married life.

Texto completo: His unwavering belief in the Halloween deity has drawn me to the 1966 "Peanuts" special year after year.
Pop culture can feel like religion when you're a kid, a shared set of heroes and poses, attitudes, moods and jokes. For my father, who was born in 1933, it was a tone set by the two Franks -- Sinatra and Capra. In my formative years, which ran from the mid-1970s to the mid-'80s, my general outlook on life, though fueled by David Letterman and Bruce Springsteen, was anchored by "Peanuts," the world drawn by the cartoonist Charles Schulz.
It was Lucy, Linus and Charlie Brown, a Job who suffered to soothe our suffering. It was a faith related via parable, the classic text being the 1966 TV special "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown."
The imagery and music were what first drew me to the show, which I encountered in rebroadcasts. Here, in the age of "Kojak," was a planet made for kids, a planet without school and without parents, where the leaves of autumn turn into the sort of phantasmagoria experienced when you get too close to the paste.
But it was the story that held me. Next to its predecessor "A Charlie Brown Christmas," which culminates in the transcendent moment when Linus recites the annunciation to the shepherds from the Gospel of Luke, "The Great Pumpkin" might seem less profound -- yet the show is the purest parable of faith I know. You believe not because it makes sense, but because it's ridiculous.
The show's producer, Lee Mendelson, and the director, Bill Melendez, built the special around an oddball of a comic strip Schulz had written years before. In that strip, Linus, an artist and the most sensitive of the "Peanuts" gang (and who carries a security blanket as a preacher carries a Bible), writes a letter asking for succor from the Great Pumpkin as another might ask for succor from Santa or Jesus.
Linus seems to be the only one in his group of friends who is a believer and seeks to achieve a state of perfect "sincerity." Variations of this word are used several times; Linus seeks the most "sincere" pumpkin patch to serve as his version of Gethsemane, the garden outside Jerusalem where Jesus prayed on the night of his arrest. Linus believes his faith will be rewarded, in the hours before dawn, by a visit from the Great Pumpkin. The figure will hover over the patch as God hovered over the waters. ("Each year the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch he thinks is the most sincere," Linus explains.)
It's his faith that makes Linus a laughingstock, a figure of pity and contempt. If you believe deeply in anything, you become vulnerable and look foolish. And that, to me, is what "The Great Pumpkin" is about: the passion of Linus van Pelt, degradation and humiliation, refusal to submit.
The story opens with death and resurrection. Linus carries home a pumpkin, which his sister, Lucy, cuts and guts, causing him to scream, "I didn't know you were going to kill it!" A festival meant to end with the ascent of a Great Pumpkin has begun with the execution of a regular pumpkin.
Linus is mocked as he writes to the Great Pumpkin: "Everyone tells me you're a fake, but I believe in you. P.S. If you really are a fake, don't tell me. I don't want to know." When his Lucy and the others go off to trick-or-treat, Linus enters the wilderness of the pumpkin patch, where he will spend the night in a kind of prayer, seeking to achieve the kind of honest belief that will summon the spirit.
Only Sally joins him, but her motive is not pure; she is doing it for the object of her affection, Linus, while Linus is doing it for his god. In the end, she too betrays him, leaving him chattering in the cold, waiting for what will never arrive.
Lucy retrieves her brother at 4 a.m., leads him home and puts him to bed. In one of the most tender moments ever captured on TV, she takes off his socks, for only when the feet are free can the spirit rest. Though Linus has been disappointed and his god has not risen, he sleeps the sleep of the righteous. It's the same sleep as that of the fisherman at the end of "The Old Man and the Sea"; he's spent and the sharks have devoured the marlin, but the prize was never the catch. It was the quest, the effort and the suffering.
In the final scene, Charlie Brown tries to console Linus about his wasted night in the pumpkin patch by saying, "I did a lot of stupid things in my life, too." This enrages Linus, who vows to find an "even more sincere" pumpkin patch next year. Experience is no match for faith.
For many viewers, the special might offer a pagan vision. Schulz himself, who taught Sunday school and clearly drew on Christianity in constructing the scenario (Gethsemane, death and resurrection), didn't shy away from this interpretation. As described in David Michaelis's biography "Schulz and 'Peanuts,"' the artist once responded to a letter writer by agreeing with her assertion that the Great Pumpkin was "sacrilegious." His intent, he wrote, was to use the pumpkin deity as a metaphor for Santa Claus.
John Updike dismissed "The Great Pumpkin" as "travesty if not blasphemy." Not long ago, I came across a sermon online that used the special to demonstrate the fate of those who worship false gods. Linus follows a nature god instead of Jesus, and look where it leaves him? Chattering alone in the cold.
According to the sermon, "Linus's belief is one of the most common beliefs about religion: It does not matter what a person believes in. As long as they are sincere in their belief, the object of their faith is irrelevant and their faith is legitimate. Because the Great Pumpkin never shows, Schulz, simply and brilliantly, communicates sincerity is worthless if the object of faith is false."
But to me, the sincerity in "The Great Pumpkin" is key and is what has drawn me to its magic year after year. It's what you believe but also the sincerity of that belief that can give your life meaning. Sincere belief can order an otherwise formless succession of days, and it is meaningful days, collected together, that add up to a meaningful life.

Texto completo: Another one down, 17 to go.
As we move further into fall, the Democratic primary field is very, very slowly beginning to shrink. That is leaving behind a trail of people who have lived through the unique -- and totally bizarre -- experience of running for president.
We were curious to hear what it's really like from the inside. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who ended his presidential bid last week, was generous enough to grant us an exit interview.
Here's what he had to say about where he sees the race going, why his bid didn't take off and all that campaign food. (Our conversation has been edited and condensed.)
So you recently did something kind of crazy, which was run for president. What was the coolest part?
The energy on the ground and the excitement and the different events and all of that stuff. And obviously, the debates were pretty cool. I mean, I'm just a kid from Ohio. To kind of actually be in the mix of all that was really cool.
I'm reminded of how much you eat on a campaign. It was the pork chops wrapped in bacon at the Iowa fair. We spent a lot of time in South Carolina and I think I put on about 10 pounds in South Carolina alone. And so, that's always fun.
The thing about it is that people are just people, and you can be in Ohio in my area of Youngstown or Akron, or you can be in Greenville, S.C., or Davenport [Iowa], and it's amazing how most people just have the same basic concerns.
What did you learn from the experience?
Because you've never done it before, every day's a learning opportunity. From how you organize your campaign, how you organize your message, how you strategize and plan and prioritize. The intensity of the presidential race is that it is all happening at the same time. It's just completely engaging at all levels.
Just in the last few days, my body is starting to calm down, my mind is starting to calm down. Now, it's like, I'm literally teaching my son how to tie his shoe. And I just laugh and I'm like, "Wow, this is hilarious, right?" You go from running for president to teaching your 5-year-old kid how to tie his shoe.
So, why do you think your campaign didn't hit?
I didn't have the money. I knew I wasn't going to have what everybody else had. But I thought at some point people would start seeing me as the person who could best beat Trump. But what happened was the donors weren't there. They weren't going out of their comfort zone to me. They were going to give to people that they knew. A lot of them weren't going to bet on a dark horse.
Where do you think your voters go?
I don't know. A lot of them are calling me and asking me. I say, keep your powder dry.
Is that your plan, too?
I want to be a part of shaping the race. I've got calls and conversations from almost all of the top people in the race. But we're just going to kind of hang loose for a little bit.
To me it's like, who can win? For everybody, it's got to absolutely be who can beat Donald Trump and who can beat him in the states we need to win. That was my motive for running because I thought it was me. But I think that's got to be it. Who can win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. Put Ohio in play and make them play there. And, potentially, Florida.
Do you regret running?
No, not at all. The more you process everything and you start to integrate the lessons of the last year and a half, you can't get that kind of experience. It would take 20 years in Congress to accumulate the level of experience that running for president brings you.
Now, you can take that back to Congress for the impeachment proceedings.
Right back into the [expletive] show. Jeez, oh man, I thought they'd have it all taken care of by the time I got back.

Warren's Answer on Medicare for All
Our colleague Ellen Barry is on the trail with Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire this week, and sends us this dispatch:
When will you release a detailed plan explaining how you propose to pay for "Medicare for all"?
That question was lobbed repeatedly at Senator Elizabeth Warren this afternoon -- including by a voter in the audience -- as she addressed a packed hall at the University of New Hampshire.
Her answer, delivered repeatedly and with conviction: "Soon."
Ms. Warren has faced mounting questions in recent weeks over whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help pay for a single-payer health care system. For months, she has said she supported Senator Bernie Sanders's Medicare for all plan without specifying how she would finance it. Only last week did she say she would release a plan to do so.
When pressed by reporters after the event today, she offered some insight into what was taking so long.
"I continue to work on parts of it that need more information," she said. "One of them is talking about what the cost is. You may know the cost of Medicare for all estimates vary by trillions and trillions of dollars."
She added that she would be happy to consult with Mr. Sanders, her leading progressive rival in the Democratic presidential race, on how to pay for Medicare for all, but had not yet done so. Mr. Sanders has said he would raise taxes on the middle class to fund a health insurance system that would eliminate almost all out-of-pocket costs.
Ms. Warren also brushed away the suggestion that frustration over her health care plan was beginning to hurt her campaign.
"I don't see it as flak, I see it as people who are wrestling with the question of how we can make sure that Americans get covered by health care," she said. "It's the other side, the Republicans, who think it's just fine."
Concerns over paying for health care were just a blip among the fleece-and-water-bottle crowd today. The audience, standing 10 deep around the edges of the room, came to life when Ms. Warren arrived at the climax of her speech, about her plans to dole out the proceeds from a 2 percent wealth tax on the richest Americans.
The candidate provided extra evidence that her plan was catching on, noting that in Laconia on Tuesday, she had met "two little girls" who were planning to dress as 2 cents for Halloween.
______
... Seriously
In my small-child-dominated household, we are well into Day 5 of Halloween -- a holiday my colleague Jessica Grose over at Parenting likes to call "preschool Mardi Gras."
She might be on to something, at least among parents: Polling by Monmouth University says only 8 percent of Americans call the holiday their "most favorite."
But the real winner of this poll? Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, by far, is the top pick for favorite candy. (That's definitely a platform I can support!)

Texto completo: University officials described the decision as one step in a dialogue with the descendants, who are seeking $ 1 billion.
Joining a wave of American institutions moving to offer a measure of restitution for their ties to slavery, Georgetown University announced on Tuesday that it would raise about $ 400,000 a year to benefit the descendants of the 272 enslaved people who were sold to help keep the college afloat nearly two centuries ago, officials said.
The university plans to use the money to support community projects such as health clinics and schools. The announcement came six months after Georgetown students voted in a nonbinding referendum to impose student fees that would have raised about $ 400,000 a year to support the descendants.
Georgetown officials said students would play "a substantial role" in the new initiative but would not be required to pay additional fees. The university plans to seek voluntary contributions from alumni, faculty, students and philanthropists.
"We embrace the spirit of this student proposal," wrote John J. DeGioia, Georgetown's president, in a letter to the university community, adding that officials would "ensure that the initiative has resources commensurate with, or exceeding the amount that would have been raised annually through the student fee."
Georgetown officials described the decision as one step in a dialogue with the descendants, who are seeking $ 1 billion for a foundation that would finance educational, health, housing and other needs. Dr. DeGioia said the university would continue to participate in those talks along with the Jesuits, who established and ran Georgetown and organized a slave sale in 1838 to help save the college from foundering.
Conversations about reparations for slavery have spread in just a few years from activist circles to college quads to the halls of Congress. Georgetown is the third institution to take such a step in the past two months. This month, Princeton Theological Seminary announced it would spend $ 27 million on scholarships and other initiatives to make amends for its ties to slavery.
In September, Virginia Theological Seminary, which relied on enslaved laborers, created a $ 1.7 million reparations fund. And last year, the Catholic sisters of the Society of the Sacred Heart created a reparations fund to finance scholarships for African-Americans in Grand Coteau, La., where the nuns had owned about 150 black people.
At Georgetown, college officials relied on Jesuit plantations in Maryland to help finance the school's operations, university officials said. The 1838 sale -- worth about $ 3.3 million in today's dollars -- was organized by two of Georgetown's early presidents, both Jesuit priests.
Dr. DeGioia said the university would begin funding community programs in 2020 and described the new fund as part of the university's efforts "to respond to the question: How do we address now, in this moment, the enduring and persistent legacies of slavery?"
But Shepard Thomas, a descendant of an enslaved couple sold in 1838 and a student leader who helped organize the spring referendum, criticized the decision to raise the money through charitable contributions instead of student fees.
On Wednesday, he and other student leaders issued a statement saying that Georgetown's plan "delegitimizes and undermines student effort and the democratic vote of the undergraduate student body" and "contains no clear criteria, accountability measures or transparency with regards to construction or implementation."
In an interview, Mr. Thomas said he feared that descendants would ultimately end up with less financial support, and noted that the university's plan would not allow individual descendants to receive assistance with medical bills, housing or scholarships.
"That isn't sufficient," he said.

Impeachment Investigators Summon Bolton, Who Indicates He Won't Appear Voluntarily

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — House impeachment investigators on Wednesday summoned John Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, to testify next week about a shadowy effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the president's domestic political rivals, closing in on a critical witness as they deepen their inquiry.
But Bolton's lawyer responded by saying that Bolton was “not willing to appear voluntarily," declining to specify what his client would do should he be subpoenaed. The possibility of Bolton's appearance set up what could be a marquee interview of the House's month-old impeachment inquiry, featuring a fiery foreign policy veteran who is said to have been deeply alarmed by what he saw unfolding around him with regard to Ukraine.
His deputies have testified that Bolton, who left the White House in September amid disagreements with the president, resisted Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations of Democrats and warned that Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, was a “hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up."
Many Democrats regard Bolton as an ideal witness, a respected conservative national security hawk who was nonetheless incensed by how the president and his inner circle were treating Ukraine and who broke sharply with the president upon his departure from the White House.
If Bolton is subpoenaed, his lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, is likely to ask a federal judge to determine whether his client needs to comply.
Cooper, who also represents Charles Kupperman, Bolton's former White House deputy, advised him not to comply with a subpoena to appear this week after the White House intervened. Instead, he filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge whether he should testify in the impeachment inquiry. A hearing on that matter is scheduled for Thursday at the US District Court in Washington. Bolton could take a similar course.
At the same time they called Bolton, House Democrats dispatched requests to a senior White House lawyer, John Eisenberg, and his deputy, Michael Ellis, who could offer important insight into the events under scrutiny. Eisenberg fielded concerns from Bolton's deputies about demands being placed on Ukraine and helped move a transcript of a now-famous July phone call between Trump and Ukraine's leader into a secure server that limited who could see it.
“Based upon public reporting and evidence gathered as part of the impeachment inquiry, we believe that you have information relevant to these matters," three Democratic committee leaders wrote in a short letters to all three men. The letters did not include subpoenas.
Eisenberg and Ellis could face similar decisions about whether to satisfy the White House directives or congressional demands. As White House lawyers, they could also be subject to certain special privilege claims to shield their testimony from Congress.
The subpoenas came as Democrats set the stage Wednesday for certain House approval of the ground rules lawmakers will use when they consider impeaching Trump. There was no doubt that the Democratic-controlled body would approve the eight pages of procedures on Thursday.
"As much as this president flaunts the Constitution, we are going to protect it," House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, Democrat of Worcester, said as his panel debated the procedures.
Meanwhile, investigators spent the day sequestered in the closed chambers of the House Intelligence Committee with two foreign service officers who specialized in Ukraine.
One of them testified that Robert Livingston, a former Republican congressman turned lobbyist, repeatedly told her when she was assigned to the White House that the US ambassador to Ukraine should be fired because of her association with Democrats.
The officer, Catherine M. Croft, testified that she “documented" multiple calls from Livingston about the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, while she was working at the National Security Council from mid-2017 to mid-2018. She said that she informed two other officials — Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the council, and George P. Kent, a Ukraine expert at the State Department — about them at the time.
“He characterized Ambassador Yovanovitch as an 'Obama holdover' and associated with George Soros," she said, referring to the billionaire liberal philanthropist, according to a copy of Croft's opening statement reviewed by The New York Times. “It was not clear to me at the time — or now — at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch."
The testimony adds to a timeline of known attacks on Yovanovitch by conservatives questioning her loyalty to Trump. It is not clear if Livingston's work, or those financing it, were in any way connected to efforts by two Americans with business interests in Ukraine who wanted her gone and, later, by Giuliani. Nor did Croft have anything to say about whom else Livingston spoke with.
Livingston and his firm did not reply to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Still, the outreach is certain to interest impeachment investigators, who are scrutinizing smears against Yovanovitch to understand if they were part of a larger pressure campaign by Trump and Giuliani to secure from Ukraine politically beneficial investigations into Democrats. Trump eventually recalled her this spring from Kyiv, months ahead of schedule, but the ambassador was told he had been intent on removing her since the summer of 2018.
Croft was questioned Wednesday by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform committees, which are leading the inquiry into whether Trump abused his power to pressure Ukraine to target his political rivals. She and a second witness, Christopher Anderson, served as advisers to Kurt Volker, the United States' former special envoy to Ukraine, and in other diplomatic capacities related to that country. Anderson preceded Croft as Volker's adviser.
Investigators were expected to press both officers to confirm aspects of testimony given earlier by Volker and fill in details about his work trying to manage the demands of Trump and Giuliani on the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Both witnesses were instructed by the State Department not to cooperate with the investigation but appeared anyway after receiving subpoenas for testimony.
According to a copy of his opening statement, Anderson testified that he and Volker worked to steer clear of Giuliani as they tried to help Ukraine's new government root out corruption in general and deepen its ties to the United States — but bumped up against him again and again.
In his testimony, Anderson planned to describe a June 13 meeting at the White House with Volker and Bolton, then Trump's national security adviser, in which Bolton indicated Giuliani could pose a problem as they sought to build more support for Zelensky among senior White House officials.
“He cautioned that Mr. Giuliani was a key voice with the president on Ukraine, which could be an obstacle to increased White House engagement," Anderson planned to say.

Daily on Healthcare, presented by SBEC: Appeals court decision could sow confusion during open enrollment

5TH CIRCUIT DECISION CASTS SHADOW OVER OBAMACARE OPEN ENROLLMENT: A decision by a federal appeals court threatens to strew confusion among Obamacare shoppers if it lands during open enrollment.
The sign-up period for Obamacare is set to begin Friday, and a decision from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals over whether the law should be thrown out is expected any day. Shoppers have until Dec. 15 to make changes to their plans or to newly enroll, and some people are likely to be confused about whether the law is still in effect if a decision lands within those six weeks.
A decision from the 5th Circuit could result in the lawsuit going back to the lower courts (buying the Trump administration more time) or appealed to the Supreme Court (bringing Obamacare front and center ahead of the 2020 election). The lawsuit questions whether the zeroing out of the fine on the uninsured, part of the Republican tax overhaul, is key to Obamacare working. Republicans, including the Trump administration, argued that the penalty was central to making the rest of the law work, and that without it, the rest should crumble.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said that the Trump administration would ask for a stay, meaning that Obamacare would remain operating regardless of what happens next in the litigation process. But that doesn’t mean customers won’t be puzzled anyway.
Let’s rewind one year, to when Obamacare was weighed in the lower courts. Federal Judge Reed O’Connor issued his decision on Obamacare, declaring it unconstitutional, on Dec. 14, just one day before open enrollment closed. Health officials immediately told the public that the law was still operating, but they also didn’t extend the deadline to sign up for coverage.
After several years of studying open enrollment, experts have noted that customers tend to procrastinate, so supporters of Obamacare feared enrollment would drop in light of O’Connor’s decision. Even though pro-Obamacare groups say enrollment could have been much higher than it is now if it hadn’t been for the lawsuit or other actions by the Trump administration, it turns out enrollment fell only slightly.
Much of this is thanks to one feature that helps bolster final enrollment rates: Current customers who do nothing by the end of open enrollment won't lose coverage, but will be automatically placed into the same plan or a similar one.

AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY URGES SENATORS TO VOTE AGAINST OBAMACARE RESOLUTION: The conservative group is asking members to vote against the resolution to undo Trump administration guidance on Obamacare 1332 waivers, which allow states to make changes to their healthcare systems. Democrats are set to force a vote Wednesday as part of a messaging strategy in which they’ll accuse Republicans who don’t vote in favor of the resolution of being uncommitted to rules protecting patients with pre-existing conditions. AFP says the waiver guidance is helpful for states to have flexibility and be able to lower premiums.
PRAF COMES OUT IN SUPPORT OF SENATE PALLIATIVE CARE BILL: The Patient Rights Action Fund, an organization that opposes the legalization of assisted suicide, sent a letter to Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee leaders this week urging them to take up the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act to increase access to palliative care. Matt Valliere, the group’s executive director, said in a letter that the group supported the bill to improve end-of-life care because “truly compassionate multidisciplinary palliative care is designed to treat the suffering of both the patient and their family – whether it be physical, emotional, psychological, existential, financial – and does not allow patients to be abandoned in their most vulnerable moments.”
CALIFORNIA TAKES TRUMP’S ‘RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCE’ RULE TO COURT: The California Department of Justice is arguing its case Wednesday against the Trump administration’s rule to protect medical workers with religious objections from being forced to provide or refer to abortion, sterilization, or medically assisted suicide. Deputy attorneys general Neli Palma and Stephanie Yu filed a motion last month to block the rule permanently, rather than postponing it from being enforced.
Liberal legal groups sued the Trump administration over the rule in May, called it a “denial of care rule.” They argued that the rule, set to go into effect Nov. 22, would violate patients’ rights to free speech and "endangers patients’ health in the name of advancing the religious beliefs of those who are entrusted with caring for them."
FEDERAL JUDGE TEMPORARILY BLOCKS ALABAMA ABORTION LAW: U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson, a Carter appointee, placed a preliminary injunction on Alabama’s near-total ban on abortions, the nation’s strictest abortion law to date. He wrote in his opinion Tuesday that the law, initially set to go into effect in November, "contravenes clear Supreme Court precedent," and violates a woman’s right to privacy.
SANDERS SAYS HE DOESN’T NEED A FUNDING PLAN FOR ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ YET: Presidential candidate and supporter of "Medicare for all" Bernie Sanders said he doesn’t have to put out “an exact detailed plan” for financing the proposed single-payer health system.
PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT APOLOGIZES MONTHS AFTER HARASSING PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROTESTERS: Pennsylvania state representative Brian Sims issued an apology to the family he harassed outside of a Planned Parenthood in April, having told his social media following to dig into the protesters' personal lives. The Democrat promised his followers that he’d give the person to publish the private information $100. Sims did not apologize to Ashley Garecht, her two teen daughters, and one of their friends until this week. Following the apology, Republican Pennsylvania representative Jerry Knowles withdrew a House resolution to formally censure Sims. “It’s sad that it took more than five months for Rep. Sims to acknowledge he did something very wrong, but he did finally apologize to the people he bullied, harassed and doxed at the Philadelphia abortion clinic,” Knowles said.

Texto completo: Kamala Harris is cutting dozens of staffers from her headquarters in Baltimore and shifting resources to Iowa in an attempt to revive her struggling campaign.
Harris's campaign is bleeding cash as she continues to fall in Democratic presidential primary polls, according to Politico. Almost all of her operations in states such as California, Nevada, and New Hampshire will be impacted by the campaign overhaul.
Along with the staffing cuts, campaign advisers and top campaign officials such as campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, who made $10,000 a month from July through September, will take pay cuts.

"From the beginning of this campaign, Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal — to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. This requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks," Rodriguez said in a memo obtained by Politico. "Plenty of winning primary campaigns, like John Kerry’s in 2004 and John McCain’s in 2008, have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination, and this is no different."
Harris's national polling average has dipped since a high of about 15% in July. She now hovers at around 5% and has been passed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Harris also trails behind Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren.

Texto completo: A rooster crows as Ángela, a Mexican woman in a purple apron, takes her place beside a wood-fired grill to teach us how to make gorditas, corncakes plump with fillings. “Hola, mi gente bonita," she greets us. Hello, my beautiful people. Doña Ángela — no one seems to know her last name, only that she lives somewhere in Michoacán — is the host of De Mi Rancho a Tu Cocina, a YouTube cooking channel that has amassed 1.5 million subscribers since its launch two months ago. (The name translates to “From My Ranch to Your Kitchen.") As the host pats corn dough between her palms with evident satisfaction, we hear children chattering in the background; perhaps that, combined with her kind, lined face, is why she is always referred to as an abuela (grandmother) or some fond variant thereof — e.g. “tiny abuelita," in a Vice story that notes “a distinct ASMR vibe" to her soothing videos.
Meanwhile, over on Instagram, 114,000 people have watched a video of Lan Lin — a.k.a. “Mama Lin," the 70-something mother of food blogger Lisa Lin — wrap and fry spring rolls. The YouTube channel Pasta Grannies (431,000 subscribers) spawned a cookbook out in the US this week, “Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy's Best Home Cooks," featuring recipes from more than 70 nonne for pici, trofie with pesto, and the like. Pasta Grannies was featured recently in The New York Times, which last year ran an obituary for Mastanamma, an Indian great-grandmother who died at 107 with more than a million subscribers to Country Foods, the YouTube channel where she documented recipes for tamarind rice, chicken curry, and whole lamb biryani.
It is true that grandmothers have always cooked, and that we have always loved to watch them. But now the grandmothers doing the cooking are not necessarily our own, and we are turning up in droves to learn their family recipes. Granny cooking has found a new frontier — the electronic range — and women who came of age before the Internet existed are being celebrated online for their culinary prowess.
“I talk about my mother to my friends a lot and they find her funny," says Lisa Lin, a former lawyer whose mother supports her career change while not always understanding it. “I thought: Why don't I record her making peanut candy and post it online? I got such a great reaction from my audience, more so than I've ever had before. It turns out a lot of people really enjoy watching my mom cook."
This is understandable. Mama Lin's mooncakes, dumplings, and garlicky green beans look delicious, and her technique is impeccable. The only route to hand-shaping tapered silver-needle noodles so effortlessly is years and years of practice. In her De Mi Rancho a Tu Cocina videos, Ángela brings us into the garden to pick vegetables with her before cooking them in bright enamelware with “poquita sal": Who needs exact measurements? (Or potholders, for that matter? Ouch.) A comment on a Pasta Grannies video, in which 96-year-old Pierina rolls out strudel dough until you can see the tablecloth's pattern through it, reads: “I'm a cook for over 40 years and [I'm] feeling as green as hell. This is art."
It is. In an age when cookbook publishers rarely pay to have recipes tested, and the reliability of those found online is a crapshoot, it is comforting to see something prepared by hands that have prepared it hundreds of times over decades. Does this recipe work? There's no question about it.
But more than that, there is a nostalgic appeal. We like to think of grandmothers as figures who exist for the purpose of nourishing and nurturing us, a notion that may never have been quite so simple in reality. Regardless, it's awfully hard to spend all day making chicken potpies from scratch when your high-powered job keeps you late at the office. The grandma of yore is an endangered species, here on earth but for a short time more.
“Every generation has nostalgia for the generation before," says Anastasia Miari, a UK-based journalist who with creative director Iska Lupton is working on a project called Grand Dishes, documenting the stories and recipes of grandmothers from around the world. “Our lives are so fast-paced and saturated with instant gratification. . . . Especially in cities, young people, or millennials, or snowflakes [laughs], we seem to not have time to cook, not have time to feed ourselves, not have time to take care of our mental health. We're all suffering from burnout. The simple lives our grandparents live are now attracting us. We're learning maybe that's a better way to live."
Grand Dishes will culminate in a cookbook of the same name that Miari and Lupton aim to have out for the holidays next year. They have spent time with grannies from Sicily, Cuba, Hong Kong, Eritrea, and more; this week they set out on a US road trip. First stop: New York restaurant Enoteca Maria, which has a rotating menu prepared not by trained chefs but by grandmothers from around the world, serving up dishes from their own cultures. As with most people who set out to preserve these recipes, Miari and Lupton were inspired by their own grandmothers, from Greece and Germany, respectively.
“These are the last generation of women that won't have had their lives recorded in the way we record our lives now," Miari says. “These stories and recipes might be lost forever if we're not around to take them down or inherit them."
Even for those who don't cook, these videos have appeal. They feed our wanderlust with glimpses of cultures and countries we may never visit ourselves. At the same time, they show us how universal our relationships are. In a scene from Ángela's rancho, she shells beans with one of her daughters. Each makes eye contact with the camera, and their expressions are suffused with love and its complex accompaniments: frustration, tolerance, pride.
There is a tendency, when we talk about older people in this society, to simplify and condescend — to reduce complicated, fully realized human beings to “cute" grandmas and grandpas. Videos of grandmothers cooking upend these notions subversively. Sure, there's your sweet little nonna making delicious food. But she's also racking up the views and the likes (so much for olds who don't know their way around computers), finally being rewarded in one way or another for all those years of uncompensated labor.
Perhaps the most satisfying viral video of them all features 86-year-old culinary grande dame and actress Madhur Jaffrey. Although she has written many seminal Indian cookbooks, this happens to be a music video, by hip-hop artist Mr. Cardamom. The song, “Nani," is a tribute to his maternal grandmother, played by Jaffrey. It does begin with her in the kitchen, getting chewed out by an ungrateful son. But before you know it, she's dropping F bombs, knocking all her supplements to the floor, applying red lipstick, and fanning herself with a wad of cash as she smokes a cigarette. “I'm the best damn Nani that you ever done seen," she snarls. Believe it. The video has more than 100,000 views.

Californians should favor dam expansion plan: Tom Campbell

Texto completo: The Public Policy Institute of California, one of the most respected, neutral research institutes in our state, reports that more than a third of all the water that falls on California in the form of rain or snow flows to the Pacific Ocean.
This constitutes a greater percentage of our water than agriculture, industrial and urban uses combined. The next largest destination for California’s water is environmental, which also exceeds all that is consumed by agriculture, industrial and urban use combined. Together, water going to environmental uses and water flowing to the ocean make up two-thirds of all California’s water.
Last year, California ended its drought. Meteorologists predict this rainy season will also be plentiful. In our state, however, drought is always just a few years away. In 1952, California’s greatest chronicler, John Steinbeck, commented that, “During the dry years, the people forgot about the rich years, and when the wet years returned, they lost all memory of the dry years. It was always that way.”
Sixty-seven years later, perhaps California can finally become far-sighted. During an extra rainy year, California could put some of the water that would otherwise flow to the ocean in storage against the next drought.
The effects of the last drought are still obvious in California’s agricultural belt.
Making a map of the 20 counties of California whose unemployment exceeds the statewide average is to draw the outline of our state’s agricultural region. In an unbroken thread north of Sacramento almost to the Oregon line, Sutter, Glenn and Tehama counties all exceed the state’s unemployment average. Going south from Sacramento to Los Angeles, San Joaquin, Stansilaus, Merced, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern counties form a continuous strip of above-average unemployment. All are agricultural counties.
The drought forced farmers to fallow fields of row crops and to uproot almond and fruit trees. Farmers are hesitant to replant, uncertain about the restoration of water supplies. Those who suffer most live at the edges of the economy of agriculture: those who plant the crops, harvest them, sell the feed, fuel and farm supplies to furnish the most productive farm land in the world, if there is water.
From this perspective, the federal government’s plan to increase the storage capacity of Lake Shasta, created by the Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River, is both sensible and compassionate.
The project is feasible because the dam was constructed in 1945 in such a way as to allow for raising its height, in response to the need for water that was foreseen to grow, a project tremendously easier than building a new dam in a different location. Heightening the Shasta Dam would not impede any of California’ free-flowing streams, as new storage projects might. The higher dam will increase Lake Shasta’s available water by 14%.
The New York Times nevertheless criticized this project: “For years, the Interior Department resisted proposals to raise the height of its towering Shasta Dam in Northern California. The department’s own scientists and researchers concluded that doing so would endanger rare plants and animals in the area, as well as the bald eagle, and devastate the West Coast’s salmon industry downstream.”
In the past, the federal government had allowed California fields to crack and go parched, on behalf of “rare plants and animals in the area,” which inhabit some land that would now be underwater behind the dam.
How much land? The answer is less than 5% of the land originally affected by the dam. Downstream salmon can be completely protected by filling the extra capacity of Lake Shasta only during times of water surplus, thus causing no diminution in normal downstream flow.
How the bald eagle fits in is harder to understand, except as an obscure appeal to patriotism. The Department of Interior under its new secretary has reversed that policy, and the dam construction is beginning. The New York Times is dismayed; Californians should rejoice.
Tom Campbell is a professor of economics and law at Chapman University. He was California’s finance director, a state senator and a five-term congressman. He is one of the founders of the Common Sense Party, a new political party in California.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump expresó su rechazo del testimonio del teniente coronel Alexander Vindman , un experto de Ucrania asignado al Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, quien testifica en la Cámara sobre la llamada del mandatario al presidente ucraniano.
“Supuestamente, según los Medios Corruptos, el testigo de hoy que nunca ha sido trumpista calificó de ‘preocupante’ la llama a Ucrania. ¿Estaba en la misma llamada que yo? ¡No puede ser posible! Pídanle que lea la transcripción de la llamada. ¡Cacería de brujas!” , escribió el mandatario.
Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call “concerned” today’s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019
The New York Times adelantó que Vindman alertó sobre las peticiones del mandatario republicano a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky , para investigar al exvicepresidente Joe Biden y a su hijo Hunter , por una indagatoria supuestamente cancelada por la participación del segundo en una empresa gasera de Ucrania.
A cambio, la Administración Trump asignaría recursos militares y prepararía una reunión de ambos mandatarios en la Casa Blanca.
Vindman es el primer testigo de esta primera parte del proceso de juicio político que escuchó la llamada del 25 de julio entre los presidentes Trump y Zelensky, durante la cual Trump dijo que quería un “favor”, luego de que el ucraniano sacara el tema de casi $400 millones de dólares en ayuda militar estadounidense prometida.
El teniente coronel estaba escuchando desde la Sala de Situación junto con otros funcionarios de Seguridad Nacional y personal del vicepresidente Mike Pence , dijo en declaraciones preparadas.
Agregó que le parecía que la acción era preocupante y que podría verse como “un juego partidista que podría afectar la seguridad nacional de los EEUU.

Hometown important to Chicago Cubs manager Ross

Texto completo: David Ross has returned to Chicago and Wrigley Field as the Cubs' 55th manager in team history. However, his Florida Panhandle hometown represents family and friendships and remains important to him.
"I think Tallahassee has had a huge impact on who I am and the qualities I get a lot of praise for," Ross told the Democrat. "Along with my amazing parents, this town has shaped who I am as a person and the things I value."
Ross, 42, held his first press conference Monday at Wrigley Field as the Cubs new manager.
The organization officially announced his hiring last week, signing their former catcher, special assistant in the front office and ESPN analyst to a three-year contract with an option for a fourth.
Though Ross has never managed before, he explained Monday that there "are many ways to get experience. But I am ready for this. .. I know what winning looks like." Ross also said he had been preparing for the opportunity to manage his entire career.
Former Auburn baseball coach Hal Baird, who signed Ross out of Florida High in 1995, always believed Ross would be an ideal managerial candidate. Though Ross played at Auburn for only two seasons before he transferred to Florida, Baird said the player's impact was clearly felt.
"David's one of the very few people I ever coached , or was ever around, who truly made the players around him better," Baird said.
"I don't think I ever had a player who was more popular among his teammates. People may have seen him on (TV) and see that he's so affable, so personable and so engaging. The harder edge doesn't always come through. Believe me, he's one competitive son-of-a-gun.
"I am not surprised because I always thought it (being an MLB manager) might be an itch he'd have to scratch."
Ross plans to continue to live in Tallahassee in the offseason. He recently purchased a new home. His three young children and parents, who attended Monday's press conference, are in Tallahassee.
Ross can navigate the town without the fanfare that accompanies him on the road. He routinely plays golf with friends, favors Starbucks coffee and, for the past 12 years, has teamed with fellow Florida High alum Bryan Henry to hold a Father-Son Baseball Camp.
Ross' personality was also on display during the press conference. He mentioned his father David usually wears flip-flops but instead dressed up for the event.
"We don't look at him as a manager, we look at him as a son," said his mother Jackie. "It's amazing to see where he's come from to where he is today and how hard he's worked."
When Ross retired in 2016 to close out his 15-year MLB career, he didn't pause long to catch his breath. He finished second in the popular television show "Dancing With the Stars" and penned his best-selling autobiography with Tallassee resident and New York Times best-selling author Don Yaeger.
"The thing I most-often share when I'm asked working with David is what a high level of self-awareness he possesses," Yaeger explained.
"I don't find that in all the athletes I'm blessed to work with. He knows what he knows...and what he doesn't. He's open to coaching from others, especially on areas where he's trying to grow and develop. His self-deprecating humor immediately breaks down barriers, but then he legitimately locks in to whomever he's with."
Ross is replacing Joe Maddon, who led the Cubs to their first World Series title in more than a century in 2016. Ross, who also won a World Series crown with the Boston Red Sox, hit a home run in Game 7 to help the Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians three years ago.
While Ross stressed Monday he's willing to put in the time and effort to do the job in Chicago, Tallahassee won't be far away.
"Treating people with kindness and respect is something I learned at a young age and I try to hold on to those values daily," Ross said. "Family, friends, coaches, teachers, strangers at the gym, never lack a kind word or an influencing thought.
"Tallahassee is a huge part of me."
Editor's Note: Bryan Henry is Jim Henry's son. Jim also worked with Yaeger on Ross' autobiography.

Russia Hacked Agencies, Microsoft Says

Texto completo: The Russians were supposed to turn over their own computer data to avoid further penalties. Then they went on the offensive.
Russian state hackers attacked the computer networks of at least 16 national and international sports and antidoping organizations, Microsoft said Monday. The attacks are the latest in a series of brazen Russian cyberattacks on foreign politicians, sporting officials and antidoping regulators.
The attacks were timed as the World Anti-Doping Agency deals with the continued fallout from the 2015 Russian doping scandal, which snowballed in recent months after WADA officials discovered that Russian athletes' failed drug tests had been erased from a critical data set.
According to Microsoft, which helps protect some of the agencies from cyberattacks, the Russian attacks began Sept. 16, just days before WADA announced Russia might face further punishment for inconsistencies in its drug testing data. Microsoft did not name victims of the cyberattacks, but confirmed that some of the Russian attacks were successful.
The company traced the attacks to a group of notorious Russian state-backed hackers known by the alias Fancy Bear. The group is one of two Russian government groups responsible for the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee, as well as previous cyberattacks on sports and antidoping officials between 2014 and 2018. The attacks resulted in the 2018 indictment of seven Russian intelligence officers accused of hacking sports and antidoping officials, as well as spreading personal emails belonging to antidoping officials and the private medical records of Western athletes. The hacks occurred amid mounting criticism of Russia for its yearslong, state-sponsored doping program.
The latest Russian cyberattacks could factor into WADA's decision whether or not to punish Russia for possibly manipulating data at the center of the 2015 doping scandal. Russia's promise to turn over the data set was key to WADA's decision to lift a ban on Russia's antidoping agency in late 2018. That determination ended a three-year suspension of Russia's antidoping agency that had been imposed after the discovery of one of the most brazen cheating schemes in history, one that corrupted a number of major international sporting events, including several Olympics. As a result of the scandal, Russian athletes were barred from competing under their country's flag at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
In recent months, a WADA investigative team discovered inconsistencies between a data set it received from a whistle-blower in 2017 and data submitted by Russian officials last January. Failed drug tests had been deleted from the Russian data set. Last month, WADA officials gave the Russians three weeks to explain the discrepancies. WADA has yet to determine whether it will accept Russia's explanations.
A WADA spokesman said it was aware of Microsoft's disclosures Monday but said there was no evidence the agency's systems were breached in the attack.
Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said his organization sustained what seemed to be a deliberate brute force password attack in early October. "Nothing penetrated and we were in contact with all our community," Tygart said in a telephone interview Monday. He called the Fancy Bear attacks the "new normal."
Yury Ganus, the head of Russia's antidoping agency, said Monday that he had not been informed of any cyberattacks. Mr. Ganus told The New York Times earlier this month that he suspected Russian authorities were monitoring his phone calls and messages after he publicly claimed thousands of changes had been made to an athlete database to cover up failed drug tests. Mr. Ganus said the data issue "is the most critical since this doping crisis began."
Any punishment in the new WADA investigation could include the banning of Russian athletes from major international sports events.
"As the world looks forward with anticipation to the Tokyo Summer Games in 2020, we thought it important to share information about this new round of activity," Tom Burt, Microsoft's corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said in a statement on Monday.
Perhaps the most striking finding in the Microsoft report is this: The Russian state-run hacking group appears unembarrassed, even after being caught repeatedly.
The group often has been found hacking into a variety of organizations. It has been indicted. Its leaders have periodically been exposed. Microsoft has even gone to court to take over web domains created to lure those who fall for its tricks.
And yet, Fancy Bear continues its attacks unabated, striking out at what it perceives to be forces hostile to Russia, or those that are working to expose Russia's manipulation of doping testing. American intelligence officials have studied the repeated attacks on doping-related targets carefully, trying to draw lessons ahead of the 2020 presidential election -- a subject that captivates the Russians as much as the habits of its sports competitors.
In the latest case, Microsoft said Russia's hackers attacked targets through a combination malicious emails, fictional personas, stolen passwords and malware. In the past, the group has gone to great lengths to compromise its victims. In addition to the usual methods, Russia sent spies from Moscow to Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Summer Olympics and to Lausanne, Switzerland -- the seat of the international Olympic movement -- where they logged into the same hotel Wi-Fi networks used by antidoping officials investigating allegations of Russian doping.
Microsoft said Monday that it had alerted all customers targeted in the attack and was working with those who sought to help to secure compromised systems and accounts.

Hear the chant? That's what unites D.C.

Texto completo: Sorry, Nats.
Your erratic, sad/awesome/sad baseball performance is not what unites D.C.
And that became very clear in the third inning of Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night, when the crowd began chanting, "Lock him up!"
Abhorring President Trump is what unites D.C.
As Trump's presence was announced, the loud cheers for members of the military honored before him turned into a thundering "Boooooo" and then the "Lock him up" chant. A huge red banner that said "Impeach Trump!" was unfurled in the stands, and behind home plate, fans held a big blue sign: "Veterans for Impeachment."
Trump won just 4 percent of the District of Columbia vote in the 2016 election. Of course, many of the nearly 44,000 people in the stadium - with standing-room-only tickets surpassing the $1,000 mark - didn't actually live in D.C.
But first let's explain, once again, to the nation that D.C. is not the federal government. It is a town with plenty of people who were born, raised and educated here. It's not just this town. It's our town.
D.C. natives recoiled at a paragraph about the World Series in the New York Times over the weekend that hit all those D.C. tropes:
"Washington can be an isolating and serious place to live sometimes, considering the steady influx of tourists, the underlying tension of politics and the residents who come and go, depending on the administration. It's uncommon to meet a Washington native, and it takes a lot for Washingtonians to get excited about the same thing. Calling it a fun-loving city would be a stretch."
Go to a go-go or join the older folks hand-dancing at a wedding and see how fun-loving D.C. is.
Stop and groove a little to the bucket drummers, listen to those two kids playing trombone near the National Archives or watch the cars cruise Hains Point, and D.C. won't seem serious at all.
Witness the streets of D.C. the night Barack Obama was elected or the night Osama bin Laden was killed, and you'll know how excited this city can get.
Talk to the administrative assistants, the security guards or the scores of office workers in downtown D.C. who help run the place - and not just the lobbyist or lawyer who commutes in from Virginia and has garage parking as part of the employment package - and you'll meet plenty of Washington natives.
To be fair, recent census data shows that the majority of current D.C. residents are, indeed, transplants. Only about 28 percent of adults living in D.C. today were born here. And a map created by the D.C. Policy Center shows the stark contrast of where D.C. natives live, showing barely 2 percent of the population in Foggy Bottom as D.C.-born, while east of the Anacostia River, about 80 percent of the residents were born here.
But there are also transplants like me who are not transients, who have set roots in the city and birthed new D.C. natives. This is an American city, not just a white dome and dark suits. And it's time to remind folks across the nation of that as they worry that rooting for the Nationals means siding with the official Washington they love to hate.
Now, back to baseball.
There is no denying that the Nationals' fan base is largely white.
That's despite the fact that the last D.C. team to play in a World Series wasn't actually the 1933 Senators. It was the Homestead Grays, who dominated Negro League baseball for more than a decade straddling the 1930s and '40s.
Locals have lamented the weak presence of youth baseball in the city, especially east of the river. And that's what motivated Vincent Gray to push for the spectacular Washington Nationals Youth Baseball Academy to be constructed there in 2014, back when the current D.C. Council member was mayor.
Still, youth baseball leagues are expensive, and that ends up having an impact on sports fandom.
So it's easy to scan the stands in Nationals Park and find Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) or former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) among the out-of-town faces and know that the Nationals fans aren't totally representative of the place once known as Chocolate City.
Or you could just look at the conga line of Virginia plates in my D.C. neighborhood near the stadium all weekend to come to the same conclusion.
Yes, that stadium was filled with fans from Virginia, who have no major league team of their own. It was filled with transplants sent to Washington by American voters. It had Republicans and Democrats, lobbyists, lawyers, senators, journalists and others who had the money or influence to get their hands on a coveted ticket.
And when that stadium erupted in booing for Trump, they joined the 96 percent of D.C. voters outside the walls of that stadium in affirming the one thing nearly all Washington residents are united on.
D.C. is anything but divided on this.

Texto completo: Headnote The seminal film, while important for Native representation, relied on stereotypes
I remember watching Smoke Signals in Oklahoma City many years ago and thinking, "Yes! Finally, somebody has made a film about us, for us." I was 21 at the time. "Now they'll learn, and from an actual Indian screenwriter and director," I thought. But today, Smoke Signals feels clunky, even cringe-worthy. The film's creative team seems to have been inspired by the same impulses I had as a young idealistic kid: People didn't know anything about Indians, I was usually the first one they'd met, and I often felt the need to teach them a few things, whether they wanted to hear about them or not.
Since its release in 1998, Smoke Signals has become a seminal movie in Indigenous cinema and Indian Country. It was the first real Indigenous film, written, directed and largely acted by Indigenous people, and it did what no other Native film had done before: It successfully crossed over to mainstream. The film did well at the box office, grossing nearly $7 million, and was even added to the National Film Registry in 2018. But today, in light of our evolving notions of Indigeneity and what it means to be a Native person in this century, the film feels dated. One need look no further than the title card in the opening credits and the use of that damn Papyrus font.
Essentially a buddy picture - a road-trip movie about self-discovery - the film explores how Indians relate to American popular culture as well as to ourselves, along with the power of story and the lies we tell others within those frameworks. There is a missing father; there is alcoholism; there are notable rez accents. There is redemption.
Yet the film relies almost entirely on Western, pop-culture-influenced notions of Indigenous people, referencing classic Hollywood tropes about Indians being warriors or acting stoic, culminating in a musical number with a catchy song about John Wayne's teeth - a moment I'm still unclear about. At one point in the movie, Gary Farmer asks his son, "Who's your favorite Indian?" It's a ludicrous statement, written for a white audience, as if Indians sit around and think of themselves in this pop-culture way. Americans have always loved this kind of narrative, and the film often tries to "Indigenize" clichés for laughs, but in the end, Smoke Signals mines Indian stereotypes much the way Quentin Tarantino mines '70s exploitation cinema, only far less elegantly.
Smoke Signals is a film that constantly stops its own narrative to teach viewers how an Indian is supposed to act. It commits one of the cardinal sins of screenwriting in order to do so: It tells rather than shows. Still, as Janet Maslin of The New York Times put it, the movie's protagonists, Victor and Thomas, played by Adam Beach and Evan Adams respectively, were "enormously likable characters." That meant that white people could discuss the film at dinner parties and feel good about themselves, while Indigenous people were just happy to see ourselves represented on the screen.
But even in the arena of representation, there is a rub: Smoke Signals employs ideas of Pan-Indianism so heavily that the writing feels downright lazy. It's not surprising, considering that author and screenwriter Sherman Alexie's prolific body of fiction and poetry regularly plays in this sandbox. By leaning away from any sense of a tribally specific identity, it manages to talk about Indians without really talking about Indians. Today, Indigenous cinema is best when it embraces specificity, or brings Indian Country into a popular genre rather than the other way around. Jeff Barnaby's (Mi'gMaq) upcoming film Blood Quantum recently screened at Cannes and may prove to be an exciting exercise in the zombie genre, while Navajo director Sydney Freeland has done a deep dive into various genres that have nothing to do with Indigenous themes.
Many of us who grew up watching and loving Smoke Signals grumble when we think of how influential we found a film that is based on short stories by Alexie, especially given that the prolific Spokane author's career has effectively been cancelled following allegations of sexual harassment. Yet the film remains alive in our collective memories. "Hey, Victor" is burned into our brains after viewing the film, and "Frybread Power" shirts can still be purchased.
When Smoke Signals hit theaters, Indigenous people were thirsty for representation. Hell, we're still thirsty. The lack of understanding of what it means to be Indigenous still looms large in American movie theaters. But we don't overcome it by playing into those stereotypes; at least we shouldn't anymore. When Smoke Signals was made, it was overdue. Necessary, even; many of us cried silently in the theater when we saw ourselves finally represented on the screen. But it would be disappointing to see a film like it made today.
Sidebar Today, in light of our evolving notions of Indigeneity and what it means to be a Native person in this century, the film feels dated. One need look no further than the title card in the opening credits and the use of that damn Papyrus font.

Texto completo: The sun was beginning to set at the Tanji fishing port, about 20 miles from the Gambian capital of Banjul.
Just offshore, dozens of colorfully painted fishing boats were turning to silhouettes, their crews offloading buckets of freshly caught barracuda and grouper. A thick crowd of fishermen, buyers and intermediaries from at least five different West African countries worked within an intricate commercial system that seemed inexplicable to me. Runners clicked out warnings as they torpedoed through the crowds, pushing wheelbarrows full to the brim with still twitching sea-life, and crumpled dalasi bills exchanged hands at a furious pace.
Just out of the main scrum, an argument broke out between four women.
"If you keep supporting him, we won't sell you any fish and we'll tell everyone to do the same," one shouted in Mandinka, with two others nodding in agreement, as my guide, Kemo Manjang, whispered a translation.
"I don't care," the other responded, her wrinkled face screwing up into a clear expression of rage. "If you don't leave me alone, I'll bring him back."
The "him" she was referring to is Yayeh Jammeh, the former dictator of Gambia who refused to give up the presidency after losing the election and wound up fleeing the country in 2017 as regional forces prepared to move against him.
During a 22-year reign of terror, opposition members and journalists disappeared overnight; a paramilitary group called the Junglers was given carte blanche to hunt down and kill suspected coup organizers and spies; and, among a host of other bizarre campaigns, at least 1,000 people were accused of witchcraft and forced to drink poisonous hallucinogenic substances as "cures." Jammeh has since found refuge in Equatorial Guinea, a country run by another megalomaniacal tyrant.
This drastic change has brought "a new era," as many Gambians I met called it. For decades, the country's coastline has been a winter escape for sun-starved northern Europeans and Britons. But the political changes have brought in more investment and opened up parts of the country to travelers seeking more than just beach resorts.
When my brother Nimesh and I stepped off the plane and waded into the sopping humidity that hangs over the country in late September, we encountered a country that was speaking about decades of national trauma for the first time.
Around the capital and beyond, people from all walks of life from market sellers to hotel staff to fishermen on break were glued to cellphones, televisions and radios. They were following the hearings of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission, a two-year process that began in January and is bringing perpetrators and victims of atrocities before a panel of investigators and lawyers to share their stories for the first time.
The snippets I heard in passing were haunting: a former Jungler finally admitted to shooting two civilians "straight in the stomach," after first claiming that he had fired a warning shot in the air, which went astray; former police officers recounted the direct orders they received to kidnap and torture suspected opposition activists; the heavy sobs of a mother who is still looking for her son. Roadside billboards promoted the mission of the TRRC, with messages like, "Dear Government: Our families need closure. When will you start searching for us?" It was a sobering backdrop.
While Jammeh is credited by his supporters for building the infrastructure that does exist, the country is far behind some of its neighbors, including Senegal, which encircles Gambia on three sides. This became clear upon leaving Banjul and the tourist zone around the beaches just west of the capital.
After hiring Manjang, an independent guide and taxi driver, for a two-night excursion to the more remote reaches of the River Gambia, which cuts through the length of the country, we hit our first hurdle before we'd even left the capital. With bridge construction costly, river crossings usually involve ferries - and ferries usually involve waiting. In our case, three hours. Many people - traders, day workers and shoppers - lose entire days to waiting.
We meandered around the port, seeking shade wherever we could, settling eventually in the shadow cast by an ancient-looking truck. The temperature and humidity rose, and then, when the ferry did eventually pull up, idleness turned into intense action. The crowd disembarked: women carried impossibly heavy buckets of mayonnaise and milk on their heads and vendors brought out carts of live chickens, sheep on leashes and suitcases full of clothes and shoes to sell in the capital.
When we eventually were loaded onto the ferry, the cars and people were packed so tightly that it was impossible to even open the car door. I tried not to think about the incident, 17 years ago, when a Senegalese ferry capsized and sunk off the coast of Gambia, killing almost 2,000 people.
Eventually, I dozed off in the unrelenting heat - like most of the cars I encountered in the country, this one's air conditioning had fizzled out years ago - and woke up as we approached the other side of the river. Five hours of travel; 10 miles traversed. This would be a long trip.
And it was, but it was also stunningly beautiful. A country of just 2 million people, Gambia is sparsely populated, and the daytime din of Banjul and its immediate surrounds quickly gave way to wide tracts of empty, bright green land. Baobabs dotted the horizon with gnarled branches that make the trees look like they're in perpetual pain. Colorful birds flew across the road at regular intervals. Family compounds of thatch-roof houses sat just off the main road, smoke billowing out of open-air kitchens.
We reached our destination, a guesthouse in Jan-janbureh - or Georgetown, its colonial name that's still in use - just as dusk set in. As in Senegal the week before, we had been told it was the "wrong time" to be in Gambia, especially upriver, as the area around the River Gambia National Park is known. The rainy season was in its final weeks, and though there was only one passing shower, the humidity made being outside for extended periods of time difficult. The mosquitoes were even more dangerous than usual. ("Everyone I know who has gotten malaria, has got it in September," Manjang told us.)
In fact, most accommodations were closed for the season. The five-star over-water cottages of Mandina Lodge in the Makasutu Cultural Forest near Banjul were shuttered until the end of October, and the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project, a conservation initiative deep in the national park, wasn't taking guests as it does for most of the year.
So, we had no option but a ramshackle hotel in Georgetown. A collection of hilariously decorated rooms (ours, inexplicably, had a blown up photo of a pair of loafers as the only wall art), Baobolong Camp sits on the shore of the River Gambia, but faces away from it. There was no air conditioning, just a ceiling fan the size of a dinner plate that did nothing but move around faint wisps of hot air. Our bathroom door hung off a single hinge, necessitating a careful game of lift-and-shove every time we wanted to go in and out. There were two bare mattresses covered by mosquito nets.

Local History: Clarks Summit Native Rose To Fame On TV, Film In Mid-20th Century

Texto completo: He played gunslingers and criminals, space voyagers and a lieutenant of the British Indian Army. He acted alongside Humphrey Bogart, Michael Landon and other household names in Hollywood.
Clarks Summit native Warren Stevens appeared in television and movies for more than four decades. And while he never achieved the name recognition of some of his co-stars, longtime Scranton Times reporter and columnist Joseph X. Flannery said Stevens “belongs in that category of persons who definitely have ‘made it’ in Hollywood.”
Born on Nov. 2, 1919, Stevens grew up on Highland Avenue and graduated from Clarks Summit High School in 1937. He played football, fenced and was a member of the yearbook staff.
After serving as an Air Force pilot in World War II, Stevens moved to New York to pursue an acting career, according to his March 30, 2012, obituary in The New York Times.
With several small roles on Broadway on his resume, Stevens moved to California and began earning roles in films and television series. One of his first was a 1951 action flick called “The Frogmen,” about a Navy underwater demolition team. Stevens played one of the main characters, Hodges.
From there, he worked fairly constantly until the mid-1980s, scoring mostly small roles on dozens of popular shows and films. His early credits include a reporter in “Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell,” Steve Burgess in “Red Skies of Montana,” Kirk Edwards in “The Barefoot Contessa,” two roles in the series “Alfred Hitchcock Presents,” and Lt. Doc Ostrow on “Forbidden Planet.”
Then, he was cast as a main character in a new television show, “The 77th Bengal Lancers.” Showing at 7 p.m. Sundays on NBC in 1956 and 1957, the show was about a fictional regiment of the British Indian Army cavalry.
Stevens hung his hopes of stardom on the show, according to a Scranton Times profile published Oct. 30, 1956, ahead of the series’ premiere. He spent time at a ranch to learn to ride “while lugging a seven-foot lance, sabre and pistols,” according to the article.
“Now a freelance actor, Warren could spring to the celebrity circle in the fascinating role of Lieutenant Storm. If he becomes identified with the part, like Jack Webb with Sergeant Friday, he’ll have it made,” the article said.
But CBS’s “Lassie,” which aired in the same time slot, buried “The 77th Bengal Lancers.” After six months, NBC executives canceled the series.
Undaunted, Stevens went on to play several characters on “Gunsmoke” and “Have Gun, Will Travel,” between 1957 and 1963; “Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea” between 1965 and 1967; “Bonanza” between 1965 and 1970; and “Ironside” between 1967 and 1975, according to his obituary.
He had smaller, mostly one-time roles on other popular TV shows, including “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,” “The Donna Reed Show,” “Tarzan,” the original “Star Trek” series, “Mannix,” “M.A.S.H.” and “The Twilight Zone,” according to IMDB.com.
Along the way, he married twice: first to Susan Huntington, with whom he had a son, and then Barbara Fletcher, with whom he had two more sons.
Stevens’ acting career slowed down considerably in the mid-1980s, though he did appear on an episode of “E.R.” in 2006. He died on March 27, 2012, at his home in Sherman Oaks, California. His cause of death was chronic lung disease, his publicist told The New York Times.

Texto completo: From the You Saw It Coming Dept.: Maybe you did see it. We weren't sure. The White House insider who last year wrote a critical, anonymous column about President Trump has a book coming out.
Due Nov. 19 is "A Warning." The writer remains anonymous, did not accept an advance payment and plans to donate some of the royalties to nonprofits that focus on government accountability and supporting truth-tellers in repressive countries, including the White House Correspondents' Association, said Matt Latimer, an agent for the writer. Latimer and colleague Keith Urbahn also represented ex-FBI head James Comey and ex-White House aide Cliff Sims for their memoirs. The publisher is Twelve.
The book will expand on the column - "I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration" - which ran in September 2018 in The New York Times. It described Trump's leadership style as "impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective" and noted that "his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back."
Reporter Philip Rucker wrote Tuesday, "There is no modern historical parallel for a firsthand account of a sitting president written in book form by an anonymous author." The author will discuss their reasons for anonymity, sources told him. (Washington Post)
Ronan Farrow's book "Catch and Kill," just released, initially was blacklisted by Amazon Australia. No longer. It and another online seller, Booktopia, had decided not to sell the book after receiving letters from the lawyer for the National Enquirer - whose former editor, Australian Dylan Howard, was one of Farrow's subjects. The primary one is Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein; Farrow says Howard helped protect Weinstein from negative publicity about his conduct toward women. Other sellers received letters but sold the book anyway. "Australia is increasingly being called the defamation capital of the world because of its strict and complex laws that favor complainants," the Times reports. (Publishers Lunch, The Guardian, NYT)
Higher ed and prison: Jane Buckingham, author of the "Modern Girl's Guide" advice books, was sentenced to three weeks in prison Wednesday for paying to have a test expert take the ACT for her son. She paid $50,000. One of her books: "The Modern Girl's Guide to Sticky Situations." (NYT)
Events: Dianne Tolliver signs "Living Through Troubled Times," 10 a.m. Saturday, and Sarah Newland signs "Extent" at 2 p.m. William & Mary Bookstore, Merchants Square, 345 Duke of Gloucester St., Williamsburg. 757-221-1651.

New and recent
"Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA" by Amaryllis Fox (Random House, 229 pp.). Mary Louise Kelly of NPR called the book fascinating and intriguing, and moving in its descriptions of how Fox had tried to reconcile her work with her family life. Some details, she said, stretch credulity, but it's all "impossible to fact-check." Partly because of the vivid details in the manuscript, people speculated publicly in the months before publication about whether the CIA would give its approval. The federal government in September had, after all, sued Edward Snowden for not submitting his memoir for review and publishing it without written approval. But Fox herself told NBC News that she had fictionalized details and said the CIA had requested only minor changes in the year-plus that it had had the document. (Publishers Lunch, NPR)

A character crisis?

Texto completo: The Navy SEAL commando force is the stuff of legend, lionized for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, rescuing an American sea captain from Somali pirates and fighting to the death in the mountains of Afghanistan in the "Lone Survivor" story.
This summer, however, the commander of this vaunted band of war fighters warned about an ethical and professional crisis in the ranks. "We have a problem," Rear Adm. Collin Green wrote in a letter to the troops. "Some of our subordinate formations have failed to maintain good order and discipline and as a result and for good reason, our (Naval Special Warfare) culture is being questioned."
There was cocaine abuse in a SEAL team based in Virginia. Two SEALs were accused of killing a U.S. soldier in a hazing in North Africa. Another SEAL allegedly raped an American female service member during a drunken party in Iraq.
And then there was the case of Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher.
A combat veteran with the nickname Blade – who said he craved combat and the chance to "kill as many people as possible," according to The New York Times – Gallagher was accused by members of his platoon of battlefield atrocities in Iraq while fighting the Islamic State terrorist group in 2017.
The allegations included shooting Iraqi civilians from a sniper's nest, firing indiscriminately into neighborhoods with a heavy machine gun, and using a custom-made knife to stab a teenage captive to death before posing with the corpse for a photograph.
The Navy was slow to investigate, and the prosecution's case began falling apart even before trial amid concerns about witness intimidation. Gallagher, who had become the darling of right-wing commentators, was acquitted in July on all charges except the one dealing with posing with a dead body.
According to The Times report, after Green began worrying about an anti-authority "Gallagher effect" infecting his elite force, an Instagram account belonging to Gallagher and his wife offered T-shirts with the phrase "Gallagher effect" and decried Green and another top leader as "a bunch of morons." Plans were drawn up to force Gallagher out of the SEALs based on new evidence of misconduct after unauthorized weapons, stolen equipment and illegal drugs were found in Gallagher's home and a work locker.
Then President Donald Trump entered the picture.
The commander in chief, who has advocated torture and taken a keen interest in pardoning troops convicted of war crimes, complained in a tweet this month that "we train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!"
He followed Gallagher's case, even discussing it with senior Navy officials. According to The Times, the Navy was faced with a dilemma: It could kick Gallagher out of the SEALs to help restore good order and discipline, but risk a reversal by Trump that would effectively emasculate SEAL leadership. So no action has been taken. And what Navy leaders most feared has likely come to pass: They've been shown powerless as the Gallagher effect undermines the unit's ethical code that "uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond."
Last week, former Navy SEAL and retired Adm. William McRaven – the highly respected architect of the bin Laden raid – reflected in a column about America's military ethos.
"The Greatest Generation went to war because it believed that we were the good guys," he wrote. "We are the most powerful nation ... because we try to be the good guys."
But with Gallaghers in the ranks and a president in their corner, is the United States still the good guys?

Texto completo: When reporters at The Minnesota Star Tribune discovered that infant deaths had significantly increased in the state's child care facilities, they published a series of articles that ended up driving changes in the law. They won a Pulitzer Prize in 2013 -- and within months the infant mortality rate had dropped. As someone married to a pediatrician and committed to investing in solving health challenges, I found this to be a powerful example of how journalism can help us make progress on our biggest issues.
I know what it's like to be the subject of reporting. I did my first interview at 19, and while I've gotten a little better at talking to journalists, people tell me I'm still not exactly a natural. Over the past 15 years, I've seen how the news has held Facebook accountable when we've made mistakes. This can be uncomfortable, but as I often tell Facebook's employees, this kind of scrutiny is important: Facebook is part of so many people's lives, and we have a responsibility to engage with good-faith criticism and use it to get better. Newspapers have broken important stories that have changed the way we operate, and ultimately that's better not only for our company, but also for society.
Great journalism surfaces stories that wouldn't have otherwise been uncovered, and it establishes the ground truth that helps us make progress on important issues. It also holds the powerful accountable. A free press is critical to a healthy democracy, and we need to support the journalists and publishers who do this critical work.
But the internet disrupted the business model for much of the news industry. When ads started moving from print newspapers to websites, the economics of news changed. Some effects have been positive. Internet services gave news outlets ways to reach new audiences, and research suggests people who get their news on social networks are exposed to a wider range of viewpoints. But breaking the link between publishers and their readers has also made it harder for the news industry to adapt financially to these changes.
For the past several years I've met with journalists, editors and publishers to better understand the challenges and opportunities faced by the news business. I know there's more we can and must do to help.
We started earlier this year, with a $ 300 million commitment to help publishers -- especially in local news -- invest in building their readership and subscription models. Local newspapers have been hardest hit by the technological changes, but they can have as much impact on people's daily lives as the major outlets do. We're supporting local reporting through the Pulitzer Center and funding journalists who are covering underreported topics in local newsrooms.
I've wanted to support journalism directly in our apps for a long time. But we've faced a dilemma trying to do more in the main News Feed because most of our community consistently tells us that they want to see more updates from their friends, family and communities, and less other content. For most people, social networks are still primarily about being social.
But over the past couple of years, we've started successfully building tabs outside of the main News Feed, like Marketplace for buying and selling items and Watch for videos. Even if only 10 to 20 percent of our community in the United States uses one of these tabs, that's around 15 million to 30 million people. We've been working with publishers on building an experience like this for news, and on Friday we launched the result of that work: Facebook News.
For the first time, there will be a place in the Facebook app dedicated solely to high-quality news. Because people are still better at picking out the most important and highest-quality stories, the top stories in Facebook News will be curated by a team of diverse and seasoned journalists. Below that, there will be a wider selection of stories that are personalized algorithmically. Each story will have clear branding and provenance from the news outlets that published them. Publishers have told us over the years that this is particularly important.
We've also built tools to help publishers increase their subscribers by driving people from Facebook links to publisher websites. Publishers are able to decide when a reader sees a paywall. They control the relationship with their readers with subscription payments taking place directly on publishers' websites. We don't take any cut of the subscription revenue because we want as much of the revenue as possible to go toward funding quality journalism.
This model establishes a long-term financial partnership between publishers and Facebook for the first time. We know that we need to help build a stable model. Unlike other things we've tried in the past, this is a multiyear commitment that should give publishers the confidence to plan ahead. We now have multiyear partnerships with ABC News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed, The Dallas Morning News and many more publishers.
This also establishes a new product on Facebook for people who want a dedicated high-quality news experience. This will start small, but I'm optimistic that if we listen carefully to the ideas and concerns of news organizations all over the world, we can grow this over time.
Supporting quality news can also help us fight misinformation. That's why we're setting strict standards for publishers to be eligible to appear in Facebook News. If a publisher posts misinformation, it will no longer appear in the product.
I believe deeply in the social good that journalism provides. Today, it's more important than ever: We need the news to scrutinize the powerful, reliably document major events and uncover new truths. This makes our society better, and I know from firsthand experience it has made our company better, too -- even when it's uncomfortable. I hope our efforts will honor the important work that journalists do and support the news industry that keeps us all informed.

Texto completo: Anonymous is set to rock the White House again - and he or she has the papers to back it up.
The nameless senior official's forthcoming tell-all book "A Warning" will reportedly include direct quotes from President Trump from meetings at the White House as well as notes and other documents bolstering its account of an off-the-rails commander-in-chief.
"You will hear a great deal from Donald Trump directly," the insider writes in a blurb included on the book's back cover. "There is no better witness to his character than his own words."
Axios reports the unnamed official regularly participated in meetings with Trump and has notes that will be included in the book, which hits shelves next month.
Long before the impeachment probe, Anonymous rattled Trump last year with a New York Times opinion piece detailing the extraordinary steps some Trump insiders take to protect the nation from his worst impulses.

Donald Trump’s gift to Mitt Romney: Relevance

Texto completo: Washington • “I don’t feel that there’s a need to be careful at this stage of my life,” said Sen. Mitt Romney, who seems intent on proving as much these days.
Romney, the freshman Republican from Utah — as opposed to the former governor of Massachusetts who ran twice for president — has discovered that hyper self-restraint might be overrated. Credit to Donald Trump for this lesson, a rare instance of something Romney might emulate about a president he otherwise has little use for.
“I would have been far less disciplined when I was running,” Romney said, meaning for president, in 2008 and 2012. If only he had the example of Trump’s campaign in 2016 to follow, an imprudent ramble that somehow landed this most unruly of characters in the White House.
If it’s possible to be both deeply troubled and having a blast at the same time, that is Romney in this strange iteration of his public life. In a sense, he has been gifted by Trump with a kind of late-career relevance that he might not have otherwise enjoyed.
It’s not a benefit he expected, or even asked for. Romney had to content himself at first with critiquing from the gallery of Republican elders: In a 2016 speech he said, “Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,” as Trump was in the process of rolling to the Republican nomination.
Since then, events have conspired to return Romney back into the dirty coliseum of politics. He reflected on this return while folded into an armchair of his Washington office during another screwy week in the capital. In the past few days the president had, among other things, declared the emoluments clause of the Constitution to be “phony,” compared the impeachment inquiry to a “lynching” and dismissed his Republican critics as “human scum.”
In the midst of all this, weighty decisions and debates were playing out all through the marbled chambers of Capitol Hill. “I do believe it’s an inflection point in history when a president is impeached,” Romney said. He has been a persistent critic of the president’s conduct, and therefore perhaps the highest-profile specimen of “human scum” in Trump, D.C. — a designation that seems not to trouble him at all.
Now 72, Romney looks every bit the well-barbered character who was the last presidential nominee of the pre-Trump Republican Party. He has now settled into a hybrid role of sober statesman and maverick in a party struggling to reconcile the oft-irreconcilable impulses of its leader.
This “Free Mitt” phase has been accompanied by goofy episodes. In an interview with the Atlantic’s McKay Coppins published last weekend, Romney introduced the concept of “Pierre Delecto” into our Crazytown lexicon by oversharing that he maintained a pseudonymous Twitter account — and thus moving another reporter (Ashley Feinberg of Slate) to discover that the Twitter user going by the name Pierre Delecto was in fact Romney.
Outside of Twitter, Romney has been consuming history, reading the Federalist Papers and boning up on how the founders imagined curbing the abuses of presidential power. “The history of civilizations is, some strong man — and typically it’s a man — getting a few people around them to oppress other people,” Romney said. He mentioned feudal lords and Aztec emperors and czars. Then the United States came along. “And instead of everything being circled around one person, the power will be with the people.”
On a top shelf across from Romney’s desk hangs a blown-up photo of an old Look magazine article about his late father, George Romney, a three-term governor of Michigan who also pursued the Republican presidential nomination. “Why the Republican Pros Distrust Him,” read the headline of the Look article. George Romney was an old-style moderate back when that species still existed in the Republican Party.
Romney idolized his father, to a point where he would write “dad” on a piece of paper and place it on his podium when he took to the debate stage. After George retired from public life, he spent years in the political wilderness, struggling to get meetings and platforms.
“I remember my dad becoming quite frustrated,” Romney recalled after he lost to Barack Obama in 2012. He expected a similar fate to what had befallen other presidential runners-up. In “Mitt,” the Netflix documentary about Romney’s presidential campaigns, he anticipated that his destiny would be to become a “loser for life.”
But Mitt Romney has operated in a seismically different media environment than his father ever did; chances for second and third and 12th acts spring ever-abundant.
At the urging of his wife, Ann, he decided to run in 2018 to replace the retiring Republican senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch. He had become a bit stir crazy. “I didn’t really go back into business very much,” he said. “Frankly the investment world had passed me by.” It could be frustrating to follow politics on TV. “Listening to some of the things being said, I would pull my hair out figuratively,” he said. “Though looking at it,” he added, patting his temples, “the line is going back, so literally as well.” (This was not convincing.)
Romney was a stand-alone political brand in his own right, but his willingness to discharge antipathy for Trump made him more than just a political comeback story. On the eve of being sworn into the Senate, Romney published an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he concluded that Trump had “not risen to the mantle of the office.” This was two years after then-President-elect Trump had engaged Romney about possibly serving as his secretary of state. Romney said he most likely would have taken the job if offered, but it was not — and just as well.
“The best personnel decision he made was not choosing me,” Romney said. “I would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson,” he added of the eventual choice “and maybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci did,” referring to the White House communications director who lasted less than two weeks in the job.
Romney’s criticisms of Trump have elicited predictable counterattacks, which of course amplifies the noise. The president has deemed Romney “a pompous ass,” a “fool” “so bad for R’s!” and — because what the heck — called for his impeachment.
“I think that Donald Trump thinks a lot more about Mitt Romney than Mitt Romney thinks about Donald Trump,” said Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant and chief strategist of Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. “Donald Trump is fundamentally an unhappy, angry person. Mitt Romney is fundamentally a happy not angry person.”
Romney says he’s not running for the big job again, despite periodic attempts urging him to re-re-re-consider the idea and to launch a Hail Mary primary challenge to Trump. He also sounds unbothered by Republicans who question his loyalty. “People say to me, ‘If you’re critical of the president you’re hurting the party,’” Romney said. “No I’m not — I’m laying out a path for the party post the president.”
He knows full well that one colossal decision might loom for him above all others. Impeachment votes tend to weigh heavily in legacy discussions. Larry Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, recalls the example of his late father, Lawrence Hogan, who served three terms in Congress from 1969 to 1975. He was a Republican in good standing and a supporter of President Richard Nixon. But he would always be remembered as the only Republican representative who, in a surprise, voted to recommend all three articles of impeachment against Nixon. He paid a big price, his son recalled.
“He lost friends in Congress, he lost the support of his constituents and he angered the White House,” Hogan said. People did not forgive him for decades. “But history was kind to him,” Hogan added. “He was known as a courageous guy. I think it’s the thing he is most remembered for, and the thing I’m most proud of him for.”
Romney said he finds himself asking what his father would do. “That was one of the cards Ann played,” he said, when she was trying to convince him to run for the Senate. Romney worried that after being the Republican nominee, the Senate would be a step down.
“But Ann said, ‘What would your dad do?’” Romney said. “You know, just because you weren’t made general doesn’t mean you stop fighting.”

Un funcionario de Trump pregunta al juez si tiene que testificar en la investigación del juicio político

Texto completo: Charles Kupperman , exasesor adjunto de seguridad nacional del presidente Donald Trump, presentó una demanda el viernes pidiendo a un juez federal que determine si debe testificar en la investigación de juicio político que lleva a cabo la Cámara de Representantes.
El resultado podría afectar la capacidad de otros testigos que trabajaron estrechamente con el presidente para cooperar con la investigación en curso. La demanda fue publicada por primera vez por The New York Times este viernes.
Kupperman está programado para testificar el lunes. La entrevista acercaría la investigación a la órbita de John Bolton, el exasesor de seguridad nacional de Trump.
Los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes están llevando a cabo una investigación de juicio político que se centra en la presunta presión sobre el presidente de Ucrania para que anuncie investigaciones sobre lo que se ha llamado una teoría de conspiración en las elecciones presidenciales de 2016, así como sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden y su hijo.
Los críticos dicen que eso equivale a un abuso de poder por parte del presidente para beneficio político personal. Kupperman alega en la demanda que los abogados de la Casa Blanca le dijeron que no compareciera el lunes.
La demanda añade que el abogado de la Casa Blanca informó al abogado de Kupperman que “para proteger las prerrogativas de la oficina del presidente hoy y en el futuro, y en respuesta a su solicitud, el presidente le ordena al Sr. Kupperman que no comparezca en el horario programado del Comité en la audiencia del lunes 28 de octubre de 2019 “.
Kupperman afirma en la demanda que no está seguro de si la citación emitida por la Cámara le obliga a comparecer y que “está obligado por su juramento a cumplir los mandatos constitucionales legales tanto del presidente como de la Cámara de Representantes”. “El demandante no puede satisfacer las órdenes de los Demandados de la Cámara de Representantes, por un lado, y del Presidente Trump, por el otro”, señala en el texto.
El viernes pasado, un juez federal determinó que la investigación de juicio político es válida, a pesar de los argumentos del presidente y sus aliados de que era necesario un voto pleno de la Cámara para comenzar el proceso.
“Incluso en casos de destitución presidencial nunca se ha requerido una resolución de la Cámara para comenzar una investigación de destitución”, escribió la jueza Beryl Howell, juez principal del tribunal de distrito de Washington, D.C.
La oficina del abogado de la Casa Blanca se ha negado a cooperar con la investigación, argumentando que es ilegítima porque la Cámara no celebró una votación formal para declararla.
Howell en el fallo del viernes también ordenó al Departamento de Justicia que entregue el material del gran jurado al que se hace referencia en partes redactadas del informe del abogado especial Robert Mueller al Comité Judicial de la Cámara. Se espera que el Departamento de Justicia apele.

Texto completo: Carl Safina, 64, an ecologist at Stony Brook University on Long Island and a MacArthur “genius” grant winner, has written nine books about the human connection to the animal world. Coming next spring is “Becoming Wild,” on the culture of animals, and a young adult version of “Beyond Words,” on the capabilities of dogs and wolves.
We spoke over lunch in his Long Island garden, surrounded by his three dogs, some wild squirrels and a group of extremely tame hens. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.
Q: When a writer for the Sierra Club’s magazine recently put the words “animal” and “cognition” into Google Scholar, he was directed to almost 200,000 citations published in the past five years. Why the explosion of interest in this scientific area?
A: I think it’s happened because in recent years we’ve come to know much more about the inner activity of nonhuman minds.
We have tools today that didn’t exist 50 or even 10 years ago. There are researchers putting dogs into MRIs, and so it’s become possible to watch their brains do things. What we’re learning is that animals do have felt experiences and thus, I think, consciousness.
Q: What’s your definition of consciousness?
A: To me, consciousness is the thing that feels like something. It’s the sensation of experiencing the input from your sense organs. We’re learning that a lot of animals - dogs, elephants, other primates - have it.
Q: How else has research on animal behavior improved?
A: Well, until the 1950s and the 1960s, the study of animal behavior wasn’t seen as real science. Until Jane Goodall, Iain Douglas-Hamilton and George Schaller began publishing, there were few studies. They were among the first to watch wild animals for the purpose of describing their behavior. Before, if you wanted to study elephants, you shot them and pulled their molars out to see how old they were.
Thanks to these pioneers, we’ve learned that wild animals do complicated things. Many recognize the individuals around them - even solitary animals, like mountain lions. There usually is a male mountain lion with a large territory who visits a few females inhabiting the territory. The females all know each other. The adjacent males know who their neighbors are.
Who knew that dolphins could recognize each other after a long separation? Yet, scientists report that there was a dolphin in an aquarium who hadn’t seen another captive dolphin in 20 years. When they were reunited, there was immediate recognition.
Frans de Waal’s latest book, “Mama’s Last Hug,” chronicles the emotional deathbed reunion of an aged zoo chimpanzee and primatologist Jan van Hooff, who had worked with her for many years. Though Mama is listless, when van Hooff approaches her after a long separation, she recognizes him and reaches out to touch him.
Chimpanzees, dolphins, elephants - they’ve all demonstrated signs of recognizing individuals. Videos show that their recognition is not mechanical, not a chemical match with a stored memory bank. It is often accompanied by shows of emotion, which proves to me that the experience is felt.
Q: Has the internet widened our understanding of the animal world?
A: I’d say so. Almost everyone nowadays has a video camera on them all the time, and animal behaviors get recorded that we haven’t seen before. The other day, someone sent me a video where someone was backing up their car and a puppy went behind it. Another dog came streaking out at high speed, snatching the puppy away.
Thanks to the ubiquity of these videos, we’re seeing evidence that the envelope of what animals can do is much bigger than we thought. That leads me to wonder: Why, despite increasing evidence, do some people deny that animals have emotions or feel pain?
Q: What’s your guess?
A: I think it’s because it’s easier to hurt them if you think of them as dumb brutes. Not long ago, I was on a boat with some nice people who spear swordfish for a living. They sneak up to swordfish sleeping near the surface of the water and harpoon them, and then the fish just go crazy and kind of explode. When I asked, “Do the fish feel pain?” the answer was, “They don’t feel anything.”
Now, it’s been proven experimentally that fish feel pain. I think they feel, at least, panic. They clearly are not having a good time when they are hooked. But if you think of yourself as a good person, you don’t want to believe you’re causing suffering. It’s easier to believe that there’s no pain.
Q: As a child, did you have pets?
A: I did. I spent my first 10 years in Brooklyn, where I had the kind of pets you’d buy in a store - a parakeet, little turtles.
From the time I was 7, I had homing pigeons. I learned about life, with a capital “L,” from them. The pigeons figured out who they were going to mate with. They’d be out flying around during the day and they’d come home, feed their babies and go to sleep. Watching them go about their lives, you saw them do a lot of the things that humans do. It was there right in front of your eyes.
Then, I went to college, and I learned that my childhood observations were not allowed. They were “anthropomorphic.” But the more I see of the new neuroscience and neurochemistry, I see a lot of overlap. All of life is literally kin. I first learned that from my Brooklyn pigeons.
Q: You live with three dogs. What have you learned from them?
A: Among things, that they are capable of anticipation. For instance, they show much excitement when I simply touch my car keys, which might well signal that they are going to some place interesting, like the beach. That proves that they have imagination and even memory.
Another thing - and this shouldn’t surprise - they can be quite emotional. Some years ago, I lived with someone with a dog. Before we broke up, we argued a lot. Once, we took her dog to the beach, and we started bickering there. That dog just basically collapsed into a pile of leaves and would not get up. She did not want to be with us. And we weren’t even yelling at her. She just did not want to be a part of an unhappy scene.
That showed me that they can have a real-time valuation of their experiences. They know what they prefer to avoid.
Q: The psychologist who puts dogs into MRIs, Dr. Gregory Berns, wrote a book in 2013 titled “How Dogs Love Us.” Do you think your dogs do?
A: That’s easy. Yes. And I don’t need to scan their brain activity to know this. They show it in their actions and the choices they make. Our dogs sleep on the floor in our bedroom just to be near us.
We’ve never given them any treats in that room. The only thing they get for the effort of climbing the stairs is proximity to us. At dawn, two of the three jump on the bed. Jude, the third, has a knee problem, and he can’t. When we wake up, it’s always all tongues and tails and “Oh happy day!”
During the day, they roam free in the house and the yard. If I’m writing or working outside, they’re never more than a hundred feet from me. That’s their choice.
My point is that they seek us out just to be near us. And what is love’s fundamental emotion? It’s the desire to be near loved ones. So yes, dogs can love their humans.

Texto completo: A theologian and an Anglican priest, he argued that traditional African religions deserved the same respect as Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.
John Mbiti, a prominent Christian theologian from Kenya who helped debunk entrenched ideas that traditional African religions were primitive, giving them equal weight with major world faiths, died on Oct. 5 at a nursing home in Burgdorf, Switzerland. He was 87.
His daughter Maria Mbiti confirmed the death but did not give the cause.
In his writings, Mr. Mbiti described a landscape of tribal and national religions in Africa that might have lacked sacred texts like the Bible but that nonetheless lived deeply in people's hearts and minds, in rituals and oral histories, and through priests, elders and kings.
"Everyone is a religious carrier," he wrote in his influential book "African Religions and Philosophy" (1969), a result of his field work in Africa.
"Wherever the African is," he added, "there is his religion."
He disputed characterizations of African religions as anti-Christian at best and practiced by savages at worst -- labels that had been used to justify imperialism and slavery.
African religions, he said, were as deeply rooted, and as legitimate, as Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism.
"The God described in the Bible is none other than the God who is already known in the framework of our traditional African religiosity," Mr. Mbiti wrote in The Christian Century magazine in 1980. "The missionaries who introduced the gospel to Africa in the past 200 years did not bring God to our continent. Instead, God brought them."
Jacob K. Olupona, a professor of African religious traditions at the Harvard Divinity School who helped edit a book of essays about Mr. Mbiti's legacy, said by phone: "He opened the field and got people talking about traditional African religions in a different context. For African scholars like me, he was the very model of scholarship."
Devaka Premawardhana, a professor of religion at Emory University in Atlanta, praised Mr. Mbiti for challenging perceptions of Africa as a continent without history, civilization or religion, and for "uncovering and undercutting the very foundations of Western supremacy."
But, he said, Mr. Mbiti was criticized, most famously by the Ugandan writer Okot p'Bitek, for casting his arguments in intellectual terms that had been established by the West. Mr. Mbiti insisted, for example, that African cosmologies ultimately align with Christian views of God as omnipotent, omnipresent and eternal.
"The African deities of the books, clothed with the attributes of the Christian God, are, in the main, creations of the students of African religions" like Mr. Mbiti, Mr. p'Bitek wrote in "African Religions in Western Scholarship" (1970). "They are all beyond recognition to the ordinary Africans in the countryside."
Mr. Mbiti never responded to the criticism, according to Derek Peterson, a professor of history and African Studies at the University of Michigan.
John Samuel Mbiti was born on Nov. 30, 1931, in Mulango, Kenya. His father, Mutuvi Ngaangi, and his mother, Valesi Mbandi, were farmers. Raised and schooled as a Christian, he accepted the prevailing view of traditional African religions as demonic.
After graduating from a high school near Nairobi, Mr. Mbiti studied English, sociology and geography at University College of Makerere in Kampala, Uganda, in 1953. He then received a bachelor's degree in theology from Barrington College, a Christian liberal arts school in Rhode Island.
After teaching briefly in Kenya and Britain, he earned a Ph.D. in theology at Cambridge University, where he met his future wife, Verena Siegenthaler. Around that time he was also ordained as an Anglican priest by the Church of England. He served as a parish priest in England for a while before returning to Makerere in 1964 as a teacher of traditional African religions.
His lack of knowledge about the subject led him to his field work, and to the publication of "African Religions and Philosophy."
Mr. Mbiti quickly became a leading African scholar of Christianity. When asked in 1971 about the growing influence of Africa on Christianity, he offered a pungent assessment.
"The days are over when we will be carbon copies of European Christians," he told The New York Times. "Europe and America westernized Christianity. The Orthodox easternized it. Now it's our turn to Africanize it."
He taught at Makerere until 1974, when he was hired as director of the influential World Council of Churches Bossey Ecumenical Institute, in Bogis-Bossey, Switzerland. While there, he became known for organizing conferences on intercultural theology.
The Rev. Dr. Olav Fykse Tveit, a Norwegian theologian who is the council's general secretary, said on its website that Mr. Mbiti would be remembered for his "sense of justice for indigenous peoples" and for bringing "African theology into global ecumenical theology."
He left the council in the early 1980s and became a parish minister in Burgdorf for 15 years. He also taught theology at the University of Bern from 1983 to 2003.
After Mr. Mbiti's death, President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya said: "We've lost a great Kenyan. He was a role model and an ambassador of the Kenyan brand abroad."
Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, wrote on Twitter, "Thanks be to God for the life, scholarship and witness of a key father of African theology."
In addition to his wife and his daughter Maria, Mr. Mbiti is survived by two other daughters, Esther and Kavata Mbiti; a son, Kyeni; five grandchildren; his sisters, Meliki Mbithe and Margret Mwangangi, and his brothers, Mailu Mutuvi and Lenah John.
In 2014, after several years of work, Mr. Mbiti completed his translation of the New Testament from the original Greek into his local language, Kamba. The project started as a hobby but became essential reading for schoolchildren and others in Kenya.
"When I compared the existing Kamba Bible version of the New Testament with the Greek text, I noted more than 1,000 mistakes," he told The Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, in 2015. "This prompted me to begin the work of correcting the gaps by translating the Bible into my mother tongue."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The rapper Cardi B posted on social media earlier this year about an inmate who died in a prison in upstate New York. She and the man's family suspected foul play.
I'm a reporter on The New York Times's Metro desk covering criminal courts and jails, so my editor asked me to look into it. The rapper's message was intriguing, and holding the criminal justice system accountable is central to what journalists do.
I reached out to a nonprofit that tracks abuses of inmates, but the executive director said she did not have much information about that inmate's death. She had, however, received a prison letter about another man who had died under questionable circumstances: John McMillon. I added it to a list of things to follow up on.
That afternoon, I read through a stack of prison mail sent to The Times, searching for information about the first inmate. (We receive multiple letters a week from inmates.) Again, I ran across Mr. McMillon's name: A fellow inmate wrote that Mr. McMillon had been the victim of a vicious beating by guards. Was it a coincidence?
Within hours, still seeking information about the first inmate, I phoned a civil rights lawyer, and he, too, mentioned Mr. McMillon's death, saying one of his clients had called to tell him he witnessed the assault.
Deaths in prison are notoriously difficult to investigate, and figuring out what happened comes down to an officer's word against an inmate's. But three reports from three separate sources was a strong lead, so I spent the next several months trying to determine what exactly happened to Mr. McMillon. The answer? It depended on whom I asked.
On Jan. 22, according to a state autopsy, Mr. McMillon suffered a heart attack and died after a struggle with guards that evening at the Great Meadow Correctional Facility. The correction officers said Mr. McMillon had lunged at them and was behaving erratically. A local district attorney said video footage supported the guards' account. But inmates said they saw a brutal beating by guards that left him bloodied and dead.
Mr. McMillon, 67, had schizophrenia and epilepsy, and had been previously disciplined for attacking a guard at another prison in 2017, state records show.
Great Meadow, where Mr. McMillon had been an inmate, is a maximum-security prison more than 200 miles north of New York City with a history of violence.
Nine inmates all said Mr. McMillon had been beaten, including four that I interviewed at Great Meadow and at another prison (though all were at Great Meadow at the time of the struggle). The others had spoken to prisoners' rights groups and state investigators, and their statements to each matched.
Inmates are typically cautious about speaking out about brutality because they often fear retaliation by guards. I interviewed the inmates separately over several weeks to avoid arousing suspicion, traveling nearly four hours upstate toward the Vermont border each time. (The guards did get suspicious, and I stopped after speaking to four inmates for fear of making them vulnerable to retribution.)
I showed up to prison for interviews as a visitor instead of making a formal request as a reporter, in which case I most likely would have been assigned an escort. Because I was visiting as a general member of the public, I could not bring a pen and pad with me. I repeated questions and asked inmates to repeat their answers so that I could memorize their responses. Afterward, I would rush to get out of the prison and to my car to quickly scribble down what they had told me.
I waited in visiting rooms with mothers and their children, and parents waiting to see incarcerated loved ones. Each time an inmate arrived, I would lean in and say who I was and why I was there. I immediately asked the inmates if they were comfortable speaking with me and how they felt about going on the record with their names. One of them, Pernell Griffin, said he was retaliated against after he spoke to investigators, but still insisted I use his name.
My first interview was with Ricardo Rosado, the inmate who had written to The Times. I asked him why he felt compelled to say anything at all.
"If it had happened to me," he said, "I would want someone to do the same thing."

Texto completo: Please read "Bureaucratic thriller laid out in hearing," an article on page 9A of Thursday's News-Press.
Consider that the witness, William Taylor, is a career diplomat with 30 years of experience. Taylor was appointed to his current position in Ukraine by the Trump-appointed secretary of state, Michael Pompeo. Taylor was educated at Harvard University and the U.S. Military Academy and he has an impeccable reputation among professionals who have worked with him.
After reading that article and the transcript of President Trump's famous telephone call with the new president of Ukraine, can you tell your children that Trump is an honest capable president who should not be impeached and removed from office?
If you're still in doubt, read Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, which includes evidence of 10 instances of obstruction of justice and 14 instances of collusion (conspiracy). A sitting president cannot be indicted for such instances (under current Justice Department policy), but they are impeachable offenses under "treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors" (terms in the Constitution).
Martin Harris, Cape Coral
What has Trump done for Americans? A recent letter writer thought President Trump has actually done something great for our country. How sad to read something like that, but such people are not unique to our country. We find them everywhere a dictator has been in power throughout the ages.
The masses come by the thousands to cheer one of their own as he rules over them with fake promises of all the great things he will do for them. Milk, honey and free walls are just down the road.
I wish just once a letter would tell what it is Trump has done for the writer personally. Quoting Fox mythology doesn't count, nor does the growth curve, which started in 2009.
Adding a trillion dollars annually to our national debt is not a benefit. Sure, it's nice for those who can add that money to their portfolios, but I believe the letters come from the lower-income spectrum. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Every one of us already owes our creditors around $76,000.
Trump has done great things to ruin America, just as he has done with most of his business ventures. He can fool enough people to make himself believable. Great con men have that ability and get away with it — for a while.
Fred Rump, Golden Gate Estates
Testimony on Ukraine discussions Regarding your editorial on Trump's weakening position, I would suggest when it comes to Gordon Sondland, Bill Taylor, Marie Youanovitch, Fiona Hill, George Kent and Michael McKinley, their bank accounts should be checked.
Why did their so-called testimony have to be in secret, far removed from the American public?
Field Retterer, Bonita Springs
Facebook and fact checking Mark Zuckerberg, in congressional committee testimony, said he was in favor of leaving it up to non-Facebook news sources ("mainstream media"?) to police the veracity of political ads (those paid for by politicians or their campaigns) on Facebook. He asserted that it is not up to Facebook to "fact-check" what politicians claim in their ads.
At the same time, they will continue to prohibit "hate speech" and "white supremacist" messages. Or to put it another way, they will prohibit no-cost expression but allow politicians to lie to their readers as long as the lies are paid for.
I feel both classes of speech are equally objectionable. But then, I dropped out of the University of Washington in the 1960s, not Harvard in the 2000s. Maybe the ethics courses changed.
Barry J. McCall, Bonita Springs
'Distorted perspective' of liberals Two letters published Oct. 21 in the News-Press illustrated the distorted perspective of many liberals.
One chastised a previous letter writer for apparently making comments without identifying a source. One has to wonder about the reaction to Hillary Clinton calling a Democratic presidential candidate a "Russian asset" without a shred of proof. The writer then referred to The New York Times and The Washington Post as credible sources, two of the most biased left-wing publications in the world.
The other letter bemoaned the effects of foreign influence in our elections. That did not exist until Trump was elected, according to the writer. Talk about twisted "facts." The Clintons attracted millions in foreign dollars that were laundered through their foundation. The DNC paid for the creation of the debunked Trump dossier that was based on Russian sources and was intended to swing the election to Hillary. Liberals are rarely concerned with credible sources or facts when making their points.

A Bold Plan for Zero-Emission Cars

Texto completo: I have a proposal that is supported not just by environmentalists but also by labor and large automakers.
Scientists tell us that to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change, the world needs to be carbon neutral -- to have net-zero carbon dioxide emissions -- by midcentury. At the moment, we are not remotely on track to meet that target. We need to act urgently and ambitiously, which will require building diverse coalitions of political support.
That's why I am announcing a new proposal designed to rapidly phase out gas-powered vehicles and replace them with zero-emission, or "clean," vehicles like electric cars. The goal of the plan, which also aims to spur a transformation in American manufacturing, is that by 2040 all vehicles on the road should be clean.
What distinguishes this proposal is not only its scale but also its ability to unite the American environmental movement, the American labor movement and large automakers. It has already earned the support of climate groups like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the League of Conservation Voters; labor unions like the United Automobile Workers and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; and car manufacturers like Ford and General Motors.
How would the plan work? First, it would give you a large discount on an American-made electric vehicle when you trade in a gas-powered car. Lower-income Americans could get an even bigger discount on a new vehicle or a discount on a used electric vehicle. In total, these discounts should result in 63 million fewer gas-powered cars on the road by 2030 and put America on a path to having 100 percent of new car sales be clean.
Second, the plan would make electric vehicles -- and the necessary battery-charging infrastructure -- accessible to all Americans, regardless of where they live and work. This would be accomplished by providing grants to states and cities to build charging stations, with a particular emphasis on low-income, rural and other underserved communities.
Third, the plan aims to establish the United States as the global leader in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing by providing grants to retool existing manufacturing plants in the United States and build new ones in this country that specialize in those technologies.
Accomplishing all of this would require an estimated investment of $ 454 billion over 10 years.
You might object: Isn't the transition to electric vehicles already happening? Yes, but it is progressing too slowly. Transportation still accounts for nearly one-third of America's carbon output. Even though many American automakers are preparing for an all-electric future, electric vehicles are still too expensive for too many Americans, and our country lacks sufficient battery-charging infrastructure.
Critics have long said that bold action on climate change would cost America money and jobs. This is not true. My plan is estimated to create tens of thousands of new, good-paying jobs in this country and should re-establish the United States as the world leader in auto manufacturing. Much as America experienced a revolution in auto manufacturing at the outset of the 20th century, America under this plan should experience a revolution in clean auto manufacturing at the beginning of this century.
But we have to move fast. China now accounts for more than half of the world's electric vehicle market; it overtook the United States as the world leader in 2015. If we don't match the level of China's commitment, we will miss an enormous opportunity.
I have promised that if Democrats win control of the Senate in November 2020, I, as majority leader, will introduce bold and far-reaching climate legislation. This proposal for clean cars would be a key element of that bill.
Achieving progress in Washington on any major issue requires a broad coalition to break through the partisan gridlock. The support that this clean car proposal has already garnered from the environmental movement, the labor movement and automakers means not only that it is more likely to win support from the public but also that it is more likely to become law. Having a clearly popular and beneficial proposal like this one as a key element of a larger climate plan will give Democrats a strong hand to play.
This proposal is about American jobs, American global economic leadership and protecting the planet. Nothing could be more worthy of pursuit.

Korea's black comedy about class

Texto completo: A study published last year showed that around half of the top reporters and editors at the New York Times and Wall Street Journal came from the nation’s most elite colleges and universities. This was no surprise to me. In the decade I’ve spent working in and around Washington, D.C., I’ve been surrounded by the American elite: Harvard and Yale graduates, people who attended boarding schools as adolescents, and the sons and daughters of wealthy professionals. I’ve often felt like an alien creature rubbing shoulders with these people. As a child of two immigrants, I’ve inherited a lot of my parents’ anxieties. Even today, I have a hard time spending money because I’m worried about not having it in the future.
But America’s elite carry their own forms of anxiety. Their lives often consist of endless jockeying for credentials and prestige. And because class status in America isn’t always transmitted through intergenerational osmosis, the rich are increasingly anxious for their children. This anxiety can be so extreme that the actress Felicity Huffman, who was caught trying to bribe someone to boost her daughter’s SAT scores, was willing to risk jail time to secure her daughter a place in the meritocratic elite.
The contrasting anxieties of the rich and the poor are the central theme of Parasite, the latest socially conscious black comedy from South Korean director Bong Joon-ho. Bong is the mind behind such dystopian movies as 2017’s Okja, an animal rights parable, and 2013’s Snowpiercer, a stylish sci-fi thriller about class war. He is, in this humble reviewer’s opinion, one of the best satirists working today.
The protagonists of Parasite are the Kims, a lower-class South Korean family that lives in a subbasement in a poor district in Seoul. Although they live in crushing poverty, the Kims are clever and resourceful — much more so than some of the local rich.
The Kims hatch a plan to outsmart the Parks, a wealthy family that lives in a picturesque modern home in an upscale neighborhood. One by one, the Kims deceive the Parks into hiring them for various lucrative jobs, never giving away that they’re all from the same family. The Kims’ son, Ki-woo, is brought on as an English tutor for the Parks’ daughter after touting his fancy college degree, which he has forged using photo-editing software. Before long, his sister, Ki-jeong, is hired as an art teacher for the Parks’ son, Da-song. His father soon nabs a job as a driver, while his mother becomes the Parks’ housekeeper.
The speed with which the Kims turn themselves into recipients of the Park family’s largess is comical — it had the audience in my theater beside themselves with laughter. But underneath Bong’s comedy is serious commentary about how the poor have to adapt to survive. The Kim family doesn’t have the credentials that South Korea’s upper class thrives on, so they invent them. The stakes are made explicit during a torrential downpour, when the Kims are nearly flooded out of their apartment while the Parks celebrate how the rain improved the weather for Da-song’s posh birthday party. In a society that obsesses over titles and resumes, the Kims’ choice is stark: either tell a few small fibs or live in a slum forever.
But if Parasite were only a tale about how the poor are clever while the rich are gullible, it wouldn’t be half the film that Bong has produced. Even as it depicts the Kims’ struggle to escape the slums, it shows the Parks living with the crushing anxieties of the rich. They must continually perform the rituals necessary to maintain themselves as respectable members of South Korea’s upper class. Da-song is an unruly child, and Mrs. Park spends her days worried to death about his future. It is only by playing on her anxiety that Ki-jeong is able to manipulate her way into a job.
Mr. Park, on the other hand, believes he must use the resources at his disposal to appease all of his children's whims. He indulges Da-song’s interest in Native Americans by buying him a teepee, bow and arrow, and headdress. When Da-song wants to spend the night camping in his teepee in the backyard, both parents resign themselves to an uncomfortable night watching over him from the living room. Simply saying “no” to their child’s desires, as poorer parents are accustomed to doing, seems to be out of the question. But the Parks’ preoccupation with their own family’s status blinds them to the plight of those who work under them. They are quick to fire staff, and Mr. Park continually refers to the bad smell he picks up from Koreans who ride the subway.
Bong’s film is careful to avoid neatly sorting his characters into heroes and villains. “All the characters in Parasite are in the gray zone,” he told one interviewer. “They’re all nice to some degree and bad to some degree. And I think that’s closer to reality.” This moral complexity is brought home in the film’s second half, which takes Parasite from a simple Marxist allegory to something much richer. As the Kims begin to taste power, we see them become increasingly antisocial and even violent. During a pivotal moment, they are presented with an opportunity to aid a fellow member of the working class. But with their newly obtained positions at the Park household, their generosity all but disappears. Far from fetishizing the poor, Bong’s film depicts them as just as human as anyone else.
Partisans on both the Left and the Right should see Parasite and think hard about the lessons it’s trying to impart. Too much of American satire is obsessed with criticizing or belittling individual personalities, pretending that we can solve entrenched social problems if only we hurl enough mean-spirited barbs at a particular politician or political party.
Bong, by contrast, understands that most problems are structural in nature. The real villain of Parasite is neither the Park nor the Kim family but the system that forces both into a vicious, zero-sum conflict. And when people have to fight one another, whether for a decent job or for admissions to an elite college, we shouldn’t be surprised when they start to fight dirty.

Texto completo: Bárbara Vale y su hijo Jason Vale, ex campeón de lucha libre, fueron arrestados ayer en Queens (NYC) por cargos de fraude por supuestamente vender el elixir de albaricoque en Internet como una cura para el cáncer.
La dama de 77 años y su hijo de 51 fueron arrestados por la federal Administración de Drogas y Alimentos (FDA) y las autoridades del Servicio Postal (USPS), en su casa en Queens.
El Departamento de Protección Ambiental (DEP) de la ciudad de Nueva York estuvo en escena debido a los barriles llenos de líquido encontrados en la casa.
Bárbara Vale apareció en la corte el miércoles por la tarde, donde fue liberada con una fianza de $100 mil dólares, informó NBC News.
Su hijo Jason fue llevado al hospital después del arresto por un problema médico no revelado y no compareció ante el tribunal. El juez lo contactó por teléfono y le informó las mismas condiciones de su fianza de $100 mil dólares.
Según una denuncia penal, desde al menos enero de 2013 el dúo madre-hijo “ha estado operando un negocio en línea a través de un portal llamado “Apricotsfromgod.info“, desde el cual los consumidores pueden comprar diversos productos”.
La queja continúa diciendo: “Uno de estos productos es la amigdalina, un glucósido que se encuentra en el núcleo o las semillas de la mayoría de las frutas y se conoce con frecuencia como “Laetrile” o “Vitamina B-17”. Mientras que algunas personas creen que Laetrile puede tratar y controlar el cáncer, la FDA no respalda esta afirmación”.
Según la denuncia, en 2002 Jason fue acusado de intentar engañar a la FDA y distribuir laetrile, entre otros cargos. Posteriormente fue condenado en 2003 y cumplió cinco años de prisión, según los fiscales.
En 2008 el diario New York Times describió a Jason como un sobreviviente de cáncer que atribuía su recuperación al poder de las semillas de albaricoque.

Texto completo: YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. - A bolt from the maybe-future struck the technology community in late September. A paper by Google computer scientists appeared on a NASA website, claiming that an innovative new machine called a quantum computer had demonstrated “quantum supremacy.”
According to the paper, the device, in three minutes, had performed a highly technical and specialized computation that would have taken a regular computer 10,000 years to work out. The achievement, if real, could presage a revolution in how we think, compute, guard our data and interrogate the most subtle aspects of nature.
In an email, John Preskill, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology who coined the term “quantum supremacy,” said the Google work was potentially “a truly impressive achievement in experimental physics.”
But then the paper disappeared, leaving tech enthusiasts grasping at air.
At the time, Google declined to comment, but many experts suspect an official announcement is imminent.
And so quantum computing, one of the jazziest and most mysterious concepts in modern science, struggles to come of age.
It’s been a century since scientists discovered that, on the most intimate scales, nature operates according to principles that boggle our poor ape brains. Randomness and uncertainty rule, causes are not guaranteed to be linked to effects, and an electron or other subatomic entity can be everywhere or nowhere, a wave or a particle, until someone measures it.
Most of modern technology, from transistors and lasers to the gadgets in our pockets, runs on this quantum weirdness.
Lately technophiles, politicians and journalists have been worrying out loud that China is pulling ahead in the effort to harness said weirdness for industry and power, better spying and better computing. Last year Congress passed, and President Donald Trump signed, the National Quantum Initiative Act, a plan to spend $1.2 billion to boost research into quantum technology and especially quantum computers.
By exploiting the properties of quantum weirdness, these computers could do gazillions of calculations simultaneously, enough to break currently unbreakable codes and to solve hitherto unsolvable mathematical puzzles. Google, IBM, Microsoft and other companies are now designing and building starter versions and even putting them online, where almost anyone can learn to put the quantum realm to work.
Ordinary computers store data and perform computations as a series of bits that are either 1 or 0. By contrast, a quantum computer uses qubits, which can be 1 and 0 at the same time, at least until they are measured, at which point their states become defined.
Eight bits make a byte; the active working memory of a typical smartphone might employ something like 2 gigabytes, or two times 8 billion bits. That’s a lot of information, but it pales in comparison to the information capacity of only a few dozen qubits.
Growing fast
Because each qubit represents two states at once, the total number of states doubles with each added qubit. One qubit is two possible numbers, two is four possible numbers, three is eight and so forth. It starts slow but gets huge fast.
“Imagine you had 100 perfect qubits,” said Dario Gil, the head of IBM’s research lab in Yorktown Heights, New York. “You would need to devote every atom of planet Earth to store bits to describe that state of that quantum computer. By the time you had 280 perfect qubits, you would need every atom in the universe to store all the zeros and ones.”
How this is accomplished is an engineer’s dream and nightmare. Recently, Gil offered a tour of IBM’s quantum operation. The trip started with an actual quantum computer, its innards exposed, on display in the lobby of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center. It looked a bit like a small, inverted Christmas tree: 3 feet high and 1 foot wide, a series of gold-colored platforms hanging one from another and adorned with chips, wires, mysterious capsules and gleaming, curled silver tubes.
Each quantum computation starts and ends with a string of ones and zeros - classical bits - at the top of this assembly. Those bits are then converted into pulses of microwaves and sent down through wires and pipes to a series of 50 small superconducting devices called “transmons” - the qubits - dangling at the bottom.
The microwave pulses transform the qubits, putting them into a state of uncertainty between one and zero. Subsequent microwave pulses manipulate them, adding or subtracting them from one another or putting pairs of them into a spooky condition called entanglement, in which what happens to one qubit affects measurements of the other.
At the end, the qubits interfere with one another, producing an output string of ones and zeros that is the answer, Gil said.
All of this happens in a fraction of a second, which is as long as you can keep nature from peeking at the qubits and spoiling things. Moreover, in practice, the qubits must be sheltered from the noisy nonquantum world, so the process transpires inside a dilution refrigerator - a big Thermos bottle - where the temperature of the chips at the bottom is kept at just above absolute zero, colder than outer space.
At the other end of a long curving corridor, sitting alone in its own room, was the real, working thing. Called IBM Q System One, it was encased in a 9-foot-wide cube of black glass and accessible only through 700-pound doors a half-inch thick, the better to seal in the cold and seal out the universe of noise and interference. “Q” is for quantum. Designed by an architectural firm to be as modern, intimidating and opaque as the future itself, this machine is the most beautiful computer its users will probably never see.
Starter versions
While System One went online in January, a set of starter computers called IBM Q Experience has been available online for the past three years; anyone can log on and write and run programs on them. To date, Gil said, some 130,000 people have used it, running 17 million experiments and publishing some 200 papers. And there were more quantum devices, behind other doors, operated by scientists trying to learn how to speak nature’s exotic subatomic language. “I’m convinced there are more quantum computers working here than the rest of the world combined, in this building,” Gil said.
Mathematicians are still debating what might be accomplished with all this quantum power when it finally grows up. Ordinary computers are good for solving “easy” problems - questions that can be answered in a reasonable amount of time, like navigating the rings of Saturn or predicting the path of a hurricane.
Then there are “hard” problems, whose solutions are difficult to find but, once identified, are easy to verify. Among them is the factoring of large numbers. Many modern encryption schemes, like the widely used RSA cryptographic algorithm, rely on the inability to factor such numbers in a reasonable amount of time.
In 1994 Peter Shor, then at Bell Labs and now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, devised an algorithm that a quantum computer (a still-hypothetical device at the time) could use to factor big numbers and thus break most cybersecurity codes now in common use.
In 2012, Preskill, the Caltech physicist, invented the term “quantum supremacy” to describe the potential of quantum computers to drastically outperform classical ones.
Gil maintained that the term “quantum supremacy” was misleading and rhetorical overkill: “The reality is, the future of computing will be a hybrid between classical computer of bits, AI systems and quantum computing coming together.”
He and his colleagues would rather that we not judge quantum computers by qubits at all. They prefer a new metric, “quantum volume,” which takes into account both the numbers of qubits and the amount of error correction.
Quantum volume is doubling every year, according to IBM, but nobody can say how far this doubling must go before things get interesting.
The ultimate goal of quantum supremacy would be to use qubits to crack encryption codes. But that will take awhile. Google’s Sycamore computer has all of 53 qubits to its name, as does a new IBM computer, installed online at the company’s Quantum Computation Center in Poughkeepsie, New York. System One, IBM’s black cube from tomorrow, only has 20 qubits.
In contrast, many hundreds of qubits or more may be required to store just one of the huge numbers used in current cryptographic codes. And each of those qubits will need to be protected by many hundreds more, to protect against errors introduced by outside noise and interference.
All told, it could take millions of qubits to break a code using Shor’s algorithm; patience is required. In the meantime, Preskill said, “it will be fun to play with them and learn what they can do.”

Bar Harbor hospital's ER is prescribing meds for opioid withdrawal, but it's not the only one

Texto completo: Mount Desert Island Hospital has become one of a growing number of hospitals in Maine that are making opioid withdrawal medication available to patients in their emergency rooms -- a move the hospital hopes will result in more people with opioid addictions in the area pursuing treatment.
The Bar Harbor hospital started stocking buprenorphine, also known by the brand name Subutex, in its ER this past summer. As of Monday, the hospital's emergency department had started three patients on medication-assisted treatment, according to MDI Hospital spokeswoman Oka Hutchins.
Dr. Nathan Donaldson, the hospital's emergency medical director, said the hospital decided to make the medication available after Mid Coast Hospital in Brunswick two years ago became the first hospital in Maine to prescribe buprenorphine -- which lessens the severity of withdrawal and is a long-term addiction treatment -- to patients who came into its ER.
"We want to be sure that we are doing everything that we can to combat this public health crisis," Donaldson said. "On-demand opioid treatment works. Hopefully, every ER in Maine will have this available eventually."
Last year, there were 354 drug-overdose deaths in Maine, with more than 68,000 deaths reported nationally.
The number of Maine emergency rooms offering opioid withdrawal medications has grown to 15 of the state's 33 ERs in the two years since Mid Coast Hospital became the first, said Gordon Smith, Gov. Janet Mills' director of opioid response.
Among those offering such treatment are Southern Maine Medical Center in Biddeford, Mercy Hospital and Maine Medical Center in Portland, MaineGeneral Medical Center in Augusta and St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor, Smith said. Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor, one of the largest hospitals in Maine, plans to start offering opioid withdrawal medication in its emergency room soon, he said.
The goal is to have all 33 offering such treatment by the end of the year, Smith said, but the challenge is making sure those patients have access to regular, long-term treatment after being seen in their local ER. Federal law generally limits each patient to 72 hours of opioid withdrawal medication through a hospital's emergency department. After that, Smith said, they have to receive treatment through a primary care provider or a certified substance use medical treatment program.
"I think it will improve our situation in Maine, in which people clearly will have more access to health care," Smith said.
The ripple effects of addiction have spread into the criminal justice system, child welfare services, the economy and schools, Smith said. And, he added, Maine averages one overdose death a day.
"That's like an awfully big airplane crashing in the state of Maine every year," he said.
Hospitals that offer withdrawal medication to opioid-dependent patients in their ERs are helping to fill a much-needed gap in opioid treatment, hospital officials said. Until recently, ERs across the country only treated the symptoms of withdrawal when a patient came in -- nausea or diarrhea, for example -- but not the underlying cause of the symptoms.
But a 2015 study out of Yale-New Haven Hospital found that addicted patients who were given withdrawal medication during an ER visit were twice as likely to be in treatment a month later than patients who were given just information on where to find it, The New York Times reported last year.
At MDI Hospital, when an ER patient is ready to pursue addiction treatment, MDI Hospital connects him or her with Downeast Treatment Center in Ellsworth and other area providers.
Becky Schnur, spokeswoman for Maine Hospital Association, said that the biggest hurdle opioid-addicted patients face is getting into outpatient treatment, which can be hard to come by in some areas of the state.
"Providing addiction medication in [hospital emergency rooms] is a good start," Schnur said. "Addiction medication in [an emergency room setting] is helpful and buys some time to make arrangements with addiction treatment providers, but is by no means the full answer."
Based upon the volume of ER patients at Mid Coast Hospital who have been prescribed Suboxone in the past two years, MDI Hospital anticipates "a low volume" of about 10 patients during the first year of its program, said Hutchins, the hospital's spokeswoman.

Warren, Sanders deny the costly deceptions of 'Medicare for All'

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren took a pounding in the recent Democratic debate for her lack of candor on "Medicare for All." Asked whether it would require the middle class to pay more in taxes, she was a study in wriggly evasion. But that was no surprise. The selling of Medicare for All depends on a large amount of deception.
The name itself is deeply misleading. The "for all" part may be accurate, but the "Medicare" part is not.
It would be hugely ambitious to take the existing program and expand it to include everyone, not just seniors. But Bernie Sanders' proposal, which Warren co-sponsored, is to Medicare what a tiger is to a house cat. They have obvious similarities, but it would be dangerous to confuse the two.
To begin with, their plan is extravagantly generous. In his vision, Sanders boasted in the debate: "Premiums are gone. Copayments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone." Medicare, by contrast, has those features, which serve to restrain not only federal spending on health care but all spending on health care. Medicare for All would also cover things that Medicare doesn't -- vision care, dental care, hearing aids and long-term care.
These are major changes that would greatly increase the cost of providing universal coverage. The government would have to start paying expenses that patients previously had to pay -- not only the patients who would gain coverage but also those already on Medicare.
Right now, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason Universitynoted, "40% of national dental care expenses are paid out of pocket," with Medicare paying almost none. Under Medicare for All, the government would cover them all.
The second consequence would be to stimulate consumption of medical care. If the cost of seeing a doctor, getting an X-ray or trying some mildly promising therapy is zero, the demand for such services will jump. That would lead to yet another effect: longer wait times for appointments -- because the immediate supply of doctors and dentists would remain the same.
A recent study by the Urban Institute and the Commonwealth Fund estimated that a single-payer program providing the same benefits as the Affordable Care Act would boost federal outlays by $1.52 trillion in 2020. But expanding benefits and eliminating premiums, copayments and deductibles, as Sanders and Warren propose, would carry a price tag of $2.8 trillion.
The sponsors claim their plan will lower overall health care costs. But the savings would not come without pain. Medicare reimburses hospitals for about 87% of the cost of the patients it covers -- a burden hospitals can bear because private insurance reimburses them for about 145% of the cost of its patients. A knee replacement covered by Medicare might bring in $17,000, while a private insurer would pay $37,000.
If Sanders and Warren have their way, though, private insurance will go the way of the passenger pigeon. So hospitals would face a sharp reduction in revenue -- as much as 16%, according to Stanford medical school economist Kevin Schulman. Some, and perhaps many, would get the equivalent of a do-not-resuscitate order.
The expected savings, however, would not offset the likely costs. "Increased consumption of health care, a result of more generous benefits and no out-of-pocket costs, is greater than the savings from lower provider payments and administrative costs," the Urban Institute/Commonwealth Fund study concluded.
Sanders, unlike Warren, has laid out tax increases to finance the expansion -- but not adequate ones. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan fiscal watchdog group, says his plan would cover less than half of the federal government's outlays. "That would leave a $14 trillion 'hole' to be filled," it says. Warren has yet to demonstrate that she can do even that much.
Medicare, of course, didn't abolish private insurance, as Warren and Sanders want to do. Making such a massive change is a recipe for disruption and turmoil. "We're talking about changing flows of money on just a huge scale," Princeton sociologist Paul Starr told The New York Times. "There's no precedent in American history that compares to this."
When criticized, the two act as though they offer the only way to achieve universal coverage. What they omit is that plenty of countries have gotten there without adopting a single-payer system.
Demanding "Medicare for All" may work well at a campaign event, advertising an uncompromising commitment to ensuring that everyone has medical insurance. But what makes a good slogan would make a bad policy.

Electric bike craze coming to Montana?

Texto completo: In the last years of the 19th century, a bicycling craze swept the United States. At that time horses remained the most common means of personal transportation. Automobiles were rare and unaffordable; more a plaything for the rich than a way of getting from one place to the next.
With a chain drive, inflatable tires and equally sized wheels, all technological improvements developed in the 1880s, the bicycle became the first affordable means of conveyance that didn't require feeding or cleaning up after.
"...the bicycle promises a splendid extension of personal power and freedom, scarcely inferior to what wings would give," gushed an 1896 article from the New York Times.
More than a century later, a new bicycling craze is sweeping the nation once again. Electric bicycles have arrived, carrying with them the potential to vastly expand the number of people who choose a bicycle as their primary means of transportation. Riders who have already converted to an e-bike frequently describe their experience in terms no less effusive than those of the New York Times.
"The most fun I ever had on a bike was on my uncle's Turbo DEVO," said Jason Rosales, speaking of one of his first encounters with a high-end electric mountain bike. "It's a blast when you don't have to struggle to go uphill. You're constantly going that fast – get your adrenaline going and your heart pumping the whole time, instead of just trying to get up the hill."
Rosales, who manages the Knicker Biker bike shop in Great Falls, still prefers his traditional mechanical bicycle for his daily commute.
"I like the exercise (of a muscle bike), and an e-bike takes it away," Rosales said.
But he's quick to endorse e-bikes as a perfect alternative for people who want to experience the pleasures of riding without being physically tested on every slope.
"There are older riders, and there are younger people who want to get around town without a lot of exercise," Rosales said. "And then there's the hard cores who don't want to slow down going up the hills or have to walk their bikes on the single tracks (trails) around Great Falls."
The basic concept of an electrically propelled bicycle is nearly as old as the bicycle itself. In 1895, Ohio inventor Ogden Bolton Jr. received a U.S. patent for an electric bicycle with no gears and a 10-volt battery attached to its frame. However, e-bikes did not become commercially practical until the development of high storage density batteries in the 1990s.
Generally speaking e-bikes, also referred to as "pedelecs," are bicycles equipped with a battery-powered motor that engages while pedaling, or in some cases through the use of a throttle. As classified in the United States, e-bikes are "pedal assist" only, meaning they can not be propelled exclusively by their battery.
Depending upon the jurisdiction in which it operates, the motor of an e-bike is required to automatically disengage once the bike attains a speed of either 20- or 28 miles-per-hour. Electrically powered vehicles that do not require pedaling, or which continue to supply power in excess of 28-mph are legally classified as either mopeds or motorcycles and are, by definition, prohibited from traveling on paths and trails where traditional mechanical bikes are commonly found.
The intent of an e-bike is not to blast cyclists down the road without any effort at all, but instead to make their cycling experiences easier and more enjoyable.
"I always emphasize that it's fun, fun, fun," Kern Lee said of his e-bike riding experience.
Lee has been an avid cyclist and mountain biker for decades, but as he aged into his mid-60s, Lee found that he couldn't attack the steep grades as aggressively as he had in the past, and that it took longer for his body to recover. The experience wasn't as enjoyable as it once had been.
Last May, Lee bought an e-bike after riding a friend's electric mountain bike. In just more than four months, he's already put more than 800 miles on it.
"They're making bikes now that are both nimble and capable," Lee said of high-quality mountain e-bikes. "I'm riding rough stuff, doing jumps. These bikes really perform."
At 67, Lee is more fit and has greater endurance than most people half his age. The pleasure he finds in e-biking is closely connected to the exercise he continues to obtain from riding them.
"My average rides before on a regular bike were 10 to 12 miles," Lee said. "I felt like I could ride about as fast as I have ever ridden, but I couldn't sustain it. If I went too hard for too long, I wasn't riding the next day. My body just couldn't recover that fast."
"Now, I'm out riding longer, and I'm riding faster," he continued. "My average ride now is around 25 miles, and the next day I wake up feeling good."
Production line e-bikes are typically equipped with hand controls that adjust the amount of mechanical assistance the battery delivers to the bike. Range is a factor of the battery's storage capacity, the amount of assistance the rider dials up and the terrain over which they are traveling.
A fully charged e-bike delivering maximum assistance over steep terrain may have a range of fewer than 20 miles. Riding across a flat course with minimal assistance, the same bike could travel more than 100 miles without fully discharging. If the battery dies completely, the bike remains rideable, but since e-bikes are typically 15- to 20 lbs. heavier than comparable muscle-powered bikes, the ride would be sluggish.
Kern Lee's wife, Beverly, was never as avid a cyclist as her husband. Around town, running errands, a leisurely ride down a paved bike path were the bike rides Bev was most comfortable in. But as time went by, Bev's traditional bike began spending more time in her garage and less time on the road.
"I just kind of quit riding," she said. "I kept thinking, I've got to get back into this because it's good exercise, but it wasn't fun. It wasn't something I wanted to do anymore."
Shortly after buying his own mountain e-bike, Kern Lee bought Bev a commuter style e-bike more appropriate for the type of riding she was accustomed to doing. Bev soon rediscovered her enthusiasm for biking.
"At first, I was a little nervous because I hadn't been riding for a long time," she said. "But then it was so easy, it's so care free. It makes you feel like a kid again. It's fun. It's not work."
Americans have been comparatively slow warming up to e-bikes; Montanans even more so.
According to the market analytics firm Mordor Intelligence, global production of e-bikes topped $17. 7 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to $18.7 billion by 2024. China is both the world's largest producer and the largest consumer of e-bikes, where 210 million are ridden daily. In European countries like Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, e-bikes now make up nearly a quarter of all bike sales. City planners applaud their growing popularity, heralding e-bikes as a zero-emissions transportation alternative that helps reduce traffic congestion. Six e-bikes will easily fit in a parking space designed to accommodate a single automobile.
Compare this to the United States where just 263,000 e-bikes were sold in 2017, with only 48,000 of those (18 percent) manufactured domestically. While American interest in e-bikes may be lagging, it's growing rapidly.
E-bike sales in the U.S. increased 83 percent between May 2017 and May 2018, with e-bikes making up 10 percent of all bike sales for that period. Most major U.S. bicycle brands now sell e-bikes, with manufacturers positioning themselves to capitalize on the growing market.
Knicker Biker has been selling e-bikes at its Great Falls store for a little more than three years, and according to Rosales, both inquiries and sales have grown rapidly in the past year.
"I don't see it as a fad at all," he said of the future of e-bikes. "I think Great Falls is slow to catch up with other markets. I know for a fact it's far bigger in other areas, even close by like Missoula and Bozeman."
Perhaps the greatest deterrent to increased e-bike sales is their cost. Low end e-bikes start at around $1,400, while a specialized performance model can run as high as $14,000. E-bike advocates note that the high cost of an e-bike can be justified if the buyer is willing to replace short trips typically made by a car, thus realizing reduced costs in fuel and maintenance.
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, half of all driving trips in the United States are less than three miles in length, a distance easily covered by e-bikes. Students at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science found that on average e-bike owners replaced 46 percent of their car commutes and 30 percent of their driving errands with e-bike rides.
However, e-bikes are not without their critics. The most common source of concern focuses upon the potential safety risks of introducing a vehicle capable of a sustained speed of 28-mph onto paths and bike lanes already crowded with pedestrians, motorists and other cyclists.
In October 2017, the New York City Mayor's Office issued a news release boastfully announcing how the city had more than doubled the number of e-bikes it had seized over the preceding year.
"E-bikes are illegal to operate on New York City streets," the release states. "According to the City Administrative Code, an 'e-bike' constitutes a 'motorized scooter' and 'no person shall operate a motorized scooter in the City of New York. So far this year the NYPD (New York Police Department) has seized 923 e-bikes compared to the 341 it confiscated this time last year."
New York's crack down on e-bikes was short lived. It came in response to a sharp increase in the number of restaurants using e-bikes to make food deliveries in the crowded urban center. Fast and virtually silent, e-bikes were identified as the source of a sudden rise in pedestrian versus cyclist crashes.
"Electric bikes are dangerous nuisances in my Senate district for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers," New York State Senator Brad Holyman asserted. "Moreover, they're illegal, so it's outrageous that some irresponsible businesses in Manhattan brazenly flout the law by using e-bikes to make deliveries."
Delivery riders took to New York's streets to oppose the e-bike ban, arguing that city was unfairly impeding their ability to make a living. The impasse was resolved less than a year later when state lawmakers amended New York law to permit throttle-trolled bikes with a top speed of 25 mph.
A similar dispute has recently played out in the nation's national parks. Until a few weeks ago, the National Park Service was inconsistent on whether e-bikes were permitted on established bike paths. Some parks prohibited their use, classifying e-bikes as motorized vehicles. Others did not differentiate between path use by traditional muscle-powered bicycles and e-bikes.
In August 2019, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt issued a directive compelling all national parks to give greater access to e-bikes on trails designated for traditional muscle-powered bike use. The move prompted the following response from one cyclist writing to National Parks Traveler digital magazine.
"Mixed use bicycle and pedestrian paths are dangerous enough without adding any propelling device," the respondent wrote. "Changes as suggested will open rental companies to pressing the limits of the motors and throttling. The simplest and safest solution is to maintain these paths as non-mechanical only. At Yosemite I was required to walk from the parking lot on mixed use paths. While I was trying to dodge groups of pedestrians who covered the width of walkways, the bicycles created a definite hazard."
Jeff Mow, superintendent of Glacier National Park, recently told the Great Falls Tribune that there are only a handful of trails in Glacier that currently allow bikes of any type, and so the prospect of negative e-bike/pedestrian interactions is limited. Mow did say, however, that there are concerns about the safety of inexperienced cyclists overestimating their skills on Glacier's roads, particularly in the Spring when Going-to-the-Sun Road is opened to cyclists before motorized traffic is allowed.
"The roads haven't been cleared of rocks necessarily, so your dodging them," Mow said of the park's spring biking experience. "In some places the guard rails for cars haven't' been put up. It's not necessarily a place for the inexperienced."
"We already have these issues with traditional bikers - with people maybe not stopping to think, 'Am I really prepared for what is up ahead," he continued. "We will continue to address these issues in the future."
While the growing popularity of e-bikes may present some regulatory challenges, they are a mode of transportation with the potential to change how Americans commute and recreate. The "splendid extension of personal power and freedom" promised by mechanical bicycles more than 100 years ago could ultimately be realized by electric bikes in the 21st century.

Texto completo: Fans of Leigh Bardugo's young adult work will recognize her artistic prose, cutting and witty characters and dark fantasy world building in her first adult novel, "Ninth House" (Flatiron, 480 pp., ).
Bardugo is an acclaimed fantasy novelist, whose YA work "Shadow and Bone" is being adapted into a highly anticipated Netflix series. Those not familiar with Bardugo, or even YA literature, still will be delighted by this dark novel.
Set on the campus of Yale, "Ninth House" imagines that the school's secret societies are no longer just boys clubs but groups that create dark magic to manipulate stock markets and The New York Times bestseller list, see into the future and more. Alex Stern is a freshman when she enters Yale's dangerous Lethe House, one of nine secret societies that practice magic; it polices the other houses on campus.
Alex is not another privileged student from a wealthy or even middle-class family. In fact, Alex would have never entered Lethe House or even stepped into the Ivy League world if not for the fact that she can see ghosts, or "Greys," as they are called. If anything, Alex would have been another victim of the opioid epidemic if the members of Lethe had never found her in the hospital and invited her to Yale.
She is mentored by Darlington, a upperclassman who trains Alex in the dark arts until he mysteriously disappears at the end of her first semester. If that wasn't bad enough, just as the spring semester starts, a young lower-income woman from New Haven, Connecticut, is discovered dead on campus. As part of Lethe House, Alex must investigate whether the murder and disappearance of Darlington have anything to do with the magic that lurks on campus.
"Ninth House" is as much a fantasy murder-mystery as it is an exploration of white privilege, corruption, misogyny and trauma. Bardugo highlights the vast gap between the lower-income neighborhoods that surround the campus and the toxic wealth hoarding of the school's most privileged students. New Haven itself is a character in the novel, one that never willingly bends to magic or wealth even as it drastically changes through gentrification.
The novel alternates between Alex's and Darlington's perspectives from the first semester to the second in Alex's first year. As Alex sees the opportunity of a safe, more stable life for herself, she might have to trade it all for the truth.
"Ninth House" sometimes loses its characters' voices in the dense plot. The theme of privilege is so interwoven throughout the story that the book challenges readers to examine their own environment without being overtly on the nose.
It helps that Alex is a straight-shooting, instinct-driven character who understands the game she is in more than the gamemakers themselves.

Texto completo: Readers discuss a diplomat's account of the Trump administration's dealings with Ukraine.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Tied Aid to Inquiries, Envoy Says" (front page, Oct. 23):
Great moments in human history are better than the best fiction, and they often turn on the contributions of unexpected participants.
The contribution of one Vasily Arkhipov to the future of humanity may never be equaled. He was a senior officer on a Soviet sub during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and refused to assent to Capt. Valentin Savitsky's desire to launch a nuclear weapon, which could have ignited global thermonuclear war. (Though this was not known to us for decades, there ought to be statues of him throughout the world.)
Tuesday was another one of those moments for a lesser-known figure to have an indelible impact.
William Taylor -- the top American diplomat in Ukraine and the very model of a lifelong, bipartisan public servant of the highest character -- presented detailed testimony that is a searing indictment of the president of the United States. Now, no member of Congress can reasonably argue that there are no grounds for impeachment and removal from office.
Mark Keller
Portland, Ore.
To the Editor:
The improper pressure on the Ukrainian government and on William Taylor was intended in part to discredit the Russia investigation done by the American intelligence agencies, and thereby to reproach and threaten those who would dare to investigate President Trump. The professionals of the State Department have pushed back against this pressure, forcefully.
The Justice Department has not done so well. Attorney General William Barr's far-ranging "investigation" of the Russia investigation, intended to intimidate intelligence professionals as well as to bolster a false conspiracy theory for the Trump campaign, has proceeded without much visible resistance.
John Durham, a consummate professional who was put in nominal charge of the investigation to give it credibility, must by this time have figured out that he is being rolled, but so far he seems to have remained silent, while Mr. Barr and Mr. Trump invoke his name and spread their implicit threats across the globe.
One hopes that Mr. Durham and others in the Justice Department will speak out with as much force and courage as people in the State Department have shown.
Jim Robinson
Cincinnati
To the Editor:
William Taylor's congressional testimony confirmed that a "deep state" indeed exists, working against America's interests. We learned the names of the players. You report that Mr. Taylor testified about his growing realization that Mr. Trump had put in place "two channels of U.S. policymaking and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular," with the last group made up of Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, Rudolph Giuliani and Rick Perry.
And leading that group's disruptive, deep state activities is the nation's president, Donald Trump himself.

Bringing a Focus on Doing Good, and Not Only Doing Well

Texto completo: This article is part of a new series on Visionaries . The New York Times selected people from all over the world who are pushing the boundaries of their fields, from science and technology to culture and sports.
Sometimes it's better not to know the obstacles that exist when creating something new.
That was certainly true for Andrew Kassoy, who, along with Jay Coen Gilbert and Bart Houlahan, two friends and roommates from Stanford University, wanted to encourage companies to focus on their employees and the environment. In 2006, they left their jobs and created B Lab, which certifies companies that operate for social good, in addition to trying to make money. Think Fair Trade for food or LEED certification for environmentally sustainable buildings.
Certified companies -- referred to as B Corps -- are businesses with verified social and environmental performances, including factors such as sustainability, income inequality and the impact on local communities. They are, essentially, companies that use business as a force of good, rather than focusing solely on profit maximization. Companies like Patagonia, Eileen Fisher and Danone North America have all been certified; over all, there are more than 3,000 certified B Corps in 71 countries, Mr. Kassoy said.
Mr. Kassoy and his friends had not anticipated that the success of their efforts would also hinge on convincing individual state legislatures, as well as foreign countries, to amend their corporate laws. But through legwork, persistence and the help of some dedicated outside lawyers, the three slowly effected legal change in 37 states, including in Delaware, where more than two-thirds of the Fortune 500 and 80 percent of public companies are incorporated, according to state statistics.
Mr. Kassoy's work presaged a theme that in the last year has been adopted by business leaders like Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock, Inc., as well as the chief executives of the Business Roundtable, who are urging corporate accountability in areas like the treatment of employees and the impact on the environment, in addition to shareholder returns.
Mr. Kassoy -- who emphasized that B Lab was created by, and is still run by, all three men equally -- discussed how the organization continues to work to transform global capital markets.
The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
What would you like people to know about your work?
We started B Lab because we thought there had to be a better way of running the economy. Capitalism, historically, is about enterprise and the capital needed to grow that enterprise. What we're trying to do is create an economy where capital and enterprise meet not just to benefit a few shareholders, but to benefit society as a whole. Our goal is to have every company create value for all stakeholders -- like corporate workers and community members -- not just shareholders.
"I assumed the best way make a difference was to run for office."
What did you want to be when you were young?
By the time I was in fourth or fifth grade, I wanted to be an elected official or a policymaker. My grandfather Ruby, whom I was close to, read The New York Times every day from front to back and engaged me in conversation about policy and social justice from an early age. I assumed the best way make a difference was to run for office.
Who or what inspired you to go into your field?
A series of relationships and mentors have helped guide me, including my parents and my grandparents. I spent time in college working on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the elder Basil Brave Heart was a spiritual and moral center.
But it was former Congressman David Skaggs who really set me on my path. After I interned in his office, I asked if I could return to work for him after college. He said, "Maybe, but I think not yet." Instead, he told me to do something out in the world -- to see what our economy is all about. Although I had no experience in capital markets at the time, his words set me on that path and away from public policy. And I saw that I could effect change without being a politician.
Where do you find sources of creativity?
This is not a creative field -- it's not tech, art or music, but I do think that it requires a lot of creativity to invent what an economy ought to look like. But I'm not a mad genius imagining things and willing them to be true.
Instead, I find that creativity comes through relationships and community, and through conversation to find the right design.
What obstacles do you need to overcome?
We face an enormous challenge in that the economic system, over the last 400 years, was built on extraction, without limits. People have been treated as just another economic input, rather than as humans.
Jay and Bart had the experience of building a business that cared about their employees, while I was on Wall Street in private equity in the belly of the beast. I loved the work, but I saw the industry transformed to focus on how quickly you could leverage something up and sell it with very little interest on the underlying business or the humans involved. As the three of us talked about the problems we saw, we thought that there had to be a better way of running capitalism to benefit society and not just a few shareholders.
"What we're trying to do is create an economy where capital and enterprise meet not just to benefit a few shareholders, but to benefit society as a whole."
How do you define success?
As I rose up in private equity, the financial rewards never felt like success. And in the end that made it hard to stay in the field.
Instead, in my work at B Lab, success is any sign of progress toward an inclusive and regenerative economy that is both meaningful and long-lasting. And 13 years into our work, there are real signs of success: New laws that enable businesses to operate as if people and the planet mattered as much as profit, and moves by groups like the Business Roundtable in August. But we still need to tell corporate leaders that they need to walk the walk for change.
In my personal life, success is defined mostly by whether I have relationships that are bringing me -- and other people -- joy.
What challenges do you face?
We still need to address shareholder primacy as a mind-set and a legal impediment. And we are asking governments what else they can do and trying to form a broader coalition of organizations to address this. And we are working with multinational companies to encourage more to become B Corps -- they have big bullhorns and are really important to our work.
And we are also mindful that while we are trying to build a more inclusive economy, that to do so means we need a more inclusive community in business. It's a shift that will take some time, but it's one in which we need to play a role.
"I'm not a mad genius imagining things and willing them to be true."
How does technology interact with your profession?
Technology is having an enormous impact on business. Whether it's automation, outsourcing or the growth of the gig economy, or issues like privacy and the ownership of data, technology is dramatically changing the nature of work. And these are issues to think about if business is to have a positive impact on our economy.
At B Lab, we're dealing with the impact of technology in our standards, which we revise every three years. Recently, we've changed our definitions as they related to the people who support a company. We used to call them employees, but now we refer to them as workers because large percentages aren't actually employed by the company. By just asking about employees, we're missing a large percentage of the work force, including contractors and those working in the supply chain. We need to make sure to ask about those who may be on the margins -- the vulnerable workers in the economy.

Texto completo: Readers discuss whether Senator Warren should be more willing to compromise on her "Medicare for all" stand. Also: President Trump dismisses the Constitution; humility in its guises.
To the Editor:
Re "Can Warren Escape the Medicare Trap?" (column, Oct. 22):
Paul Krugman is right that Elizabeth Warren may have painted herself into a corner on the issue of "Medicare for all." But it is not too late to escape that "health policy trap."
I believed, like many of my fellow Democrats, that Ms. Warren was too far to the left to beat Donald Trump. Joe Biden looked like the "safe harbor" in the crowded Democratic field. That dynamic has changed. Mr. Biden hasn't done especially well so far, and Ms. Warren's relentless and well-articulated emphasis on substantive issues has been more and more convincing.
As Mr. Trump continues to implode, her ability to defeat him now seems plausible. She must, however, confront the reality that her insistence on eliminating private health insurance simply won't sell. What she should do is something Mr. Trump could never conceive of -- concede that she has listened to the mounting tide of public opinion and is willing to modify her position (a public option available to all?).
I believe that the public will applaud a candidate who actually listens to it and acts accordingly.

To the Editor:
Paul Krugman is right that a single option version of "Medicare for all" that abolishes existing private health care plans would be politically hazardous. Many of the more than half of the population that is covered by some kind of private health insurance will reflexively not like being told that they will be forced to drop their coverage. Remember how much blowback President Barack Obama received when the media reported that his vow that "if you like your health care plan, you can keep it" was not actually true.
Just imagine how many will feel if they are told that they won't be permitted to keep their health insurance coverage even if they like it. If Senator Elizabeth Warren is indeed so worried about protecting her left flank from Senator Bernie Sanders that she won't support a less absolutist "public option" plan, then the Democratic Party should choose a different candidate.

To the Editor:
Re "Warren Vows to Unveil Single-Payer Specifics" (news article, Oct. 21) and "Favoring Medicare for All, and the Taxes to Pay for It" (news article, Oct. 19):
The media have done a disservice by focusing on raising of taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system rather than focusing on total costs. Currently people pay large sums for health insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles and prescription drugs. Worse, under the present system, it is estimated that about 30 percent of health care costs are for administration, which is double the percentage in Canada.
Under Medicare for all, premiums, co-pays and deductibles would be eliminated. Additionally, the federal government would be able to negotiate drug prices, leading to substantial cost reductions. Taxes will go up, but overall costs to everyone except the very wealthy will go down with a single-payer system. That is, nearly all health care costs will be included in taxes, with minimal other costs for health care.

'Phony Emoluments Clause'
To the Editor:
Re "President Defends the Choice of His Own Resort to Host a Global Summit" (news article, Oct. 22):
President Trump's criticism of the "phony emoluments clause" is a new addition to his anti-democratic political lexicon. Besides "fake news," the country now has fake constitutional norms.
This is the autocrat's logic: Facts and institutional norms are determined by his arbitrary discretion and personal interests.

On Cultivating Humility
To the Editor:
Re "Humility Is Something to Boast About" (Science Times, Oct. 22):
How heartening to read that humility (like its cousin, emotional intelligence) is finally getting its due in research and psychological circles. Now if only our broader culture could appreciate this life-defining trait for the source of inspiration, strength, curiosity and meaning that it is.
Sadly, humility is often seen as a weakness, something to be exploited or ignored. Au contraire; humility, which nurtures its trusty companion self-knowledge, is the great sustainer and challenges one to constantly evolve.
I am not a scientist, but I "humbly" propose that humility is shaped early in one's life, especially by being exposed to greatness that makes one feel small: a walk along the mighty ocean, exploring the works of great literary or artistic masters, spiritual enlightenment, but most of all to be profoundly influenced by a role model who demonstrates compassion, empathy and kindness.

Facebook will pay some publishers for 'News' tab items

Texto completo: Facebook plans to launch a "News" tab on Friday that will offer stories from hundreds of news organizations, some of which will be paid fees for supplying content to the service, people familiar with the plan say.
The move, which will put the social media giant squarely back into the news-delivery business after having de-emphasized it last year, is seen within the news industry as a step toward the long-sought goal of having technology companies pay for the content they deliver to users. The News tab will also put Facebook into direct competition with the news aggregation services offered by Silicon Valley rivals Google and Apple.
Facebook's service will include some human curation by a small editorial team of journalists, who will select top stories. But mostly the News tab will rely on computerized algorithms that seek to match user interests with offerings from a wide range of reports on politics, sports, technology, entertainment and other subjects.
Facebook was a leading distributor of news ahead of an overhaul in January 2018, when it altered its algorithm to direct more "meaningful" posts from family members and friends into users' News Feeds after controversy about the prevalence of false and misleading news reports and allegations that Facebook favored liberal points of view. This retreat hurt the traffic of many publishers, and Facebook's move this week may help restore some of that audience - though not in News Feeds but in a separate News tab users can choose to click or ignore.
The list of participating news organizations - initially totaling about 200 - will include The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, Business Insider, BuzzFeed News and many local news sources, people familiar with the developing plans say. These people say the New York Times is likely to participate as well, though the terms have not been finalized. (The company declined to comment.)
Facebook also plans to offer local news sources from the nation's 10 largest markets and, eventually, a digest of local reports within the News tab, said a person familiar with the company's plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to divulge details not yet public.
Facebook declined to say which news organizations will participate or the timing of the service's launch but acknowledged the plans in broad terms. Facebook has a scheduled event in New York on Friday featuring chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp., parent company of the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. An invitation for the event promises "a first look at Facebook News."
"Working with the news industry to get Facebook's News tab right is our goal and focus this year. We are getting tremendous partner feedback on the product, and looking forward to launching this very soon," said Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president for global news partnerships and a former CNN journalist.
Though some within the industry worry that Facebook's offering will have an uneven impact on news organizations - with the largest and most prosperous benefiting the most - the willingness to pay at least some participants has been praised by news executives eager to generate more revenue when their stories are featured by technology companies.
News executives have long complained that technology platforms have usurped their major revenue streams, such as classified and display advertising, while building the popularity of their brands on the work of professional journalists at traditional news organizations. Dozens of such news organizations have folded over the past decade and many others have grappled with steeply falling revenue, shrinking staffs and declining readership as Facebook, Google, Apple and others have emerged as some of the most profitable companies in the world.
Direct payments by Facebook, which several dozen news organizations are expected to receive, will range from the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. But others will gain only the ability to generate revenue from advertising when Facebook features their stories - along with a potential for more exposure, people familiar with Facebook's plans say.
"We've got to have this for the whole news ecosystem," said David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, representing nearly 2,000 U.S.-based news organizations. "So while it's a start, and a good start, it's not a comprehensive solution."
Facebook joins a small but growing Silicon Valley trend in agreeing to pay for news, most visibly Apple with its Apple News+ subscription service, which for $9.99 a month offers a magazine-heavy mix of news sources that includes the Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times. But several other major news organizations, including The Post and the Times, declined to join amid complaints that it offered little opportunity for publishers to generate meaningful revenue or attract new paying subscribers. (Apple also runs another service, Apple News, that is free to users and has a wide range of sources.)
"Virtually every major platform - with the notable exception of Google - is working seriously on how to compensate news publishers," said Ben Smith, editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, who declined to confirm whether his news organization was participating in the Facebook program.
In addition to the Wall Street Journal, the Facebook News tab will feature other properties of parent company Dow Jones, such as Barron's, MarketWatch and Financial News. Facebook users will still need to have subscriptions to read much of the content of the Journal , which has one of the industry's strictest paywalls.
The Facebook News tab will respect such paywall policies, including at The Post where all users can access some stories but extensive reading generally requires a subscription. Facebook users who click on stories that are available only to subscribers - or who run through their allotted total of free ones - will be invited to sign up for subscriptions.
Washington Post spokeswoman Kris Coratti said Tuesday that The Post would join the Facebook News service.
The Post's former deputy national editor, Anne Kornblut, is overseeing the team of journalists who will choose top stories for the "News" tab, according to people familiar with planning for the service. She joined Facebook in 2015.
Many news organizations, including The Post, already share content extensively on Facebook through accounts they control, generating readership that can be monetized through advertising.
A previous effort by Facebook to highlight news links that human editors selected, through a section called "trending," sparked allegations that the editors suppressed stories featuring conservative points of view. Though the claims were not proved, Facebook later shut down the "trending" section.
Facebook's latest investment in news comes at a time when the company is facing rising political and regulatory pressure from federal and state officials, as well as complaints that it has not done enough to combat the disinformation that spread widely on the platform in the 2016 presidential election and beyond.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonce's anthemic hit "Brown Skin Girl" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.
"I was thinking about (the Harlem School of Arts) and what it does for children and its students (and) I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya. And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests," she said Monday night at the school's annual Mask Ball in New York City. "And my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit."
The Oscar winner's mother, Dorothy, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter.
"I really didn't do much," Dorothy Nyong'o said to laughs from the audience. Dorothy Nyong'o said she noticed her daughter's interest in the arts as a child and so she looked "for opportunities to nurture that."
"My job was really to facilitate it, and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want," she said.
Dorothy Nyong'o won over the audience with more sweet words for her daughter, who has appeared in films such as "Black Panther," "Star Wars," "Us" and "12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar.
"I'm proud of her. She makes me shine."
Lupita Nyong'o, 36, thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager, her mother "drove to rehearsals after a long day at work" and sat "in the car for five or so hours and she never complained."

Minaj - who has dated Kenneth Petty for about a year - seems to confirm her marriage with a video on Instagram that shows off Mr. and Mrs. coffee mugs and bride and groom hats. She also changed her Twitter name to Mrs. Petty. The couple first dated as teenagers and reunited last year.
Book him: Former acting solicitor general of the U.S. and MSNBC commentator Neal Katyal has written "Impeach: The Case Against Donald Trump." The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, comes out Nov. 26. Last month, Katyal wrote a New York Times op-ed piece in which he condemned Trump's "brazen conduct" and said impeachment was warranted even if he didn't commit an actual crime.
Snoop Dogg-endorsed: An Israeli start-up that promotes home-grown marijuana says it has signed on rapper Snoop Dogg as a brand ambassador. Snoop, an outspoken advocate of marijuana use, will promote Seedo's small refrigeratorlike machine that grows plants with the help of artificial intelligence. Snoop said that promoting a product that enables people to grow plants in unused urban spaces "is something I'm all the way down with."

Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election — that’s a fact, not a conspiracy theory

Texto completo: In their push for impeachment over what would otherwise have been a ridiculous issue, House Democrats, along with their friends in the national media, are about to jog the public’s memory on something most of us forgot three years ago: Ukraine directly interfered in our last presidential race for the benefit of one candidate over another. It just so happens that the candidate who benefited didn’t end up winning.
In August 2016, Ukrainian prosecutors revealed that Paul Manafort, who at the time was serving as Trump’s campaign manager, may have received millions of dollars in payments from Ukrainian companies and politicians who were believed to make up a corrupt pro-Russia network.
The prosecutors, along with the Ukrainian government’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau, gave interviews and materials to the New York Times so that it could run an extensive report on Manafort’s involvement in the matter.
That story included the detail that the NACB “has an evidence-sharing agreement with the FBI.”
Guess who was secretly investigating the Trump campaign at least one month before that Times story published? The FBI was, and we still don’t really know why, or who initiated the investigation.
The evidence connecting Manafort to the pro-Russia ring in Ukraine is almost comical. It was an accounting book that had his name handwritten inside, along with other names and monetary figures. How was it found? "In the burned-out ruins" of an office building in Kiev, according to the guy who produced it, an anti-Russia politician in Ukraine. How did he get his hands on it? "An anonymous source," he says. (I wonder if the source's initials are anything like "FBI.")
That Times report kicked off the now-debunked conspiracy theory that Trump is an agent of Russia. But at the time, it just embarrassed the Trump campaign, resulting in Manafort’s resignation as its manager, and eventually his conviction and imprisonment.
The reason why Ukraine got involved in the 2016 election was obvious. Trump had been saying he wanted the U.S. to have a more constructive relationship with Russia, which has been engaged in military conflict with Ukraine since 2014. Lev Golinkin, a journalist originally from Ukraine, laid the whole thing out in an article for the ultra-liberal Nation magazine back in late September.
“Ukrainians certainly had every reason to expose Manafort’s corruption, and the man’s subsequent trial showed there was an enormous amount to expose,” wrote Golinkin. “But Ukraine’s efforts also happened to coincide with—and have an immediate impact on—an American campaign. And yet, despite this information's being available in English, and published by established Western media, we’ve had almost no debate about its implications.”
We’re about to have that debate now, though I don’t think Democrats are looking forward to it.

¿Por qué capturaron y soltaron al Ovidio Guzmán, el hijo de ‘El Chapo’? Circulan varias versiones

Texto completo: Más allá de la versión oficial, han florecido múltiples las hipótesis sobre lo que pasó con la captura efímera de Ovidio Guzmán López, el hijo de “El Chapo “. Tras su aprehensión el 17 de octubre, un grupo de civiles fuertemente armados salieron al rescate de Guzmán López. Y lo consiguieron.
En las horas que duró la detención del narcotraficante, la violencia se apoderó de las calles de Culiacán, Sinaloa (México) y dejó alrededor de 13 muertos. Después de la puesta en libertad, los medios empezaron a hacerse eco de lo que ocurrió a lanzar versiones diferentes.
El gobierno justificó su decisión diciendo que quería evitar una “masacre” en Culiacán ya que los militares se habían precipitado , eran pocos y carecían de una orden de cateo. Según cuenta Univision, el ejecutivo mexicano la ofensiva del cartel de Sinaloa -cuyo bastión es Culiacán- rebasó en poco tiempo al ejército y grupos de sicarios acudieron a las afueras de un complejo residencial donde viven familiares de los soldados para amenazar al gobierno.
El presidente, Andrés Manuel López Obrador , dijo en una de sus “mañaneras” que no se arrepiente de su gestión ante el conflicto ya que, en sus propias palabras, “nosotros no vamos a optar nunca por la guerra, por la confrontación o por el uso de la fuerza. Lo que nos importa es la vida de las personas”. “Yo tengo mi conciencia tranquila y sé que actuamos de manera correcta”, aseguró el mandatario.
Se barajan al menos cuatro razones detrás de los hechos que ocurrieron en Culiacán el 17 de octubre:
1. La intervención de ‘El Mayo’ Zambada es una de las versiones que han citado medios que no creen que la célula criminal de Ovidio Guzmán haya actuado sola. Según esta hipótesis, el capo Ismael ‘El Mayo’ Zambada, que lleva más de tres décadas al frente la organización criminal, ayudó a coordinar las acciones violentas que forzaron al Gobierno a replegar el ejército . Además, el exagente de la DEA Jack Riley dijo al semanario Proceso que es posible que Zambada haya impedido la detención de otro miembro de los Guzmán. J. Jesús Esquivel, experto en narcotráfico de esta misma revista, aseguró que “en Culiacán y en ningún lugar de Sinaloa se mueve un dedo sin la bendición y autorización de […] ‘El Mayo’ Zambada.
2. El periodista de The New York Times, Alan Freuer, dijo en Twitter que, además de a Ovidio, los militares también arrestaron a su hermano Iván Archivaldo . De acuerdo con esta versión, Archivaldo conseguiría primero la libertad y se encargaría de dirigir la ofensiva que acabaría en la liberación de Ovidio Guzmán . Para conseguirlo, Freuer comenta que habrían secuestrado a familiares de los soldados.
3. El ejército mexicano insiste, según Univision, en que sus soldados solo rodearon la vivienda en la que se encontraba Ovidio pero “nunca estuvo formalmente detenido . Sin embargo, un audio viral de un supuesto militar contradice la versión oficial afirmando que “cumplimos con el objetivo de detener a un delincuente”. “Se estima que eran entre 700 y 800 delincuentes -continúa el audio-. Solo 350 de nosotros le hicimos frente”. Esta grabación, adelanta Univision, aún no se ha confirmado.
4. El diario The Wall Street Journal informó de que los soldados bajaron las armas porque, entre los videos que recibieron, uno muestra como rehenes a los miembros de una patrulla . En otro se ve a un soldado ejecutado con un disparo en la cabeza, según dijo un exfuncionario al citado diario. Por otro lado, Marcelo Erbrard, canciller mexicano, reconoció que miembros del crimen organizado se colocaron el jueves frente a viviendas de familiares del ejército esperando la orden para abrir fuego.

Texto completo: Con el inicio de la temporada de patinaje en las dos pistas de hielo en Central Park, los visitantes notarán que la marca “Trump” ya no está.
La impopularidad del mandatario Donald Trump entre muchos neoyorquinos ha llevado a que su nombre sea despojado de algunas propiedades privadas en su ciudad natal, incluido el hotel Trump SoHo -ahora llamado Dominick-, y algunos condominios de Trump Place en Manhattan.
Las pistas, dos de varias concesiones públicas que opera en la ciudad la Organización Trump -el principal vehículo comercial de la familia presidencial-, continuaron mostrando el nombre de manera prominente hasta la primavera pasada.
“Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas, la compañía realizó un cambio significativo, eliminando el nombre de Trump en silencio y sin explicación”, destacó The New York Times.
La presencia de la marca familiar disminuyó considerablemente. Desapareció por completo de los tableros.
El nombre “Trump” quedó reducido a una “T” solitaria sobre el mostrador de alquiler de patines, en letra pequeña en la parte inferior de un letrero con las horas y tarifas.
Los cambios en las pistas, reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post, no fueron solicitados ni requeridos por el Ayuntamiento, dijeron las autoridades.
La Organización Trump -que dirige las pistas Wollman y Lasker, ubicadas en los extremo sureste y noroeste del parque-, informó en el verano a los funcionarios del parque que planeaba alterar la señalización, sin proporcionar detalles ni una justificación.
Un representante de la Organización Trump no ha respondido a una solicitud de comentarios. Los ejecutivos han dicho en el pasado que la opinión pública del presidente no había afectado el negocio de la compañía.
“No hay conexión con la política y el uso de usuarios en nuestras instalaciones aquí en Nueva York”, dijo el año pasado Ronald C. Lieberman, vicepresidente ejecutivo del grupo.

Trump's company wipes his name from its NYC skating rinks

Texto completo: NEW YORK — With skating season kicking off at Central Park's two rinks, those returning to the ice may notice a lot less of something that was conspicuous in the past: President Trump's name.
Trump's unpopularity among many New Yorkers has led to his name being stripped from some private properties in New York, including the Trump SoHo hotel, now the Dominick, and some former Trump Place condos. But the rinks — two of several public concessions the Trump Organization operates in the city — continued to flash the name prominently through last spring. In recent weeks, though, the company made a significant change, removing the Trump name quietly and without explanation.
At Wollman Rink, Trump's name had long been splashed all over the site, which he has run since taking it on as a rescue mission in the 1980s: in big red letters on the dasher boards' inner walls, on signs listing rules for skaters, and in big letters near the cashier and skate rental. But Tuesday, the name was gone from the boards, replaced by logos saying “Wollman Rink NYC Central Park." It was buried in small type at the bottom of a sign listing hours and fees. And it was represented by a lone “T" over the skate rental counter.
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The changes at the rinks were not sought or required by City Hall, officials said. — NEW YORK TIMES
Biden, too, used a reference to lynching — in 1998
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden apologized Tuesday night for for using the phrase "partisan lynching" two decades ago to describe an impeachment proceeding. It came several hours after Biden called President Trump "despicable" and "abhorrent" for saying the impeachment proceedings against him amounted to a "lynching."
It is rare for Biden to offer a fulsome apology; his usually fall into the "I really regret some have taken totally out of context" category, as in 2007, when he called then-candidate Barack Obama, for whom he would later be vice president, "articulate and bright and clean." Tuesday's apology marked how potentially significant his campaign viewed his use of the word.
Unlike his Democratic primary rivals, Biden has often had to clean up his past comments before taking a shot at Trump. The latest example: Trump on Tuesday said the impeachment inquiry amounted to a lynching. Biden and many other Democrats and Republicans denounced his use of the word and said it was intended to deepen racial wounds.
"Impeachment is not 'lynching,' it is part of our Constitution," Biden tweeted. "Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching, and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent. It's despicable."
But Tuesday night, CNN unearthed a video of Biden in 1998 using a similar phrase while talking about the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
"Even if the president should be impeached, history is going to question whether or not this was just a partisan lynching or whether or not it was something that in fact met the standard, the very high bar, that was set by the founders as to what constituted an impeachable offense," Biden said in an interview with Wolf Blitzer.
"This wasn't the right word to use and I'm sorry about that," Biden tweeted Tuesday. — WASHINGTON POST
Trump's hotel cancels aid group's tribute to Kurds
WASHINGTON — A Christian aid group that planned a gathering to honor and pray for the Kurdish people at President Trump's hotel were told by hotel staff this week that the event was canceled, two members of the group said. "A Night of Prayer for the Kurds" was to be hosted by Frontier Alliance International, a religious nonprofit that provides medical help in the Middle East, its website said.
In recent weeks, Trump pulled US soldiers out of Syria, paving the way for an invasion by Turkey that targeted Kurdish forces. The fighting has prompted Kurdish refugees to flood out of Syria and caused a political headache for the president, who has been accused by Republicans and Democrats alike of abandoning a US ally.
The aid group's founder, Dalton Thomas, said the reasons behind the cancellation were "hazy," adding, "all we know is they canceled."
The group's administrator, Charlene Struebing, said hotel staff expressed "security concerns." Critics of FAI's decision to hold its event at the Trump hotel had planned to protest outside, she said. — WASHINGTON POST
Giuliani associates' case may see executive-privilege claim
NEW YORK — One of two indicted associates of President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Wednesday tied the case to the president himself, saying some of the evidence gathered in the campaign finance investigation may be subject to executive privilege.
The argument was raised by a defense lawyer in federal court as Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman pleaded not guilty to federal charges they made illegal contributions to US political candidates in exchange for potential influence.
They have become unexpected figures in events at the heart of the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, having played a role in helping Giuliani's efforts on behalf of Trump to dig up information in Ukraine that could damage former vice president Joe Biden.
Giuliani denies wrongdoing but has acknowledged he and the two men worked with Ukrainian officials to collect damaging information about the US ambassador to Ukraine and other targets of Trump, including Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
Edward MacMahon, a lawyer for Parnas, told the judge in the case that the potential for the White House to invoke executive privilege stemmed from the fact that Parnas had used Giuliani as his own lawyer at the same time Giuliani was working as Trump's lawyer.
Parnas and Fruman were charged earlier this month with concealing the source of political donations in order to advance their own business interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials.
Trump and Giuliani were not named in the indictment, though prosecutors are investigating whether Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the inquiry. — NEW YORK TIMES

Conspiracy theories galore in war on truth Hillary Clinton goes Joe McCarthy to further poison information ecosystem Z on TV

Texto completo: For the last year, I have been writing about a war on truth through disinformation, propaganda and lies - often coming straight from the White House. I thought I had a good sense of how poisoned our information ecosystem had become and how dangerous that was to democracy. But last week when I heard Hillary Clinton suggest on a podcast that she believed congresswoman and Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard was being "groomed" by Russia as a third-party presidential candidate and that former Green Party candidate Jill Stein was a Russian "asset," I realized even my most pessimistic assessments came nowhere near communicating how profoundly polluted with conspiracy theories the political conversation in mainstream American life had become.
Alex Jones, sure. Donald Trump, absolutely. But you, too, Hillary? You, the victim of the infamous (and false) Comet Ping Pong Pizzagate calumny, are now casting unsupported conspiracies that smear candidates for president upon the troubled waters of American political life?
I was not the only one shocked by Ms. Clinton's words to be sure. But in our brave new world of nanosecond news cycles, we are already moving on to the latest blasts of chaos courtesy of President Trump, like his referring Monday to the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution as "phony" while comparing himself to George Washington. Or, how about the stunning images of Kurds throwing rocks and rotten potatoes at American troops as they left Syria abandoning our allies on Trump's orders?
We need to hit the pause button, step back and think about the deeper meaning of what Ms. Clinton did if we want to understand how far we are today from having a dependable flow of trustworthy information that we can use to make solid decisions about our lives, like who should get our votes in 2020. Without such a stream of information, a functioning democracy is impossible.
While I have often focused on the kind of propaganda fervent Trump apologists like Boris Epshteyn, chief political analyst for the Sinclair Broadcast Group, or Fox News host Sean Hannity serve up on a daily basis, Peter Pomerantsev, author of "This Is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality," says attention should be paid to how conspiracy theories have been used elsewhere to attack truth.
"The media manipulation of the early Putin years didn't try to convince you of a fabricated version of 'truth,' " Mr. Pomerantsev, a former resident of Moscow now living in Britain, wrote in a recent New York Times article. "Instead, it worked by seeding doubt and confusion, evoking a world so full of endlessly intricate conspiracies that you, the little guy, had no chance to work out or change. Instead of conspiracy theories being used to buttress an ideology as under Communist rule, a conspiratorial worldview replaced ideology as a way to explain the world, encouraging the public to trust nothing and yearn for a strong leader to guide it through the murk -a tactic that's as common in Washington these days as in Moscow."
Indeed, enter the the guy with the orange hair and red hat, doing his best Benito Mussolini, strong-man-in-profile pose at the podium of his raucous rallies as he promises to fight for those in the hall against the elites "rigging" the system against them.
There is a method to Mr. Trump's use of conspiracy theories. Mainly, he uses them to muddy the waters and cause confusion when he is under attack. When Mr. Trump came under impeachment-level fire, after a whistleblower brought his effort to strong-arm the president of Ukraine into trying to dig up dirt on Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, Mr. Trump went on the conspiracy offensive.
No, Mr. Trump said on Oct. 4, it's Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who should be investigated - Hunter Biden for alleged corruption involving $50,000 a month in salary he received from a Ukrainian energy company that he sat on the board of, and Joe Biden for his dealings while he was vice president with a Ukrainian prosecutor. (There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either of the Bidens.)
I watched Mr. Trump take questions from the press before boarding his helicopter Oct. 4, and the words "Biden" and "corruption" kept ringing in my ears. He kept linking the two words over and over during the session until all other narratives and details were lost.
And Mr. Trump's mantra of "Biden" and "corruption" worked to a certain extent with the mainstream press. From The New York Times on down, the weekend papers on Oct. 5 and 6 were filled with stories wondering why Mr. Biden seemed to be struggling so hard to respond to the charges from Mr. Trump. Mr. Biden was now the one on the defensive.
My favorite crazy Ukraine conspiracy moment involved Mr. Trump saying on Sept. 25 without a shred of evidence that he thinks some of the 33,000 emails an aide to Ms. Clinton had ordered deleted in 2016 "could be" in Ukraine, and that was one of things he wanted Ukraine to investigate.
Ms. Clinton's deleted emails possibly being in Ukraine is laughable. But there is nothing funny about the degree of confusion, cynicism, paranoia and even sense of hopelessness such a surfeit of conspiracy theories has caused among citizens.
And now even Ms. Clinton is part of the problem, and the press isn't helping. I am surprised at how some of my colleagues who know better have held their fire on Ms. Clinton for what she said on "Campaign HQ" podcast hosted by David Plouffe, architect of Barack Obama's winning strategy in 2008.
CNN host Van Jones, a former aide to President Obama, was one analyst who did not hold back on Clinton, and good for him.
"If you're concerned about disinformation ... that is what just happened. Just throw out some information, disinformation, smear somebody," Mr. Jones said of Ms. Clinton's remarks in a conversation on CNN with Erin Burnett on Friday night.
"She is Hillary Clinton. She's a legend. She's going to be in the history books. She's a former nominee of our party, and she just came out against a sitting U.S. congresswoman, a decorated war veteran and somebody who's running for the nomination of our party, with just a complete smear and no facts," he added. "If you've got real evidence, come forward with it. But if you're just going to smear people casually on podcasts, you are playing right into the Russians' hands."
While the Times and others have written about what appeared to be social media support for Gabbard from possible Russian sites, no one in the mainstream press went anywhere near the dark place Clinton went. What Clinton did last week is as bad or worse than what Joe McCarthy, the drunken, slanderous, career-wrecking, red-baiting senator from Wisconsin did in the 1950s calling people working in the U.S. government agents, assets and spies for Russia often without a shred of proof and embedding such charges in a larger, menacing narrative of conspiracy.
Clinton is old enough to know that history and wise enough, I thought until last week, to despise the damage McCarthy did to innumerable personal lives as well as the public life of the nation during the Cold War years.
There are far more conspiracies today and far more media platforms with no sense of editorial standards willing to promote them.
More's the pity for democracy.

Anonymous Trump Official Behind Op-Ed in The Times Is Writing a Book

Texto completo: "A Warning," by the White House official who wrote an essay for The New York Times last year, is expected to be published in November.
An anonymous Trump administration official who published a September 2018 essay in The New York Times, about the active resistance to the president's agenda and behavior from within his own administration, will publish a book next month.
The author, who has not been publicly identified, created an uproar when he or she wrote in an Op-Ed last year that many of President Trump's senior officials "are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations," adding, "I would know. I am one of them."
The book, titled, "A Warning," will be published on Nov. 19 by Twelve, a division of the Hachette Book Group. The author, who will remain unnamed in the book, is represented by Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn of Javelin, the literary agency that represents the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, Senator Martha McSally and the retired United States Navy commander Guy Snodgrass.
In a news release announcing the book, the publisher said that the author did not receive an advance, and would be donating any royalties to nonprofit organizations that focus on government accountability and press freedom.
"The author could have easily gotten a seven figure advance and the author refused it," Mr. Latimer said in an interview with the Times. "The book is a public service, in the author's view."
In a withering statement, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said: "It takes a lot of conviction and bravery to write a whole book anonymously."
[Our Op-Ed editor, James Dao, answered readers' questions on The Times's decision to publish the anonymous Op-Ed last year.]
News of the deal was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
The announcement comes at a precarious time for Mr. Trump, who faces an impeachment inquiry, scrutiny of his foreign policy decisions regarding Syria and Ukraine, and criticism of his now-abandoned decision to host next year's Group of 7 meeting at the Trump National Doral resort near Miami.
"A Warning" is also likely to become the latest explosive tell-all about the Trump administration, following headline-grabbing books by former government officials such as Mr. Comey, the former deputy F.B.I. director Andrew G. McCabe, the former Trump aide Cliff Sims, and the former reality TV star and White House official Omarosa Manigault Newman.
In the 2018 Op-Ed, the author described a systematic effort within the administration to "preserve our democratic institutions" by defying some of Mr. Trump's directives. "There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first," the author wrote.
The essay sparked criticism from both liberals and Democrats who felt the administration official should resign and come forward publicly, and from Trump supporters who denounced the official as a "deep state" operative undermining the president's agenda. Mr. Trump himself argued that the official was guilty of "treason" and posed a national security risk, and he suggested that his then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions should use law enforcement to investigate the official.
The unnamed official, whose identity is known to the Times editorial page department but not to the news department or the reporters who cover the White House, has managed to remain anonymous for more than a year in spite of frenzied efforts to uncover the person's identity.
On Twitter, much of the discussion after the news was published Tuesday revolved around guesses about the author's identity and decision to remain anonymous. "At a time when State Department employees are risking their careers to testify about wrongdoing in this administration, I can't think of anyone I want to hear from less than this person," tweeted Matthew Miller, a former director of the Justice Department's Office of Public Affairs in the Obama administration.
It's unclear whether the official remains in the administration, given the high turnover in Mr. Trump's cabinet, and how much additional and specific detail the book will offer regarding the president's behavior and misgivings that members of his own administration might have.
Keeping the author's identity under wraps may prove tricky with the release of a book-length work -- Amazon lists "A Warning" as a 272-page book -- which offers a greater opportunity for clues to his or her identity as well as increasingly sophisticated forensic author identification software, which matches prose style to other published works. Such software has been used to solve literary mysteries and unmask authors writing under pseudonyms, including J.K. Rowling, who published mystery novels as Robert Galbraith.
There's a long American tradition of anonymously published political writing, including "Common Sense," which Thomas Paine originally released anonymously in the 1770s at the beginning of the American Revolution, and the Federalist Papers, which were published under a collective pen name. But previous attempts at writing anonymous political books have fallen apart quickly: Just a few months after the publication of "Primary Colors," a thinly veiled 1996 novel about Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign, the journalist Joe Klein was outed as its author.
Sean Desmond, the publisher of Twelve, said that there were good reasons for the author to remain unnamed.
"Anonymous explains in the book why they won't reveal themselves as the author -- and I found those arguments persuasive," Mr. Desmond said. "And part of the reason for the anonymity, I think, is to present the story of this Administration without filter, without fear of reprisal from the President, and to tell the truth about what's going on in this White House."

Texto completo: The men had been convicted of taking part in an attack on protesters outside the Metropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan.
When nearly a dozen members of the far-right Proud Boys assaulted a handful of black-clad protesters on the Upper East Side last year, videos of the fighting generated outrage and drew comparisons to similar conflicts between the right and left that had taken place across the country.
Those battles -- in places like Berkeley, Calif., Portland, Ore., and Charlottesville, Va. -- pitted far-right groups denouncing communism against self-described anti-fascists known as Antifa, who say that the right-wing groups are a threat that should be countered with physical force.
On Tuesday, a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan cited that recent history as he sentenced two members of the Proud Boys, Maxwell Hare and John Kinsman, each to four years in prison, for taking part in a "political street fight."
Justice Mark Dwyer said the punishment was meant in part to deter others who seek to resolve political differences through partisan violence.
"I know enough about history to know what happened in Europe in the 30s when political street brawls were allowed to go ahead without any type of check from the criminal justice system," he said.
"We don't want that to happen in New York," Justice Dwyer added, "especially at this time in the country when people are so divided."
Mr. Hare, 27, and Mr. Kinsman, 40, were among ten men who prosecutors said attacked four people protesting a speech at the Metropolitan Republican Club by the Proud Boys founder, Gavin McInnes.
The masked protesters, who did not cooperate with the police, were believed to be self-described anti-fascists.
Both defendants were convicted in August of attempted gang assault, attempted assault and riot. Seven others charged in the incident pleaded guilty. One defendant is awaiting trial.
In court on Tuesday, a prosecutor, Joshua Steinglass recommended that Justice Dwyer sentence Mr. Hare and Mr. Kinsman to five years in prison, saying "violence meant to intimidate and silence" should have no place in society.
He cited a history of conflict between the Proud Boys -- who are generally supporters of President Trump and disdain liberals, feminists and Islam -- and Antifa, a loose affiliation of left-leaning activists.
"In cities across America these two groups have repeatedly engaged in violence against one another," he added. "It became clear during this trial that violence is very much ingrained in the Proud Boys ethos."
The defendants apologized for their actions. Mr. Hare, 27, who initiated the attack last October, said: "I made a mistake that night."
Mr. Kinsman, 40, whom a prosecutor had called "the single most vicious of all the attackers," said: "I regret the entire incident."
The brawl focused attention on the Proud Boys, whose members have sometimes shown up at rallies that attracted overtly racist organizations.
After the clash, Facebook and Instagram banned the Proud Boys and Mr. McInnes announced that he was quitting the group, saying it had been unfairly connected to white nationalists and white supremacists, while adding that "such people don't exist."
Mr. McInnes, who co-founded Vice Magazine, had promoted his appearance at the Republican club by saying he would re-enact the 1960 murder of a Japanese socialist leader by a teenage ultranationalist.
The night before the event, hooded figures broke windows at the club and left behind fliers promising future attacks and labeling Mr. McInnes a "hipster-fascist clown."
As Mr. McInnes spoke inside the club, protesters outside chanted "No Nazis, no K.K.K., no fascist U.S.A!" Police directed departing Proud Boys away from the crowd, telling them to walk down Park Avenue.
A handful of black-clad protesters, some wearing masks, went around the block to intercept the Proud Boys, the police said.
Mr. McInnes and defense lawyers said the protesters attacked the Proud Boys. But a surveillance video obtained by The New York Times contradicted those claims, showing that the protesters had halted 100 feet away from the Proud Boys on Park Avenue and that Mr. Hare had first walked and then run toward them.
As Mr. Hare charged, one protester threw a plastic bottle that sailed past him, the video showed. Within moments, videos showed, a crowd of Proud Boys surrounded the protesters and began punching and kicking them.
The four victims of the beating refused to speak with the police and were never identified; an indictment referred to them as Shaved Head, Ponytail, Khaki and Spiky Belt. Because the four did not testify, the defendants were charged with attempted assault, which requires evidence of intent to cause injury, rather than assault, which requires evidence of injury.
During the trial, defense lawyers suggested that the authorities sympathized with the protesters and had not tried to track them down. Mr. Kinsman's lawyer, Jack Goldberg, referred to prosecutors with the district attorney's office as being part of the "district Antifa office."
A police detective testified that while looking for the protesters, who could have faced charges, the department had sought information from the F.B.I. and "monitored" what he called Antifa meetings.
The district attorney's office had worked hard to find the protesters, one of their investigators testified, and had obtained a search warrant to check records of certain cellphones in specific spots on the Upper East Side.
Although Mr. McInnes had distanced himself from the Proud Boys and was not involved in the trial, prosecutors repeatedly tied him to the group, calling him a "hatemonger" who had encouraged violence and made racist comments, including one in which he referred to President Barack Obama as a "monkey."
Without victims to put on the stand, the prosecutors leaned heavily on video from multiple sources that showed the attack from various angles. They also introduced into evidence a video created by a Proud Boy member, Christopher Wright, that showed others in the group, including both defendants, exulting after the attack or reprising their parts in it.
Mr. Hare and Mr. Kinsman both testified, saying that they had been intimidated by the protesters outside the Republican club, whom they believed to be menacing hooligans, and had fought only in self-defense.
The defendants portrayed the Proud Boys as nothing more than a fraternity for like-minded friends. Mr. Hare said they were "a group of blue collar men who love America." Mr. Kinsman said he had joined at his wife's urging to find "drinking buddies" and considered Mr. McInnes to be "a regular conservative dude."
Some of their testimony, however, may have undermined the peaceful image that the two defendants sought to project. During cross-examination Mr. Hare acknowledged that he had posed for a photograph holding an AR-15 rifle and an image of a defaced Antifa flag.
He also conceded that a week before the incident in New York he had punched somebody in the face while providing security in Rhode Island for a far-right rally.
And Mr. Kinsman testified that he had attended a "fake news" protest outside of the CNN offices in Manhattan and taken part in a rally in support of Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defense League, an anti-Islam and anti-immigration movement known for violent street actions.
Justice Dwyer appeared to lay some of the blame for the violence at the feet of Mr. McInnes. Though he did not mention the Proud Boys founder by name, the judge referred to the leadership of the group.
"It's a shame when some people jump up and down on a platform," the judge said, "and their followers, their soldiers, get in trouble."

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Mark Zuckerberg hopes that one day, in the not too distant future, billions of people will use a cryptocurrency created by Facebook to send money to friends and family around the world.
Mr. Zuckerberg also recognizes that his company is a major impediment to that vision.
Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, is expected to admit as much on Wednesday when he testifies about his company's cryptocurrency project at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.
"I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we're not the ideal messenger right now," Mr. Zuckerberg will say, according to written testimony submitted before the hearing. "I know some people wonder whether we can be trusted to build payment services that protect consumers."
A torrent of criticism has been directed toward Facebook's cryptocurrency effort, called Libra, since it was announced in June. But the company is pressing on. And Facebook officials over the last week have been on a charm offensive with regulators and lawmakers in Washington, leading up to Wednesday's hearing.
In his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to promote the benefits of Libra. He plans to describe Libra as a democratizing financial system that will mostly benefit the poor, as well as the estimated 14 million people in the United States who do not have access to bank accounts and who cannot afford banking fees.
"People pay far too high a cost -- and have to wait far too long -- to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them," Mr. Zuckerberg said in the advance version of his testimony. "The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help."
Facebook's cryptocurrency project is the latest controversy to draw Mr. Zuckerberg to Washington.
Last week, he delivered a manifesto on free expression at Georgetown University, defying requests by Democratic politicians to take down false and misleading information by political leaders. Weeks earlier, he met with President Trump and Republican lawmakers to beat down accusations that Facebook gives priority to liberal-leaning content.
The House hearing will be the second time Mr. Zuckerberg has testified on Capitol Hill. In 2018, he was asked to respond to claims that the company did not properly handle its users' data and had not treated privacy concerns with seriousness.
A few weeks after Libra was unveiled, Maxine Waters, Democrat from California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, led several lawmakers in a call for Facebook to stop the project until it was vetted by lawmakers and regulators. David Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of Libra, appeared before Ms. Waters's committee in July, but he appeared to make little progress toward détente with the lawmakers.
Central bankers around the world have also expressed concerns about Libra. And regulators say they do not have clear answers on how Facebook will handle important tasks like preventing criminal activity and ensuring the privacy of users.
Facebook officials envision Libra being incorporated into the company's various messaging services, like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It could, over time, create a new revenue stream for the company.
Though Facebook said it plans to allow people to use the cryptocurrency free, executives proposed offering different types of consumer financial services if the cryptocurrency catches on. Calibra, the separate entity Facebook has created to work on the Libra project, could ultimately offer financial products to people who regularly use Libra -- much as a bank would.
Facebook originally brought on 27 partners to join a Libra Association in Switzerland that is supposed to govern the network. But several big-name partners, including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, have dropped out in recent weeks.
In his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg will say that Facebook will not allow the project to move forward until it gains the approval of the necessary regulators.
"Even though the Libra Association is independent and we don't control it, I want to be clear: Facebook will not be part of launching the Libra payments system anywhere in the world until U.S. regulators approve," he is expected to say.
The committee oversees housing, and Ms. Waters is expected to press Mr. Zuckerberg on accusations that Facebook has allowed discriminatory ad targeting for housing.

Texto completo: The defense secretary's son worked for one of the contract's original bidders.
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper recused himself from reviewing a controversial $ 10 billion cloud-computing contract because his son works for one of the contract's original bidders, the Defense Department said on Tuesday.
The decision removes Mr. Esper from a fierce lobbying battle between Amazon Web Services, the dominant player in the field of cloud computing, and Oracle. President Trump himself has weighed in over the 10-year contract to transform the military's computing systems, making clear his own hostility toward Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos.
"Out of an abundance of caution to avoid any concerns regarding his impartiality," the defense secretary has delegated decision-making concerning the contract, known as JEDI, to the deputy defense secretary, David L. Norquist, a Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said in a statement.
The statement attributed the recusal to Mr. Esper's "adult son's employment with one of the original contract applicants," but did not specify the company. The statement also did not identify the adult son by name, but the LinkedIn page for Mr. Esper's son Luke Esper describes him as a digital strategy consultant at IBM, which was an original bidder for the contract.
What began as a technological competition to remake the military's aging, often incompatible computer systems took on political overtones in recent months.
Experts had believed the contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known by the acronym JEDI, would go to Amazon. But in August, shortly after taking over as defense secretary, Mr. Esper said the contract would not be awarded until he reviewed the matter. That announcement came just two weeks after Mr. Trump said he would be looking "very seriously" at the contract process.
Mr. Trump said at the time that he was receiving "tremendous complaints" from competitors of Amazon Web Services. The president has made no secret of his dislike of Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post. When angered by the paper's coverage, Mr. Trump often refers to it on Twitter as the "Amazon Washington Post."
In public and private, Mr. Trump has questioned why Mr. Bezos should profit from one of the biggest leaps in Pentagon technology in decades.

A 'lynching' is something Donald Trump will never know

Texto completo: Donald Trump says we're witnessing a lynching.
He refers to the impeachment inquiry as a lynching. Merriam-Webster defines lynch as “to put to death (as by hanging) by mob action without legal approval or permission."
“So some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights," he tweeted Tuesday morning. “All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here — a lynching. But we will WIN!"
A lynching isn't something you can win. Emmett Till was lynched. He was 14 years old.
In 1955, Till was a Chicago teen visiting family in Mississippi. A white woman claimed he grabbed her, whistled at her, and made crude comments. She lied. Her husband and his friend kidnapped him, tortured him beyond recognition, and shot him in the head.
They used barbed wire to tie his body to a cotton gin fan and threw him into the Tallahatchie River. His killers were acquitted by an all-white jury.
What happened to Till? That is a lynching. Last Saturday, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission unveiled the fourth marker dedicated to him since 2008, when the original sign was stolen. The signs have been taken, vandalized, and shot at over and over.
The latest memorial is bulletproof. Sixty-four years after his murder, racists don't want us to remember Till and the racist violence that eats at the soul of America.
Not enough of us learn about the true history of the country in school. When “Watchmen" debuted on HBO Sunday night, it opened with the Greenwood massacre, the terrorist attack of a Tulsa neighborhood known as “Black Wall Street," where there were 300 black-owned businesses.
The scenes show black people murdered in the street, businesses on fire, and a plane dropping a bomb. This is not TV exaggeration. This happened in America. And it was clear from social media Sunday night and all day Monday that thousands of viewers had never heard of what is referred to as the “Tulsa Race Riot."
It's been almost 100 years, and this month, archeologists are searching Tulsa for evidence of mass graves. At least 300 black men, women, and children were murdered; 10,000 were displaced. And it took a brilliant television show to get the country talking about it.
Be clear. There was no riot. It was terrorism inflicted on black people by white supremacists, the kind of people Trump likes to believe are “very fine." Trump is the same man who called Black Lives Matter activist Mercutio Southall Jr. disgusting and said he deserved to be “roughed up" by Trump supporters at a rally in November 2015.
The delight he takes in the pain of black people, the way he encouraged the country to turn against football players protesting police brutality and oppression — this is the way of supremacy. Racists used to smile and pose for pictures during lynchings.
Trump believes in the lynching of black people. In 1989, he spent some $85,000 on full-page ads to bring back the death penalty to execute Korey Wise, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Kevin Richardson. Teenagers. Five black and brown boys wrongfully accused of raping a white woman. He wanted The Central Park Five, now known as The Exonerated Five, dead. He didn't care about proof. He just wanted murder.
Last year, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice opened in Alabama. The site includes 800 6-foot monuments to symbolize thousands of racial terror lynching victims — the Equal Justice Initiative researchers documented 4,075 victims between 1877 and 1950.
It is the nation's first memorial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved black people, people terrorized by lynching, racial segregation, and Jim Crow. People who even in 2019 are considered a threat upon sight, their skin criminalized.
Earlier this month, Atatiana Jefferson was killed by a police officer who was supposed to be performing a safety check. Black people are not safe in this country. But Trump considers his impeachment inquiry a lynching.
People say it's a distraction and we shouldn't pay attention. Except we must. This is a man who encourages hate. His own supporters happily wear shirts that read, “Rope. Tree. Journalist. Some Assembly Required."
Two years ago, when I was a Kansas City Star columnist, I was swarmed with e-mails, phone calls, and letters laced with racist rhetoric and Trump support. The n-word was the norm in my inbox. The words “tar and feather" were a cheer.
“You are exactly why tall trees and ropes were made," a reader named Jeff from Montana wrote to me.
Any time I wrote about Trump or the NFL, or protested police brutality, I would get this kind of violent response. My life was threatened twice. One reader thought I should be tied to the back of a truck and dragged out of town.
This is not shocking. I am not an isolated incident. What I've experienced is subtle compared with what those who've come before me endured.
Ida B. Wells risked her life as an investigative journalist — a black woman, traveling the country and exposing the horrors of racism and lynching.
“Our country's national crime is lynching. It is not the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an insane mob," she said in a speech in 1900.
“It represents the cool, calculating deliberation of intelligent people who openly avow that there is an unwritten law that justifies them in putting human beings to death without complaint under oath, without trial by jury, without opportunity to make defense, and without right of appeal."
Black men were murdered for looking white men in the eye. Black women were raped by white men as punishment. We like to think of these things as America's tragic history.
Except black people are still dying. They are still being tortured. They are still being convicted upon sight.
We don't want to remember our racist truth. We want to shoot holes through America's reality the way supremacists tried to destroy the memory of Emmett Till.
It's easier to be retroactively heartbroken while learning of American tragedy and being entertained on HBO than it is to recognize the truth of right now.
Lynching was real. It happened. And the effects of lynch culture live on today.
Police brutality, the school-to-prison pipeline, segregated schools, excessive sentencing, and the continued racial inequity are all rooted in racism and the supremacist mentality that believed lynching was some sort of national justice.
Trump was right. We're witnessing a lynching. But it is not his.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump's decision over the weekend to no longer use his Doral golf resort in Miami to host next year's G7 Summit may rekindle chances for holding the large international event on Mackinac Island.
A spokesperson for the island's famous Grand Hotel said Monday that earlier this year, a group in charge of selecting the G7 host site did visit and tour the 397-room hotel.
The hotel spokesperson declined any further comment or speculation on what the recent change of plans could mean for the Grand Hotel being a future G7 site.
A Washington Post reporter said last month that Michigan was one of 12 sites in eight states that President Trump's team is said to have "vetted" as potential G7 hosts.
On Monday, a representative for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told the Free Press in a statement that "the state of Michigan is not aware of any formal vetting by the White House or the federal government to host the G7 Summit in Michigan at this time."
The G7 is an annual meeting of leaders of advanced industrialized democracies, and 2020 marks the U.S.'s turn to play host.
A former State Department official told the New York Times that the White House has traditionally picked the event's host city, with the State Department then selecting a specific hotel in that city. The event reportedly draws as many as 7,000 people, including the world leaders and their support and security staffs.
Trump broke with past protocol when announcing Oct. 17 that the G7 would happen at his Doral resort from June 10-12. The decision provoked instant criticism from Democrats, who questioned whether the president would personally profit from hosting the event at one of his properties, a possible violation of the emoluments clause in the constitution.
The Grand Hotel dates to 1887 and was sold this month a Denver-based private-equity firm, KSL Capital Partners, which focuses on travel and leisure companies. Terms of the sale, including whether the deal added debt to the property, were not disclosed.
Vice President Mike Pence made national headlines last month when he visited the Grand Hotel with an eight-vehicle motorcade, an usual arrangement on the island, which has a century-old ban on cars. Pence came to speak at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference.
The Grand Hotel also hosts the Detroit Regional Chamber's annual policy conference each May.

100 percent filch? Pair seek credit for Lizzo hit.

Texto completo: In a video published by Genius last month, producer Ricky Reed recalled collaborating with Lizzo on the breakout singer's now-ubiquitous sleeper hit "Truth Hurts." The song, which soared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart nearly two years after it was first released, is Lizzo's "most authentic record," Reed said. "When you listen to that song, you kind of feel like you know her a little bit."
But the song's empowering message now faces scrutiny as a pair of songwriting brothers claim they deserve to be credited as writers on the track. The line at the center of their complaint is, at this point, virtually synonymous with Lizzo, who reportedly filed to trademark the phrase and already features it on T-shirts sold on her website: "I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100 percent that b----."
As outlined in a New York Times article last week, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen argue that they should have received writing credits on the song because a variation of its signature line first appeared in "Healthy," an unreleased song they worked on with Lizzo, Reed and two other songwriters in an April 2017 studio session. After the brothers raised the issue in recent Instagram posts, Cynthia S. Arato, a lawyer for Lizzo, told the Times in a statement that the Raisens "did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else" on "Truth Hurts." The statement also asserted that the Raisens "renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
Songwriting disputes have a long legacy and can be notoriously fraught - as shown by recent high-profile copyright cases involving Robin Thicke's controversial megahit "Blurred Lines" and Katy Perry's "Dark Horse." The dispute over "Truth Hurts" is somewhat unusual, at least to industry outsiders, because it alleges that "Truth Hurts" borrowed from an unreleased song. And then there's the debate around the origins of the "DNA test" lyric, which some have said walks the line between inspiration and plagiarism.
In an interview with The Washington Post, veteran songwriter Justin Raisen said he never "knowingly signed away my rights or claims" but believes the statement from Arato refers to exasperated emails he and his brother sent after months of unsuccessful appeals to Lizzo's team and Reed, who signed the singer to his Atlantic Records imprint, Nice Life, in 2016. On Instagram, the brothers noted they had "tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years," beginning in September 2017 when Justin Raisen observed, in an email to his management company, that "you can literally sing 'Healthy' over the entirety of 'Truth Hurts.' " In January 2018, long before "Truth Hurts" entered the Hot 100, the Raisens' publisher put the song in dispute - essentially stalling the profits for its credited songwriters.
During the April writing session, Justin Raisen recalled, Lizzo landed on a beat produced by Jeremiah called "Healthy." The songwriters took to the Internet, absent-mindedly scrolling through memes about health and wellness. One stumbled across a phrase that Jeremiah Raisen insisted would be perfect for the track.
The Raisens' recent Instagram posts invite social media users to be the judge, juxtaposing the "DNA test" line in the "Truth Hurts" single with the line as Lizzo belted it on the "Healthy" demo: "I just did a DNA test, turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The final frame of the video plays both song snippets simultaneously.
The line adds an extra layer to the drama: As the Raisens acknowledged on social media, the meme that surfaced that day appears to have been inspired by a joke that Mina Lioness, a British singer, tweeted in February 2017: "I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that b----." Lioness has publicly called Lizzo out for not crediting her for the line; the singer said in a tweet last year that the line had been inspired by "a meme on" Instagram. "I give that meme credit when I talk about making the song," Lizzo wrote, noting that "Truth Hurts" was written in June 2017. "I've never seen ur viral tweet but I'm glad it exists."
Tweets are entitled to copyright protection "to the extent that what's being tweeted constitutes an original work of authorship," said Lisa Alter, a copyright lawyer not involved in the Lizzo dispute. But proving copyright infringement could be tough on a platform where users are often inclined to make the same jokes. Even if an expert found the tweet to be an original work, an artist could rely on a fair use defense, which can get complicated. "The courts are all over the place in evaluating" such cases, Alter said.
If the Raisens had merely suggested using the "DNA test" line they had seen in a meme, they would likely not have a copyright infringement case, Alter said, noting "an idea itself is not copyright." But the Raisens say their contribution went beyond that and hired a musicologist to attest as much in a recent report that said "Truth Hurts" borrowed both lyrical and melodic elements from "Healthy."
"The duplication of these distinctive elements in 'Truth' makes it difficult to argue that these similarities are the result of coincidence or that 'Truth' was independently created and did not copy these elements from 'Healthy,' " the report stated, ultimately concluding that " 'Truth Hurts' would not exist in its present form without the existence of and the borrowing from 'Healthy.' "
Justin Raisen, who called Lizzo "one of the most talented people" he has ever worked with, said it's in that spirit that he, his brother and another songwriter in the room - all recruited to collaborate with Lizzo and Reed - should be credited on "Truth Hurts"; he and his brother have each asked for 5 percent of the songwriting royalties. In addition to the meme-inspired lyric, the song's "melody was written over the beat that we came up with," Justin Raisen said.
A similar - though less detailed - claim surfaced earlier this year when Ariana Grande released "Thank U, Next," the album she recorded following her very public split with "Saturday Night Live" comic Pete Davidson and the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller. She has recounted how a group of girlfriends - including several songwriters - rallied around her in the studio, leading to the Tiffany's shopping trip that inspired "7 Rings."
As eagle-eyed fans noted the morning of the album's release, one "7 Rings" writer and ring recipient, Kimberly "Kaydence" Krysiuk, implied on Instagram that she should have received writing credits for additional songs. In a snappy, thinly veiled response, Victoria Monét, one of Grande's closest collaborators, wondered if the singer's dogs should also receive writing credits because "they were in the room too."
It's a dilemma that bands have long grappled with: What constitutes songwriting? And what passes for meaningful collaboration in a room full of people bringing different talents and skills to the table in the hope that they produce a song that resonates?
Not surprisingly, Alter recommends songwriters sign a contract to make terms clear. But she said it rarely happens.
"It's not a thing that songwriters who collaborate like to do because they're all good buddies," Alter said. "Every time we talk to young songwriters, we say, 'If you want to stay good friends, then you better write this down, because otherwise it could become an issue.' And there goes everything."

Texto completo: “I have tried to help the people of the world to make it a little better,” wrote James Naismith, basketball’s inventor, in 1918, reflecting on a life of Christian education and athletics. He would have choice words for today's National Basketball Association, which recently caved to foreign pressure and condemned Americans speaking in favor of democracy abroad.
The league confirmed Thursday that the Chinese government had sought the dismissal of Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey. His crime? Tweeting. “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,” Morey had tweeted earlier this month.
His auto-da-fé at the hands of the NBA was swift. League officials apologized for having “deeply offended” those in China. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta denounced Morey’s comments, promising “to play basketball and not to offend anybody.” Rockets star James Harden said, “We apologize. We love China.” On Wednesday, Superstar LeBron James condemned Morey’s tweet, warning that “many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually.”
Morey apologized and deleted the tweet.
The events cast into sharp relief Beijing’s increasing assertiveness in seeking the corporate subordination of core American values to Chinese market access.
The corporate motivation is obvious: China represents a billion-person market with an emerging middle class. The NBA began planning its China expansion in the late 1980s, and launched NBA China, with support from the Chinese Communist Party, in 2008. That subsidiary, following years of double-digit growth, is now worth some $4 billion. State-owned China Central Television, which the New York Times describes as “the Communist Party’s most influential propaganda mouthpiece,” airs games four nights each week. Last season, some 500 million Chinese reportedly watched an NBA game. The United States has a total population of 330 million.
Washington facilitated Beijing’s integration into the global economy with the assumption that economic liberalization would lead to political liberalization. “See, I think that the commerce thing, I think it’s been wrongly positioned as are you choosing money over values,” President Bill Clinton said in 1996. “It seems to me that if America is in the center of these emerging networks, it dramatically increases our leverage to work with people for peace, for human rights and for stability in the world.”
Instead, expansion into China may have done more to change the companies than it has done to change China. Rather than expose Chinese audiences to the best of American ideas and exports, basketball has become a tool of Chinese power. Joe Tsai, co-founder of Chinese conglomerate Alibaba, became the full owner of the Brooklyn Nets in August. In a CCP-compliant Facebook post, he condemned Morey’s tweet. The Nets played LeBron James’s Lakers twice in China last week.
All told, it is difficult to imagine a comparable reaction were the roles reversed, and not simply because Twitter is banned in China. So long as American companies refuse to act on their convictions, and the U.S. imposes no cost on China’s behavior, the CCP has no reason to seek win-win solutions. Only a determined opposition will alter a counterpart’s conduct.
But Washington and the NBA have options short of cutting ties or escalating a trade war to compel Beijing to change its behavior. In negotiating future airing rights, for example, the NBA could secure freely purchased commercials during broadcasts and streams, creating pockets of free air amid crushing censorship. If companies stand firm and the CCP refuses, it will have to answer to citizens grown accustomed to American clothes, films, and sports.
The federal government, meanwhile, can welcome Chinese businesses — foreign values and all — while drawing the line at gross human rights violations. Last Monday, the Department of Commerce listed 28 Chinese entities persecuting China’s Uighur citizens, determining that they were “acting contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States.” These restrictions, if used sparingly and with extensive public explanation, push companies to answer publicly for their activities, or abandon the U.S. market.
U.S. officials can also speak out. They could name the companies hewing entirely to CCP preference, giving Americans the information to act as conscientious consumers. Regarding the NBA, Democratic presidential candidates like Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang have denounced the NBA’s response to Morey’s tweet. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley released blistering statements as well. Other politicians should join them.
At the grassroots level, citizens and consumers can start publicly asking questions. Why does the NBA currently run a training camp in the capital of Xinjiang Province, where the CCP operates what the U.S. has called “concentration camps?” Why was the NBA’s Chinese-language apology far more strident than its English one? If free expression is core to the NBA, will its star players — and perhaps its next Chinese star — speak out about human rights abuses? Will the league permit it?
Now, the NBA is recalibrating by engaging in damage control. It released another statement aimed at an American audience invested — if only temporarily and recently — in league policies. “Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA,” it intoned. On Thursday, the league’s commissioner insisted, “American values … travel with us wherever we go.”
But the tape, as they say, tells a different story. When a CNN reporter asked Houston’s James Harden whether the incident would affect his political activism, a hand grabbed the microphone and a voice instructed, “basketball questions only.” When asked the same, Houston coach Mike D’Antoni deflected. “I coach basketball, I’m not a diplomat,” he said.
A diplomat he is not, but then, neither were the fans removed from NBA games in Washington and Philadelphia for quietly protesting for Hong Kong. In keeping the NBA in the news, these civilians challenge the corporate assumption that they matter but don’t mind. Companies now have to choose: either answer to the public or reveal their true minder. And that might not be a bad thing.

Texto completo: The ridiculous number of candidates on the Democratic stage Tuesday night created a fundamentally misleading aural and visual impression. Watching without access to polling data, you might have imagined that this was some sort of wild careening mess of a primary race, when really it’s remarkably consolidated.
There is a Joe Biden constituency that seems stable at around 30% of the primary electorate. There is an Elizabeth Warren constituency that has expanded swiftly enough, especially in early states, to make her arguably the front-runner. There is a Bernie Sanders constituency that is about two-thirds the size of Warren’s and Biden’s peak and seemingly stuck there. And then, way down at around 5% and under, there is everybody else.
So a big question in this debate and in the ones before Iowa arrives and the also-rans begin to be formally run out is whether Democratic voters can be persuaded to reconsider this consolidation. And last night there were only really two candidates who presented themselves as plausible vehicles for that reconsideration: Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.
As for the others — well, Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard are too niche, Beto O’Rourke is too limp, Julián Castro is too forgettable, and Tom Steyer is too absurd. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker should be contenders, but Booker manages to be appealing at every debate without quite finding a rationale for his candidacy, while Harris has been on a weird self-destruct mission ever since her brief ascent — with her strange fight with Warren on Tuesday night over whether Twitter should ban Donald Trump a particularly peculiar self-charted nosedive.
That leaves Buttigieg and Klobuchar, who both did well for themselves by arguing explicitly with Warren from more centrist ground and embracing the clearest rationales for their candidacies — which happen to be the same basic rationale: that they’re problem-solving Midwesterners with realistic policy blueprints who can win swing states, and (less explicitly) that they’re like Biden in their practicality and electability but unlike him in their relative youth and lack of baggage.
Buttigieg is smoother than Klobuchar and probably has more appeal to liberals and big donors, but Klobuchar has more political success under her belt and probably has more appeal to Obama-to-Trump voters. That makes the Minnesota senator the more compelling on-paper choice for Democrats who want electability and worry about Biden’s weaknesses: A Klobuchar-Booker ticket seems like where these Democrats should settle, if these things could be arranged through some purely pragmatic calculation.
They can’t be, though, and in particular there’s no party-decides arrangement that can induce the Biden coalition, durable across every debate so far, to fracture and then reform around someone who lacks his record, name recognition and credibility with party regulars. Nor is there a way to somehow combine strengths: Just as a Cruz-Rubio-Kasich chimera might have beaten Donald Trump in 2016, the strengths of Klobuchar and Buttigieg and Booker together could be formidable — but alone they each play to a much smaller base of support than do the consolidated front-runners.
And for Klobuchar and Buttigieg, race is a particular impediment: The moderate wing of the party is increasingly black and Hispanic rather than white and Midwestern, and neither candidate is well-positioned, in biography or record, to peel minority votes away from Biden. So both are stuck hoping to make Iowa their moment — a more reasonable hope for Buttigieg given his current polling numbers but not a completely vain one for Klobuchar.
The trouble is that their limitations mean that if either actually won Iowa, they could create the true free-for-all that the crowded debate stages promised — but they could also wound or cripple Biden without taking enough of his overall support to take his place, making the path to the nomination that much clearer for the candidates of the left.
Which, in turn, becomes another factor reinforcing the consolidation of the Democratic field. If you didn’t want Warren or Sanders a few months ago, it might have seemed too early to seriously consider anyone but Biden. But now, with Warren’s path seemingly opening, for the candidates presenting themselves as compelling Biden substitutes it might already be too late.

Questions swirl around NJ tax breaks

Texto completo: In 2017, the Economic Development Authority brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million.
New Jersey continues to probe potential conflicts of interest in the state's corporate tax break programs, and whether or not businesses misrepresented information in order to win millions of dollars from two recently expired programs now being investigated by federal and state authorities.
Audits and reports found that the state agency doling out billions of dollars in tax breaks to companies didn't have the processes in place to adequately vet applications and spot red flags, and raise questions about information companies certified as true in their applications and whether lobbyists registered with the state when required.
The agency granting the lucrative tax breaks, the Economic Development Authority, relies on fees from the applications to help boost the government body's budget, which is self-funded and doesn't rely on state appropriations. The fees get larger if an application is approved, which creates an unhealthy incentive and potential conflict of interest, according to lawyers on a task force created by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Part of that funding stream is the approval of applications that require diligence and require a gatekeeper," said task force special counsel Jim Walden at a hearing Thursday.
In 2017, the EDA brought in almost a third of its revenue from Grow NJ program fees, or $13.2 million. In previous years, the agency collected an average of 15% of its revenue from the program's fees.
If an application is approved, a company must pay 0.5% of the award up to $500,000, and again for when the tax break is actually issued. Companies then pay a service fee up to 2% of the tax credit up to $75,000. A company pays up to $5,000 to apply for a tax break.
Walden noted that the EDA underwriters he interviewed all said the fees did not cause them to approve an application, and they do not receive any bonuses for approvals.
The Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, which won a close to $80 million tax break to build a new practice facility in Camden, is the only company that included the fees it paid in its calculation that determined the size of its tax break.
"What happened is that the public paid for the EDA's fees," Walden said. "That money is money that the public was deprived of."
False statements Refrigeration distribution company Rainforest Distribution, which won a $2.4 million tax break in 2016, appeared to misrepresent information on its application to the Economic Development Authority, according to evidence presented Thursday at a hearing led by the task force.
The Queens-based company certified to the Economic Development Authority that it was considering moving to either Bayonne or Orangeburg, New York. In order to win a New Jersey tax break, a company has to prove it wouldn't move to New Jersey if it didn't have the tax break.
Emails between Rainforest Distribution employees and a consulting firm it hired, CBRE, suggest that Rainforest did not seriously plan on locating in Orangeburg.
Rainforest CEO Alexander Ridings, who was the CFO at the time the company submitted its application, admitted during Thursday's hearing the company had no serious intention of moving to Orangeburg. He said a commercial real estate firm the company hired, CBRE, asked for detailed information and reasons about why the New York site would also fit the company's needs.
Emails between CBRE and Rainforest employees show a CBRE employee named Susan Harte asking for a "lower cost option than NJ" and advised the company not to submit the draft lease Rainforest had from the Bayonne location. The company did not have a draft lease from Orangeburg. Harte asked Rainforest to submit a different document to the EDA "as it shows we are not so far along."
Ridings said he did not understand how this information would be used in Rainforest's application, and that it was the first time he was dealing with a commercial real estate firm and applying for a tax incentive. Special counsel Walden noted that Rainforest would have probably still been eligible for the tax break even if it just listed its previous location in Queens on its application.
"Effective October 16, 2019, Susan Harte, who previously served in our Location Incentives Group, is no longer employed by CBRE," CBRE said in a statement. "CBRE takes great pride in its reputation for upholding the highest ethical standards, which we demand from each of our 90,000 professionals around the globe."
Task force lawyers also read emails between Harte and EDA employees, and asked if the messages should be considered lobbying. Stephanie Olivo, the director of compliance with the state campaign finance agency, said yes. Harte does not appear to have registered with the agency.
"If special interests are not disclosed, there's the possibility the special interests are using illegal means to get their way," Walden said. Registering means "at least there's a breadcrumb trail."
The New York Times found that over five years, a dozen companies listed the same New York address at Blue Hill Plaza as the location they were considering moving to if they didn't win a New Jersey tax break.
The FBI and Philadelphia prosecutors are among a handful of entities investigating the two corporate tax break programs meant to boost job growth and development, Grow NJ and Economic Redevelopment & Growth (ERG), according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
A Senate panel is also considering replacement programs for Grow NJ and ERG, which expired earlier this year. An ethics committee dismissed a complaint filed by advocacy group Working Families earlier this week that alleged the committee was stacked with members with connections to insurance executive and power broker, George Norcross.
Norcross is tied to companies that won $1.1 billion of the $1.6 billion worth of tax breaks awarded in Camden, according to a ProPublica and WNYC investigation. The news outlets also found that lawyers from Parker McCay had an outsized role in the crafting of the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the revamped tax break programs. Parker McCay is led by Norcross' brother, Philip Norcross, and also represents many of the companies that won tax breaks.

Texto completo: The women at the foot of the U.S. Capitol wore a smattering of red Make America Great Again hats.
Herds of school kids passing by, in their matching field-trip T-shirts, threatened to outnumber the few hundred or so rallygoers, described by one blogger as an "ocean of MAGA caps."
Thursday's March for Trump, organized by Women for Trump, was more like a puddle.
But I wanted to mingle with these folks.
I wanted to hear from the women waving the big pink "Women for Trump" flags or wearing the "Women for Trump" hats. They are the WFTs. And though others may assemble those three letters differently when describing their movement, I wanted to hear why they remain die-hards in a dwindling minority.
Because there was no denying it: The crowd was tiny. I've covered 20 years of marches in Washington - from the World Bank protests at the turn of the century to 2017's ocean-of-pink Women's March - and this gathering was barely there.
Brittany Sechrist, 30, a stay-at-home mom, had traveled from Lebanon County, Penn., to support President Donald Trump.
"I like what he's doing," Sechrist said. She's been to other Trump rallies, but this one was important to her because she wants to stop the impeachment process.
I asked her why women should get behind Trump.
"Oh, for many, many reasons," she said.
And that was about all I could get.
But why?
I asked this again and again. I approached the women with the big signs and hats and goofy American-flag sunglasses. I asked the women in plain coats and sensible shoes. I wanted to hear from them all. Why would they support a serial adulterer who bragged about grabbing women's genitals and has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women?
Many women can't stomach Trump. A July Quinnipiac poll found that only 34 percent of women overall approved of the job Trump is doing, compared with 61 percent who disapproved.
In a Washington Post-Schar School poll taken this month, the gender gap is also wide when in comes to impeachment, with 65 percent of women saying they are in favor of the inquiry, compared with 51 percent of men.
The women on the Capitol lawn approving of him, for the most part, didn't want to talk to me once I introduced myself as a columnist with The Washington Post, which Trump calls the Amazon Washington Post in his disparaging tweets.
"Um, no thanks."
"I'm not interested."
"Are you kidding?"
Come on! I'm not even the "Failing New York Times."
The ones who would talk to me said the same things:
"I want him to know I am here for him."
"We are standing by him."
"He needs to know women are here."
Tammy Wynette lives on.
"This man does not have to do what he is doing," Amy Kremer, the organizer of the event, said when she took the podium. She said Trump could be living a life of luxury, traveling the world and golfing.
(Wait. Isn't that what he's doing? And we're the ones paying for it.)
As Kremer spoke, dozens of women whooped and cheered and hollered, clearly grateful that Trump has left his reality-TV show, his failed casinos, his failed university and all his bankruptcies to run the United States.
But why, specifically, is he good for American women, I wanted to know.
Was there a woman who believes the Equal Rights Amendment is an old idea that's no longer relevant? Or a woman who believes it was Melania Trump who brought family values and Christmas back to the White House? Or a military mom who is so glad funding for military child care will instead be used to build the wall?
Maybe, because we're face-to-face and not anonymous and online, I could get to the bottom of this.
But in most cases (except for Sechrist - thank you for your civility), when I asked the women they responded with an attack on the media or the elected officials running the impeachment inquiry. They didn't need online anonymity to make their judgments, even though most of them didn't want to give me their names.
Same with the speakers, who talked about the deep state, conspiracy theories and - don't worry, they didn't forget - Hillary Clinton's emails.
Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., was greeted like a hero when he took the podium and speculated that Clinton's server could be "at the bottom of the Potomac."
Each of the speakers looked upon the small crowd and marveled at its spirit.
The rally's size, though?
"There would be a lot more of us here if that didn't happen," a woman who drove in from Chantilly, Virginia, told me.
What happened? A conspiracy, natch.
Organizers said bus companies across the nation canceled the buses hired to bring supporters to the nation's capital.
"We feel this was done intentionally and will be issuing a statement at a later time," Kremer said in a statement posted on the March for Trump's Facebook page.
From bus stations in Pennsylvania to a Walmart parking lot in North Carolina, Trump supporters said they were left in the cold and dark early Thursday, waiting for buses that didn't show up.
The president they think they have - a man who will unite our country and treat everyone with respect - he hasn't shown up, either.

Texto completo: It was remembered as Rudy Giuliani's finest moment.
It was the afternoon of Sept. 11, 2001. The twin towers were gone. Thousands dead, many thousands more presumed killed. The United States, and New York City in particular, was gripped with fear.
Giuliani, in the final months of his eight years as mayor of New York City, was discussing the attacks at a news conference. All eyes in the nation, maybe the world, were on him.
"The city's going to survive, we're going to get through it," said the grim-faced mayor. "It's going to be a very, very difficult time. I don't think we yet know the pain we're going to feel when we find out who we lost. But the thing we have to focus on now is getting the city through this and surviving and being stronger for it."
Eighteen years later, Giuliani was in a very different mode as he embarked on a media blitz to defend President Donald Trump amid the escalating Ukraine scandal. The former mayor accused Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts of providing "distorted" coverage and called former Vice President Joe Biden "Slimy Joe." He performed a mock impersonation of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.. He sparred with liberal radio host Christopher Hahn on Laura Ingraham's Fox TV show.
"Shut up, moron. Shut up. Shut up," Giuliani told Hahn. "You don't know what you're talking about, idiot."
To some who have known him for decades, that's the same Giuliani they remember.
"He was always a malicious f---," said Fernando Ferrer, the borough president of the Bronx from 1987 to 2001.
But to many others, the Rudy Giuliani of the Donald Trump era — first as a campaign surrogate and now as the president's personal attorney and investigator — has been far from the calm and measured figure who helped lead the nation through the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He has embraced the president's "witch hunt" language and been widely mocked for his erratic and sometimes contradictory television appearances.
His aggressive defense of Trump in the face of impeachment has left many Americans, including some of his own former campaign and mayoral staff, wondering how "America's Mayor" has gambled his legacy to serve as an attack dog for a deeply unpopular president and push a widely discredited claim that has become the focus of a House impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani's role as Trump's arch-defender has also raised questions about the business dealings of a man who once pleaded poverty but since entering private life has amassed millions through speeches, security and legal services and, according to reports, relationships with Russian oligarchs, Ukrainian investors and the Qatari government.
Now Giuliani, once known as a corruption-busting prosecutor who brought down mob figures, is being investigated for his overseas business dealings by the Southern District of New York, the office he once commanded. Two Ukrainian-born associates of Giuliani's, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were indicted last week on charges of funneling foreign campaign contributions to a Super PAC supporting Trump.
Parnas and Fruman also helped connect Giuliani with figures in Ukraine in his quest to dig up dirt on Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to multiple reports.
Giuliani, who could not be reached for comment, was not charged and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Giuliani seen as both great defender and 'conspiracy nut' Reactions from Giuliani's former associates about his new role as Trump's defender-in-chief run the gamut from dismay to full-throated support. Giuliani has squandered the sense of goodwill he engendered after he led the city following the 9/11 attacks, one camp says. The other says the ex-mayor is doing the job the media won't: exposing corruption among Democrats and revealing that the years-long investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential race was a witch hunt targeting Trump.
"He's not doing anything that he hasn't done his whole career," said longtime Giuliani ally and former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik, who in 2010 was sentenced to four years in federal prison after admitting he used his position to get a company to pay for renovations of his home. "He's very aggressive. He's a very smart attorney. He is defending his client the best way he sees fit. If I was in the president's position, I wouldn't want anyone else in that position over him."
Walter Mack is an attorney who worked under Giuliani in the U.S. attorney's office as chief of its organized crime unit, and later as a deputy police commissioner during Giuliani's first term as mayor. Giuliani ousted him from both jobs. Giuliani canned him the first time after Mack openly criticized him for seeking too much publicity, which The Village Voice's Tom Robbins in 2006 compared to "trying to tell Donald Trump to stay out of tabloid gossip columns."
Giuliani's mayoral predecessor, David Dinkins, hired Mack as deputy police commissioner in 1994, a gig he lost one year into Giuliani's mayoralty. Mack still remembers being dispatched twice, but said he's not going to criticize his former boss.
"I think he's taken some risks but you do that as a defense lawyer for a client," Mack said. "You take risks if you think it's going to serve your client's interests ... His job is to defend the president."
Ken Frydman counts himself among the former Giuliani associates who is now appalled at his behavior. Frydman, press secretary for Giuliani's 1993 mayoral bid, went public with his disenchantment in an Oct. 7 op-ed in The New York Times criticizing Giuliani's defense of Trump.
Giuliani "cleaned up the city" and made it safer, creating a legacy that is at risk now because of his representation of Trump, Frydman said. In his media appearances defending the president, Frydman said, Giuliani is not acting like the mayor he knew.
"He sounded like Trump and he looks like a right-wing conspiracy nut. He's shuffling papers and he's screaming and he's yelling," Frydman said in an interview. "The guy I worked with was measured and a master of message control and discipline."
Mack, while defending Giuliani, echoed Frydman's thoughts on how Giuliani appears when he's defending the president on Fox News. If he ran into Giuliani today, Mack said, he'd ask him whether he's OK.
"I'm concerned about him," Mack said. "I think some people are worried about whether he's too much into this."
Kerik brushed aside any worries about Giuliani's state of mind.
"I know Ken thinks he's lost his f---ing mind," Kerik said. "But in reality, as somebody that's talked to him regularly, I probably talk to him every other day, I don't see anything different about him other than the fact that he's much more vocal today."
A 'mean man' Giuliani, who made headlines as a mob-busting, tough-on-Wall Street prosecutor after he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1983, captured New York City Hall in 1993 by ousting Dinkins (who had defeated Giuliani four years prior). He was the first Republican elected mayor of the city in nearly 30 years.
Democrats who dealt with him during his mayoral term do not share Frydman's sentiment that Giuliani has changed since his days at Gracie Mansion.
Council members who served during Giuliani's reign say they are flummoxed by this idea that the Giuliani they see on Fox News defending Trump is a different Giuliani than once led New York City.
"Rudy's a mean man," said Sal Albanese, a Brooklyn councilman for 16 years. "He's been a mean man, unethical man, a liar, his entire career."
Albanese and Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president ticked off a list of controversies they said show Giuliani's true character: falsely alleging a youth commissioner appointed by his predecessor of a crime; hiring the unqualified son of a political buddy to run the city's Housing Development Corporation; myriad divisive comments about the city's black community; and hiring Kerik.
Albanese acknowledged Giuliani seems "more unhinged" now, but said the Rudy he sees on Fox News is the same Rudy he tussled with at New York City Hall.
"His core is still there," he said. "The ends justify the means, authoritarian streak, constantly lying, distorting, dissembling — that was always there. And unfortunately, he's got Trump's ear."
Ruth Messinger is the former Manhattan Borough Council President who unsuccessfully challenged Giuliani in the 1997 mayor's race. Messinger said Giuliani's former associates who see a change in him now remember his corruption-busting early days as mayor, and his steady leadership in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, but not much in between. From the last year of his first term through his second, Messinger said, Giuliani did not use his political skills for the good of New Yorkers.
"The idea of a crusader, somebody against corruption, somebody who's determined to shake things up and produce results, was not a throughline for his years as mayor," Messinger said.
National spotlight after 9/11 Giuliani, who won his first mayoral race in 1993 in a squeaker then won re-election by a wide margin, saw his popularity dip toward the end of his second term as mayor. In 1998, a New York Times/CBS News poll said nearly two-thirds of New York City voters approved of Giuliani's job performance. By April 2000, his job approval dropped to 45% in the same poll.
The 9/11 attacks brought Giuliani national recognition and he saw his approval rating skyrocket. He became a national star, and for a while he was the front-runner to win the Republican nomination for president in 2008, leading John McCain by 17 points in a November 2007 Wall Street Journal poll.
But his campaign to win The White House was a disaster, with Giuliani conceding the important early-voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire to focus instead on winning Florida. He finished third there and ended his campaign.
His popularity has flipped since his high point after the Sept. 11 attacks, when 61% of people polled by NBC and the Wall Street Journal viewed him as "very positive." Now just 12% view him as "very positive," according to the poll.
Frydman described Giuliani as a "Diet Coke and pizza guy" when he worked for him. But since leaving office, he has been much more indulgent.
In 2001, in the middle of his divorce from Donna Hanover, Giuliani claimed through a lawyer that he had just $7,000 in assets. His wealth has grown considerably since then. This summer, legal proceedings for Giuliani's third divorce, from Judith Giuliani, revealed he spent $7,131 on fountain pens alone, according to the New York Times.
Giuliani's rise from the financial ashes was fueled by his post-mayoral consulting firm and his highly lucrative speech-giving gigs. Between January 2006 and February 2017, he earned $9.2 million from those gigs, according to the financial disclosure form he filed in advance of his ultimately failed 2008 presidential bid.
In May 2006 alone, he made $1.3 million total from 20 speeches to the City of Winnipeg, Shore Memorial Health Foundation, Merrill Lynch & Co. and more.
Giuliani owns or co-owns numerous luxury properties in New York and Florida.
He purchased a 10th floor apartment on East 66th Street for $4.77 million in 2002, the year before he married Judith. The couple spent $3.2 million in 2004 to build a mansion in Southampton, property records show. The four-bedroom home overlooks the Southampton Hunt & Polo Club.
Their two Palm Beach homes are a few miles from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club. The Giulianis bought a two-bedroom condo at Palm Beach Towers for $410,000 in 2004 and a two-bedroom condo on South Lake Street Drive set them back $1.4 million in 2010.
The Lake Street Drive condo is on the market for $3 million.
At 75 years old, Giuliani is most likely in his final act in public life. It may be his biggest and, depending on how the impeachment inquiry turns out, could overshadow his achievements as mayor. But he is most likely to have his legacy tied to Trump, said Fred Siegel, a former political adviser to Giuliani who wrote about him, "The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York, and the Genius of American Life."
"The other things are there — the reduction in crime, the reduction in welfare, his achievements as a prosecutor. But this is a whole other ball of wax, to use a tired expression. The whole future of the country is on the line," said Siegel, now a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. "It's hard to imagine it's not going to have profound impact on how we see him down the road."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan to keep a small contingent of US troops in eastern Syria, perhaps numbering about 200, to combat the Islamic State group and block the advance of Syrian government and Russian forces into the region's coveted oil fields, a senior administration official said Sunday.
If Trump approves the proposal to leave a couple of hundred Special Operations forces in eastern Syria, it would mark the second time in 10 months that he has revised his order to pull out nearly all US troops from the country. In December, Trump directed 2,000 US troops to leave Syria immediately, only to relent later and approve a more gradual withdrawal.
The potential development came as Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria withdrew from a flashpoint town as part of a cease-fire agreement with Turkey, a spokesman said Sunday, a move that could ease tensions amid US-led efforts to quell a spiraling conflict.
Despite the truce, sporadic clashes between the SDF and Turkish forces and their proxies continued in Ras al-Ain, on the border with Turkey. Under the deal, Turkish forces would halt military operations for 120 hours to allow the SDF to retreat.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in Kabul Sunday, said the cease-fire in northeastern Syria "generally seems to be holding," despite reports of "intermittent fire." He said the US withdrawal was proceeding as planned.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to resume a military offensive in northeastern Syria if Kurdish fighters didn't retreat from designated border areas by Tuesday evening, the deadline in the cease-fire pact.
A spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, said they were keeping their end of the deal. “As part of the agreement to pause military operations with Turkey . . . today, we have evacuated the city of Ras al-Ain," spokesman Kino Gabriel said. "We don't have any more fighters in the city."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, led a surprise congressional visit to neighboring Jordan over the weekend, highlighting her sharp disagreement with Trump's decision to remove US troops from northern Syria and Turkey's subsequent attacks on Kurdish enclaves.
Pelosi met with King Abdullah II and senior Jordanian officials Saturday night. Neither country released details of the talks until after the delegation departed for the United States on Sunday morning.
"With the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey's incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran, and Russia," Pelosi said.
Pelosi earlier called the cease-fire deal "a sham" that gave a pass to Turkey's offensive at the expense of the Kurds, a key ally in the fight against the Islamic State in Syria.
Abdullah "urged a political solution that safeguards Syria's territorial integrity and the unity of its people, while guaranteeing the safe and voluntary return of refugees," according to the state-run Petra news agency.
Coverage of Pelosi's "middle of the night" meetings in the Jordanian press focused largely on concerns that Turkey's assault would result in the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters, many of them from Jordan, from Syrian prisons.
In Washington, Trump has come under withering criticism from former military commanders, Democrats, and even some of his staunchest Republican allies for pulling back US troops.
A senior administration official said Sunday that Trump has since last week been considering a plan to leave a couple of hundred troops in northeast Syria, near the border with Iraq, for counterterrorism efforts. The official said it is a concept Trump favors.
Three other administration and Defense Department officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential military planning, confirmed over the weekend that the option was being discussed among top US policy makers and commanders.

The senior administration official said it was highly likely that troops would be kept along the Iraqi border area — away from the cease-fire zone that Vice President Mike Pence negotiated with Erdogan last week. The main goal would be to prevent the Islamic State group from reestablishing all or parts of its religious state, or caliphate, in Syria and neighboring Iraq.
A side benefit would be helping the Kurds keep control of oil fields in the east, the official said.
Trump seemed to hint at this outcome in a message on Twitter on Sunday, saying, “We have secured the Oil."
The senior administration official suggested that the president was balancing competing impulses: achieving the ultimate goal of bringing US forces home from Syria — part of a signature campaign promise to pull US troops from “endless wars" — and ensuring that efforts to contain and diminish ISIS continue. The order also could be heard as at least a partial answer to those who have criticized the president's policy.

Texto completo: Two days before ExxonMobil goes to court Wednesday, facing New York state accusations the oil company misled investors about climate change, a team of researchers released a report Monday outlining the company and the broader fossil fuel industry's decades-long campaign of deception, and its success at confusing the American public.
The report, which was published by scientists at Harvard, George Mason and Bristol universities, draws parallels between the campaigns launched by tobacco companies and oil industries to mislead the public about their products, both with a goal of delaying government policies and regulations that could cut into their profits.
Revelations about ExxonMobil's campaign came from 2015 reports in the Los Angeles Times and Inside Climate News, and studies previous to Monday's have documented its efforts to manipulate public opinion.

ExxonMobil has previously dismissed such research as the work of anti-oil activists. But on Wednesday, New York's lawsuit, alleging the company mislead investors, is set to go to trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
"For 60 years, the fossil fuel industry has known about the potential global warming dangers of their products. But instead of warning the public or doing something about it, they turned around and orchestrated a massive campaign of denial and delay designed to protect profits," said Geoffrey Supan, a researcher in the department of the history of science at Harvard. "The evidence is incontrovertible: Exxon misled the public."
The authors highlight the tactics used by the campaigns, including trotting out fake experts, promoting conspiracy theories and cherry-picking evidence. And they point to specific examples employed by ExxonMobil, including a 2004 New York Times advertisement that read like an editorial. It employed traditional disinformation techniques such as questioning scientific consensus and advocating for a "balanced" scientific approach to climate change, giving weight to those skeptical of the prevailing research.
The report suggests that although the disinformation campaign was successful in confusing the public and slowing a government response to a danger oil company scientists had identified as far back as the 1970s, such campaigns can be stopped.
Educating the public about the techniques used by these campaigns can "neutralize and inoculate the public against disinformation," said John Cook, an assistant professor of communications at George Mason University and lead author of the report.
Recent polls show a growing number of Americans believe that climate change is occurring and that it is the result of human activity.
On Oct. 10, Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Maura Healy sent a notice to ExxonMobil of her office's intent to sue in civil court -- for violating the state's Consumer Protection Act -- "by engaging in unfair or deceptive acts" regarding the sale and branding of fossil fuel products.
ExxonMobil's lawyers are crying foul and have asked the Superior Court of Massachusetts' Suffolk County to slow down Healy's team -- at least until the New York trial has come to an end.
"It appears your office has decided to charge the company without any consideration or concern for the underlying facts," wrote ExxonMobil's counsel, Theodore V. Wells Jr., in a letter dated Oct. 14. Instead, Wells said, the lawsuit seems purposefully timed to interfere with the New York trial.
"The timing of your notice provides further cause for concern that improper motives animate your office's decision to file suit," he wrote, suggesting it provided "the freshest evidence of your office's participation in a conspiracy with other state attorneys general."
Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for the company, said the New York and Massachusetts lawsuits were "politically motivated and resulted from a coordinated effort by anti-fossil fuel groups and contingency-fee lawyers involved in other lawsuits against industry."
He added that "ExxonMobil believes that climate change risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us -- business, governments and consumers -- to make meaningful progress."

Dreaming of a blue Ohio

Texto completo: Democrats made much out of choosing the middle of Ohio as the site for the latest presidential primary debate.

Ohio is still a battleground, not a solidly red state, they say. Columbus suburbs like Westerville are turning blue, they say. The 2020 Democratic contenders have messages that will resonate with Ohio voters, they say.

But how much did the dozen Democratic presidential hopefuls on the stage at Otterbein University last week really offer Ohioans?

The audience heard a little about Ohio. That General Motors was once, but no longer is, the state's top employer. That each year between 2010 and 2014 there were more opioid prescriptions written in Ohio than there were people in the state. That Pete Buttigieg drives an Ohio-made Chevy Cruze.

And candidates were eager to repeat Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown's catch phrase the dignity of work, a theme he briefly tested as he considered joining the crowded primary field this year.

Several candidates, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro, and former Texas U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, endorsed plans to hold pharmaceutical companies financially responsible for the opioid epidemic, which is ravaging Ohio even worse than most other states.

State and local elected leaders in Ohio are already suing drug makers, however. Favorable initial rulings in other states make the prospects of upcoming Ohio trials look promising. So, what else do the presidential hopefuls have to offer states like Ohio that will still be badly in need of treatment centers and other resources, even after the court cases?

And nearly every candidate decried bad trade deals that have cut a swath of destruction across Ohio's jobs' landscape. The candidates were short on details, however, about how they might rectify the damage done by decades of NAFTA and other trade pacts that left Ohio workers at a disadvantage.

And not once during the latest debate did the field discuss the toxic algae crisis threatening Lake Erie, though that was as much the fault of the CNN/New York Times panel of questioners as it was the candidates'.

The Democratic theory that suburbs like Westerville - once a solid Republican stronghold - are ripe for Democratic pick-up in 2020 seems plausible.

Republicans perhaps took the Franklin County community - which Barack Obama never won - for granted for many years. In 2016, however, the GOP hold began to slip as Hillary Clinton narrowly won Westerville even as Republicans Sen. Rob Portman and U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi also won the city in their races that year. In 2018, however, Democrats swept Westerville.

But turning the whole state blue next year is going to take more than tossing out a few Buckeye state factoids from an Ohio college debate stage.

Democratic candidates serious about winning Ohio are going to need to offer solid specific answers to Ohio's issues.

Texto completo: Monday was Columbus Day, a federal holiday since 1937.
But it's been under fire for years by native American groups who say that not only did Columbus not discover America -- because their ancestors were already here -- but that he opened the door to brutalizing their ancestors.
In New Mexico this year, they changed the name of the holiday to Indigenous Peoples' Day.
But State Sen. William E. Sharer, a New Mexico Republican, called the new holiday a "slap at Americans. All Americans."
Another wedge issue had been found.
"There's no reason to turn it into an anti-American holiday," Sharer told Stateline.
Maine and Vermont also observed Indigenous Peoples' Day this year, the publication said.
A poll by College Pulse, a polling company that focuses on college students, found that 70% of students are in favor of changing the day to honor native Americans instead.
But, Stateline said, a 2017 Rasmussen Reports poll found that 58% of adults want to keep Columbus Day.
The report said that South Dakota was the first state to rename Columbus Day in 1990.
And Alaska followed in 2017.
That makes five states.
More than a hundred cities and counties, as well as many universities, have also renamed the holiday, according to The New York Times.
Hawaii in 1988 passed a law to observe Discoverers' Day on the second Monday in October in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers of the Hawaiian Islands, Stateline said.
It said, "Columbus Day has its roots in efforts to destigmatize Italian Americans when they were discriminated against as an immigrant group."
Instead of arguing about the holiday, why not just drop it?
I mean, really, does anyone but government workers even get the day off?
Just erase it from the list of national holidays and be done with it.
After all, Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, supposedly landed in Canada nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean.

Texto completo: Kind of gas or of good blood?
Electron group or mollusk covering?
Alkaline or simple?
If you're puzzled, that's actually the point. These questions are clues that appear in the latest crossword puzzle created by Robert Pike, an inorganic chemistry professor at the College of William and Mary.
Pike's puzzles have run in his department alumni newsletter for more than a decade. Now several are set to appear in a Chicago-based regional newsletter of the American Chemical Society (ACS).
"I've always loved them - they're just fun to do," Pike said. "They help your lateral thinking skills, so that you're always thinking about what words mean, and not always in the most obvious sense ... Crosswords help bring out the linguistic subtlety that makes language rich and fun."
The answers to the three clues listed above are prime examples of his latest puzzle's theme of double meanings: noble, shell, basic.
But, lest nonchemists be leery to tackle one of Pike's crosswords, chemistry plays only a small part. Most clues and their answers are far more general, as in "Kind of duck (teal)," "Portray as the bad guy (demonize)," and "Vader to his friends (Darth)."
Margaret E. Schott, William and Mary alumna and new editor of The Chemical Bulletin of the ACS, said she believes Pike's puzzles will help her re-energize the monthly publication, which has been around since 1914.
"I am adding more color, a new layout, original articles," Schott said. "Giving it a makeover or face-lift, if you will."
The crosswords and other new features will engage readers by injecting a spirit of levity that's appealing to chemists and aspiring chemists across age groups, she said. The bulletin reaches about 4,000 society members, including students, educators and government and industry researchers.
A puzzle aficionado, Pike simply decided one day a dozen years ago to try his hand at making one. He liked his first effort and shipped it off to The New York Times.
"They rejected it - no surprise," Pike recalled. "But then I thought, well ... I've got a captive audience insofar as our department sends a newsletter out to alumni every year, and that's several hundred people ... And the rest was history."
Crafting a crossword is laborious. In early summer, he starts with a theme, then writes down tons of words to fit that theme. He matches up words by length, making sure they go together with no "bad letters in bad places" or dead ends. He blocks off spaces so that each puzzle is rotationally symmetrical. Finally, he writes up the clues, trying to hit that sweet spot between too obscure and too easy. It can take about 15 hours over a span of a week or two to get it just right.
When a puzzle is ready, he'll beta test it over the summer on colleagues in the department and his own research students "whether they like it or not," Pike said. If it looks good, he'll spread even more copies around the department to let other summer students have a shot.
"Some of them clearly enjoy it," said Pike. "And others, it's not really their thing. But William and Mary students are sharp students. It's not surprising that there are plenty of them that like something as mentally stimulating as a crossword puzzle."
A University of Wisconsin study published in The Journal of Effective Teaching in 2009 claimed that crossword puzzles are very effective at helping some students learn, especially when preparing for exams.
Gifted and talented students prefer games and other alternative teaching methods, and crosswords are "effective teaching tools of terminology, definitions, spelling and pairing key concepts with related names, resulting in greater retention and memorization of facts," the study states.
But researchers cautioned that not all students in their study benefited, and more study was needed to understand exactly why.
Pike, for one, doesn't incorporate his crosswords into his classes.
"We have some heavy stuff to cover and I'm a fairly old-school lecturer," Pike said. "I don't know how much I'd enjoy that."
After 11 puzzles over 11 years, he said has no intention of stopping.
"I don't want to drop that," Pike said. "I'm hoping the alumni look forward to their newsletters at least in part to try the puzzle. I'm hoping there are some of them that really look forward to that. And I wouldn't want to let them down - these imaginary people that I dreamed up."

Thinking clearly about Trump and aid to Ukraine

Texto completo: There's been a lot of confusion about what, exactly, were President Trump's concerns before withholding and later approving U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, made a hash of things during his much-discussed press conference on Thursday. Media coverage of Mulvaney's appearance just made things worse. So now, some clarification.
In various statements, the president or top aides have listed five reasons for his concern about U.S. aid to Ukraine:
1) Trump's general dislike of foreign aid. "President Trump is not a big fan of foreign aid," Mulvaney said Thursday. "Never has been; still isn't. Doesn't like spending money overseas, especially when it's poorly spent."
Starting with his campaign and continuing from his first budget, Trump has proposed cutting U.S. foreign aid. Entirely apart from the Ukraine matter, Trump has on a number of occasions taken steps to block or slow the delivery of U.S. aid to a number of nations.
For example, in August 2018, the Office of Management and Budget directed the State Department to make a list of roughly $3 billion in foreign aid that had not yet been spent. The White House idea was to block the spending until the end of that fiscal year, September 30, 2018, and then return it to the U.S. Treasury. But it took just a few weeks for the White House to back off its plan in the face of congressional opposition. This August, the Office of Management and Budget did the same thing, with the same result -- except for Ukraine.
2) Trump's concern that other countries do not contribute enough to foreign aid. This, again, is a point Trump has made many times, starting with his campaign and throughout his presidency. It was his main critique of NATO, and it is a concern that extends to Ukraine.
"We do a lot for Ukraine," Trump told President Volodymyr Zelensky in the infamous July 25 phone conversation that started the Ukraine matter. "We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's something that you should really ask them about."
While not fully accurate -- Trump was wrong that other countries give little aid to Ukraine but right that they give little lethal military aid -- the Zelensky conversation was a concise statement of Trump's attitude.
3) Trump's general concern about corruption in Ukraine. The president believes Ukraine has a big corruption problem, and in that view, Trump is in line with previous administrations and the rest of the world. Trump would be unique if he did not think corruption was a major problem in Ukraine. "There is a long history of corruption and of basically Ukraine oligarchs getting their way in the Ukrainian system," a senior Obama administration official, reflecting a widely-held view, said before one of then-Vice President Joe Biden's trips to Ukraine in December 2015.
There is also, of course, a long history of nations, including the United States, attaching anti-corruption conditions to aid to Ukraine. During a now-famous appearance in 2018, Biden recounted a March 2016 visit to Ukraine in which he insisted the government fire prosecutor general Viktor Shokin before receiving $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees. "I said, 'You're not getting the billion,'" Biden recalled. "I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money."
"Well, son of a bitch," Biden said, delivering the punch line: "He got fired." Another condition successfully attached to U.S. aid to Ukraine.
4) Trump's desire to see Ukraine assist in a probe of the Russia-2016 campaign investigation. To some readers, the most baffling portion of the Trump-Zelensky rough transcript was when Trump said, "Our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation."
It turned out that Trump was curious about a theory -- one which appears to have no basis in fact -- that someone in Ukraine somehow possesses the Democratic National Committee server that was hacked in 2016 and which the DNC did not let investigators examine. But there is a larger issue in what Trump said, and that is the ongoing Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. It's publicly known that John Durham, the U.S. attorney chosen by attorney general William Barr to conduct the investigation, has been in contact with a number of foreign countries, including Ukraine, as part of the investigation. Trump has also heard from some Republicans that some Ukrainian officials had information to offer U.S. investigators. So he wanted Ukrainian assistance.
5) Trump's desire to see Ukraine investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden's son Hunter. The final part of the president's view of foreign aid to Ukraine was his belief that the elder Biden, when he was vice president, might have corruptly pressed the Ukrainians to fire a prosecutor -- see above -- to spare Hunter Biden, who had a suspiciously lucrative deal with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great," Trump told Zelensky in the phone call. "Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me."
So there they are -- the five reasons behind Trump's action on Ukraine. The first three are not only entirely legitimate but unremarkable. But there has been considerable controversy -- and confusion -- about the last two.
Trump's desire to see Ukraine assist in the 2016 "investigation of the investigation" was entirely reasonable. Mulvaney referred to "whether or not [Ukraine was] cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our Department of Justice -- that's completely legitimate." In fact, some part of the U.S. government has been investigating the 2016 election since at least mid-2016. There is still an investigation going on -- Durham's -- and it would not be unusual for the the government to want Ukraine to cooperate. After all, Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation sought and received the cooperation of several foreign countries. Investigating 2016 is something that has been standard procedure for the last few years.
It is the final reason -- Trump's desire to see Ukraine investigate the Bidens -- that set off the Ukraine affair. It differs fundamentally from the other four in that it would involve an investigation of a current political rival of the president. While a few Republicans and commentators have sought to defend Trump's request, others have suggested that the president should admit that it was improper but argue that it was simply not bad enough to warrant impeachment. "A truthful and sound defense," National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote recently, "would give ground on the impropriety of the focus on the Bidens, but emphasize that nothing came from any pressure campaign, which was quickly abandoned."
One fact that has gotten lost in the Mulvaney controversy is that the chief of staff clearly said Trump held up aid to Ukraine in part because he, Trump, wanted Ukraine to assist in the Durham investigation. At the same time, Mulvaney just as clearly denied that investigating the Bidens played any role in Trump's decision to withhold aid.
Some press coverage conflated the two and reported that Mulvaney had admitted Trump held up the aid while demanding Ukraine "investigate Democrats." Mulvaney, the New York Times said, "told reporters that military aid was held back in part to prod Ukraine to investigate Democrats." The Washington Post reported that Mulvaney admitted "that Trump withheld aid meant for Ukraine to push the government there to investigate Democrats." But that is not what Mulvaney said at all. Investigating the roots of the Trump-Russia investigation is not "investigating Democrats." It is investigating the actions of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies during the 2016 campaign. Holding back aid to force Ukraine to investigate the Bidens would be "investigating Democrats," but Mulvaney specifically denied that Trump did that.
So the story is more complicated than some press coverage suggests. Four of Trump's reasons for withholding aid were legitimate. The fifth was not. But the fact remains that the president had acceptable reasons to temporarily hold back aid. There's more to the story than just Trump's fifth reason. And on that, perhaps the president should just take Rich Lowry's advice and move on.

Texto completo: Coming up just might be the most invigorating week of the year for music lovers. Think I'm exaggerating? What if I told you that Central Floridians will have the chance to hear the following:
A touring vibraphonist - that's a musician who plays that jazzy, struck-with-mallets, percussive keyboard instrument; a unique collaboration of composers and dancers; an award-winning Armenian pianist; arguably the best-known opening chord progression in the history of music; and nothing less than the creation of the universe.
Let's look at these myriad events chronologically.
On Sunday, Oct. 20, the Bach Festival Society's touring-artist series presents Sergei Babayan. Born in Armenia while it was part of the Soviet Union, Babayan studied at the Moscow Conservatory. In 1996, he founded the Sergei Babayan International Piano Academy at the Cleveland Institute of Music, where he is artist-in-residence.
For his Central Florida appearance, he'll play music by Chopin, J.S. Bach and Jean-Philippe Rameau. (3 p.m. Oct. 20; Rollins College, 1000 Holt Ave. in Winter Park; bachfestivalflorida.org).
Now jump ahead to Oct. 26, and get jazzy. Chris Dingman, virtuoso vibraphonist, will bring his jazzy sound to Orlando. Admit it: You're curious about a concert in which the vibraphone is the star attraction, right? Dingman has won praise around the world - called "dazzling" in The New York Times - for his distinctive approach to the instrument, with which he creates emotionally rich soundscapes. (7:30 p.m. Oct. 26; Timucua Arts Foundation, 2000 S. Summerlin Ave. in Orlando; timucua.com).
Also opening the 26th, the Bach Festival Society will present Haydn's "Creation" with full choir and orchestra joined by vocal soloists Anthony Ciaramitaro, Kevin Deas and Clara Rottsolk. John Sinclair conducts the masterwork, which travels from the chaos at the dawn of time through Adam and Eve's idyllic life in the Garden of Eden and beyond. (7:30 p.m. Oct. 26, 3 p.m. Oct. 27; Rollins College, 1000 Holt Ave. in Winter Park; bachfestivalflorida.org).
And there's a third option for the night of the 26th: The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra will play Beethoven's Fifth. You know the one - starts off with those dramatic and slightly ominous chords: da-da-da duhhh, then repeats the rhythm with even lower notes: da-da-da duhhh.
Guest conductor Rei Hotoda will take the podium for the program, which also includes Barber's Violin Concerto featuring soloist Rimma Bergeron-Langlois. (8 p.m. Oct 26; Bob Carr Theater, 401 W. Livingston St. in Orlando; orlandophil.org).
Finally, the 27th brings "Transcend: Movement Meets Music" in which the Central Florida Composers Forum teams with Emotions Dance to interpret their works.
Known as CF2, the composers forum promotes the development of new music locally. This is the first time the group has teamed with a dance company on such a program. As connecting with the community is part of the mission, those who attend are encouraged to bring food, wine or other drink to share with other audience members in this evening of exploring new music and the dancers' interpretation of it. (7:30 p.m. Oct. 27; Timucua Arts Foundation, 2000 S. Summerlin Ave. in Orlando; timucua.com).

Can we stop talking about Medicare for All? The debate over what type of insurance system America should have eclipses discussion of other important policy matters.

Texto completo: At Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, talking about health care pretty much meant talking about "Medicare for All" - again. The controversial idea of abolishing private insurance in favor of a single, government-run program certainly deserves some rigorous back-and-forth. But not at the expense of issues with a much greater impact on our health.
As an emergency physician, I can tell you that the best health insurance in the world means nothing if patients can't reach a hospital in their moment of need. But more than 100 hospitals in rural areas have closed since 2010, and hundreds more are at risk. When hospitals close, ambulance times can increase dramatically, and the additional wait often means the difference between life and death. Candidates, what do you think about that?
Many of the remaining hospitals have cut high-cost services such as obstetrics. Between 2004 and 2014, hospitals serving 179 rural counties stopped being able to care for pregnant women, directly resulting in increases in preterm births and births outside of hospitals. Today, fewer than half of rural counties have hospitals that provide obstetric care. When laboring women have to drive four hours to get to a hospital, it's not surprising that some deliver on the way and many women have to forgo prenatal care. Debate moderators, a question perhaps?
Health insurance also means nothing if there aren't enough doctors. In Texas, a span of 11,000 square miles is served by just one doctor. More than 60 percent of all U.S. counties - and 80 percent of rural counties - lack a single psychiatrist. Some 34 million Americans live in areas short on dental health professionals, and 19 million live in reproductive health care deserts, without access to providers of basic services such as contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Voters, isn't this something you want to know more about?
To be fair, multiple candidates have proposals for stabilizing rural hospitals, funding community health centers, protecting women's health care and incentivizing health professionals to work in underserved areas. But you wouldn't know it from the substance of the campaign so far. The American people need to hear more about these ideas on how - literally - to access care, which is a prerequisite to discussion of how to pay for it.
And beyond that, we need to hear that candidates understand people's everyday health concerns. In the urgent care clinic where I practice, patients routinely come to me with kidney damage and heart problems because of untreated high blood pressure. Even with insurance, they have to ration prescription medications. Two weeks ago, I treated a patient who cut her blood-pressure pills into halves, then quarters, before she stopped taking them altogether.
I know my patients would be eager to hear how those vying to be the next president would address their struggle to afford prescription drugs. Would they press Congress to allow the federal government to negotiate directly with drug companies? Would they use executive powers to force Big Pharma to cut prices of key life-sustaining medications, such as insulin for diabetes treatment and naloxone, the opioid antidote?
Speaking of the opioid epidemic, candidates must be hearing what I hear: the devastating toll that opioids wreak in rural and urban communities alike, compounded by the tragedy of limited treatment availability. Addiction is a disease for which treatment exists. Yet only 10 percent of Americans with addictions are getting the care they need. Imagine the outcry if only 10 percent of Americans who need chemotherapy were getting it.
Marc Lacey, national editor at The New York Times, did ask about the opioid crisis Tuesday. That's good. Many candidates have thoughtful proposals for addressing the crisis. Let's dig into this urgent, on-the-ground health care issue to the same degree we've analyzed the high-altitude pros and cons of Medicare for All. More than a hundred people die every day after overdosing on opioids. How will our next president save lives today?
Finally, we need to hear candidates talk about how to prevent illness in the first place. At the next debate, how refreshing would it be if someone answered a Medicare for All question with a quick pivot: "Let's talk about policies that keep people healthy instead." Prevent our children from getting lead-poisoned. Stop the release of pollutants that worsen asthma. Empower communities to provide healthy food options and walkable spaces. Invest in education, affordable housing and accessible transportation. All these things have as much of an effect on overall health as health care services themselves.
Sound health policy is about so much more than the mechanics of insurance. Let's stop letting Medicare for All dominate the conversation. The United States' patients - the voters - expect much more.

Texto completo: The course of a presidential investigation can sometimes hinge on a few words. For Bill Clinton, they were his assurances at a news conference that "I did not have sexual relations with that woman."
For Richard Nixon the words were, "All right. Fine," his agreement on the "smoking gun" tape to stop the FBI from investigating the Watergate break-in.
And Donald Trump's fate may rest on 10 words from the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky: "I would like you to do us a favor, though." We'll be picking that sentence apart for a long time to come; by the time this is over, we'll all know it by heart.

The main snag for Trump is that adverb, "though." Attached to the end of a sentence, "though" restricts or qualifies what was said previously. And when what precedes that sentence is a promise or offer, "though" signals a condition: "You can take the car tomorrow. You'll have to pick up the kids, though."
That's clearly the role "though" plays in the transcript. Zelensky says he's ready to buy more missiles from the U.S.; Trump responds with "I would like you to do a favor, though." If Trump hadn't wanted to connect the missile purchases to the favor, he wouldn't have used "though." He would have started the sentence with something like, "Oh, and another thing."
Then there's the weird way Trump couches his request as a "favor." That turns out to be just as much of a snag as "though" is. As a speech act, to ask for a favor is to request an act of personal kindness that benefits the requester: in this case, launching investigations that would benefit Trump rather than Ukraine. "Favor" is not the word you'd use to ask Ukraine to implement extensive structural reforms, as some Trump defenders have argued the president was doing. That would benefit Ukrainians rather than us. It would be like asking President Xi Jinping to do us a favor and hold free elections.
In any event, Zelensky had no choice in the matter. What Trump asked of Zelensky was a faux favor: a request made under the pretense that the addressee will fulfill it out of goodwill, when in fact rejecting it would come with a price. To many, Trump's request for a faux favor evoked the language of "The Godfather," a film in which the failure to grant a favor could have dire consequences. Calling it a "favor" follows a transparent fiction of the Godfather's world, that when people defer to the don, it's not out of fear or greed but respect. That's implicit in the movie's signature line, when Don Vito explains he is going to "make him an offer he can't refuse."
But the mobster analogy isn't entirely apt. As leaders go, Trump is no Vito Corleone. His narcissism gets in the way.
Asking for faux favors is endemic wherever there are asymmetries of wealth and power, particularly at higher altitudes, and the fiction isn't always as transparent as it was to the don. Jennifer Chatman, a professor of management at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, has studied the toxic effects on an organization of narcissistic leaders, particularly grandiose narcissists, who have an inflated sense of their intellect and allure and an unlimited appetite for praise. She points out that such a leader may think he's flattering his underlings by asking for favors rather than issuing orders. In doing so, he "allows them to breathe his rarified air" and gives them the gift of choice.
"Narcissists have a nose for patsies," Chatman observes, "ready to ingratiate at a moment's notice." It's another kind of quid pro quo: Do as I ask and you can bathe in my luster.
That's Trump to a T. He has boundless faith in his charisma. Long before he was president he was confident that his wealth and celebrity invested him with a glow that inclined others to want to please him and grant him favors of every kind (as he notoriously put it, "When you're a star..."). The journalist Seth Hettena noted in the New York Times last year that "'do me a favor' is one of [Trump's] favorite lines."
From the start of their conversation, Zelensky lavished on Trump the ardent praise he expects from everyone in range of his aura. So it was natural for Trump to suppose that Zelensky would be gratified by a request that implied a personal connection and the promise of Trump's gratitude. To Trump, all policy is personal, so he was surely pleased when Zelensky responded to his request for a faux favor by declaring Ukraine "open for any future cooperation" and raised the prospect of a future tete-a-tete and a ride in Trump's plane.
Is it any wonder he came away from the call calling it "a perfect conversation?"

Ranking Sheet Masks

Texto completo: We tested nine top-rated, best-selling options and have the answer for you.
Hydration is the only promise a sheet mask can keep, though even that might be a reach, according to Michelle Wong, a chemist who runs the skin care blog LabMuffin. Despite claims you might read on the packaging, "sheet masks will not cure anything," Ms. Wong said.
But that doesn't mean they are not pampering. Long popular in South Korea, sheet masks are no longer the stuff of specialty stores. Now you can grab them at Sephora, Urban Outfitters and even Trader Joe's. Or you could easily slather on a hyaluronic acid serum with your fingertips, but what is the fun in that?
Dr. Dendy Engelman, a Manhattan cosmetic dermatologist, is a fan. "I sheet mask all the time," she said. "At the office after a procedure, in the bathtub with my kids, I'll even pop on a sheet mask and some sunglasses before I get in my car. It's a cost-effective, painless beauty splurge to look forward to."
Sheet masks are single-use veils, most often fashioned out of paper or cotton, which are soaked in serum. They are not all created equal, though. Dr. Engelman and Ms. Wong recommend looking for masks containing glycerin, hyaluronic acid (sometimes listed in its salt form as sodium hyaluronate), or some combination of these ingredients. Both suggest skipping masks that contain drying alcohols, like ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, which are typically added to produce a cooling effect and are listed as ingredients.
To find sheet masks worth buying, we at Wirecutter (a product review site owned by The New York Times) tested nine top-rated, best-selling options containing glycerin, hyaluronic acid or their derivatives, and none had drying alcohols. We also tested an ultra-popular reusable silicone cover, which is meant to help more securely seal a sheet mask (or anything else applied beneath it) to your face.
We enlisted a panel of six intrepid reviewers -- four women and two men, each with varied face shapes and skin types -- who used all nine sheet masks over a period of three weeks. That's roughly one mask every two days. The panelists, who were unaware which masks they were testing because we had taped over the packaging beyond recognition, wore each option while lounging, working at their desks or, in the case of one busy parent, baking cupcakes. No one knew whether they were reviewing a $ 42 sheet mask (La Mer's The Hydrating Facial) or a $ 2 one (like Mediheal's N.M.F. Intensive Hydrating Mask). Apart from trying the various sheet masks, the panelists went about their skin care routines as usual.
For each mask, the reviewers rated on a 1 to 5 scale: the ease of application (how quickly they could get it on without making a mess); scent (how pleasant the serum smelled); staying power (whether the mask remained put or dried out quickly); and the postmask feel of their skin (just how good their face looked or felt). Note that because sheet masks are more about personal indulgence than skin transformation, we did not attempt to assess their efficacy.
The Competition
Of the nine we tested, seven couldn't quite match our top two. Panelists rated SK-II's Pitera Facial Treatment Mask ( $ 17) the best fitting over all, and liked the postmask feel of the pricey La Mer, but neither was rated highly enough to justify the cost compared to others we tested. The postmask feel of an inexpensive drugstore option, Neutrogena's Hydro Boost 100% Hydrogel Mask ( $ 3), scored as well as La Mer (it was, however, more prone to slippage). Testers said they would not buy the TONYMOLY I'm Aloe Sheet Mask ( $ 3), Sephora Collection Rose Moisturizing Face Mask ( $ 6) or Karuna Hydrating+ Face Mask ( $ 7) again. The Mediheal mask, too, earned middling scores.
Our Favorite Sheet Mask
Dr. Jart Hydration Lover Rubber Mask
Key ingredients: Glycerin, sodium hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid
Cost per mask: $ 12
Among the most Instagrammable sheet masks our panel tested, this "hydrogel" option from Dr. Jart stayed put and fit most panelists' faces well. Included with the mask, which one reviewer said made her look "like a cast member of the Blue Man Group," is a lightly scented face cream containing sodium hyaluronate, hyaluronic acid, plus additional glycerin. (You apply the cream before affixing the rubberlike mask.) "It was the only one I could sip coffee while wearing, and my skin felt nice after," said a reviewer with combination oily-dry skin.
Our Favorite Budget Mask
My Beauty Diary Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Face Mask
Key ingredients: Glycerin, sodium hyaluronate
Cost per mask: $ 2
While the mask itself lacks staying power, reviewers rated the postmask feel of this budget option from My Beauty Diary as highly as they did the Dr. Jart. "My skin somehow drank up all the mask juice," a reviewer with dry skin said, "even though it was extremely drippy and difficult to stay put." For best results, you'll want to sit mostly still while wearing this mask, which fit nearly all our panelists' faces well enough.
One Last Tip if You're Experiencing Slippage
Consider a reusable silicone cover. We tried one from Daiso ( $ 5); a reviewer found that it helped seal the My Beauty Diary mask to her face. The cover can be useful "not just to help with occlusion while using disposable sheet masks," Ms. Wong said, "but also with stand-alone serums."

Texto completo: Honky tonk girls
Loretta Lynn visiting her hero Patsy Cline in the hospital is considered a musical milestone. The biopic "Patsy & Loretta" takes that introduction one step further, delving deep into their offstage relationship. You won't learn nearly as much about their individual importance as you did from Ken Burns' "Country Music," but a fantasy sequence that has Megan Hilty's Cline and Jessie Mueller's Lynn duetting on a cha-cha version of "Blue Moon of Kentucky" is dreamy.
7 p.m. Saturday, Lifetime
Love is in the air
Rom-coms may be an endangered species in theaters, but the genre is alive and kicking in "Modern Love," a new anthology series based on the long-running New York Times column. Watching glamorous stars like Andy Garcia, Tina Fey and Dev Patel flirt and fight to coffeehouse music can get a little precious, but even curmudgeons will be forced to smile when Anne Hathaway leads a musical number in a grocery-store parking lot.
Now streaming on Amazon Prime
Horror can wait
"The Simpsons" latest "Treehouse of Horror" just happens to be the series' 666th episode. But this is one of the least ghoulish of the Halloween-themed outings with rather tame parodies of "Heaven Can Wait," "Stranger Things" and "The Shape of Water." The most devilish joke comes at the expense of Mickey Mouse, an obvious dig at the Walt Disney Co., which recently took over 20th Century Fox.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign sent Facebook a letter about a false video ad that a super PAC ran on the social network.
WASHINGTON -- A 30-second video ad that ran on Facebook this week falsely accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.
"Send Quid Pro Joe Biden into retirement," a narrator in the ad intoned.
The video wasn't released by the Trump campaign, which has produced ads on Facebook with similar accusations in recent weeks. Instead, it was made by an independent political action committee, or super PAC. And it was allowed to run on Facebook with false information, in violation of the social network's policies on misinformation, the Biden presidential campaign wrote in a letter to Facebook on Thursday.
In the letter, which was viewed by The New York Times, the Biden campaign acknowledged that Facebook had a policy of allowing all political leaders' speech and ads to remain up because the company considers them to be newsworthy. But the ad by the super PAC was not from a politician, the Biden campaign wrote, so it needed to be rejected.
"This is a most basic test," Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, said in the letter. "The ad contains transparently false allegations, prominently debunked by every major media outlet in the country over recent weeks. It should be rejected."
The letter exposed another vulnerability for Facebook as it struggles to tackle misinformation in the political ads that are flooding its site ahead of the 2020 presidential election. And it showed that Mr. Biden is escalating a battle against Facebook, blasting it in the letter for selling "the tools to target certain segments of the population with lies."
The Biden campaign's letter was delivered on the same day that Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, delivered a vigorous defense of free expression in a speech in Washington. In the address, which drew strong rebukes from Democrats and civil rights leaders, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that even falsehoods from a politician were important for public discourse.
But Facebook had promised that any other political ads would be submitted to fact-checking. The Biden campaign said that should have included the ad from the super PAC, the Committee to Defend the President.
In an emailed response to the Biden campaign on Friday, which was viewed by The Times, Facebook's head of global campaigns, Katie Harbath, wrote that the ad was now inactive. If the ad ran again, she said, it would be submitted to fact-checking.
Facebook declined to comment further.
A week ago, an ad placed by the Trump campaign made similarly false corruption accusations about Mr. Biden. At the time, Mr. Biden's campaign also sent Facebook a letter asking for the ad's removal. Facebook refused, saying the ad was from a political leader and thus in the public interest.
That decision was criticized by the Biden campaign and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, who has promised to break up Facebook if elected president. Ms. Warren later posted a deliberately false ad on Facebook about Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Trump, daring the company to take it down.
The super PAC's ad this week opened with a silhouette of Mr. Biden in front of an image of the White House. A narrator in a foreboding voice claimed the former vice president had blackmailed and threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine to stop an investigation into a company associated with his son Hunter.
Six versions of the ad were targeted to Facebook users in South Carolina, Iowa and Massachusetts, according to Facebook's ad library. All versions are no longer active.
For years, Facebook has been assailed for unevenly enforcing its content policies across its family of apps, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. The company often reacted to problematic content that surfaced and made seemingly arbitrary decisions to reinstate or remove a given post.
In one of the best-known incidents, in 2016, moderators took down the Pulitzer Prize-winning image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc, the 8-year-old girl who was photographed fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Because Ms. Phuc was naked, the image was removed from Facebook for reasons of child pornography. When Facebook was told about the news value of the image, it was allowed to remain.
Facebook does not permit certain types of material, such as pornography and posts that could incite violence, including hate speech and "dehumanizing" language.
The issue of what Facebook allows and does not allow on its site is unlikely to die down.
At a campaign event on Friday evening in Norfolk, Va., Ms. Warren took a couple of more shots at Mr. Zuckerberg. As she talked about breaking up big tech companies, she said, "Yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I'm looking at you."
When Ms. Warren discussed a wealth tax in her speech, she again brought him up. "And Mark Zuckerberg, I'm still looking at you," she said.
Cecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Mike Isaac from Boston. Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Norfolk, Va.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A career State Department official told impeachment investigators this week that he raised concerns with a senior White House official in 2015 about the son of then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
But the warning from George P. Kent, then a State Department officer stationed in Kiev, was not acted on, according to two people familiar with Mr. Kent's testimony. Mr. Kent, now of the State Department's Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said he told the official that Hunter Biden's position could look like a conflict of interest, given his father's role, and would complicate American efforts to encourage Ukraine to clean up corruption.
The White House official told Mr. Kent that the elder Mr. Biden did not have the "bandwidth" to address the concerns while his older son, Beau, was undergoing cancer treatment, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private deposition.
President Trump on Friday latched onto the rare bit of good news for him coming out of the House's impeachment inquiry. Mr. Kent had also given Democrats plenty of fodder to drive their inquiry forward, but the emergence of any information that could tarnish the Bidens was welcome at the White House, even if White House officials have declared the inquiry illegitimate.
"He excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden's son, saying that he has tremendous problems, tremendous problems, with Joe Biden's son and the Ukraine," Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kent, citing news reports. He added, "It's been a big deal."
Mr. Kent's remarks about the Bidens were first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Kent also voiced concerns about the Trump administration's handling of the United States' relationship with Ukraine, testifying that he and other career officials were all but cut out of decisions regarding the country after a May meeting at the White House.
Andrew Wright and Barry Hartman, lawyers for Mr. Kent, declined to discuss the details of his testimony but cautioned against selectively picking out "elements of his testimony" that "might not give the full picture."
Hunter Biden's work for the Ukrainian firm Burisma Holdings, and an unsubstantiated allegation that his father took official action as vice president to protect the firm from a Ukrainian prosecutor, lie at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump and his private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, both pressured Ukraine's leaders to investigate the Bidens, and House lawmakers are examining whether the White House withheld around $ 400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev to conduct the investigation of the Bidens or other matters of interest to the president.
Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden stood by his record as vice president. Mr. Biden has denied he took any improper actions in connection to his son's work.
"On Joe Biden's watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine, including achieving the removal of an inept prosecutor who shielded wrongdoers from accountability," he said.
It might be useful to Mr. Trump to be able to say his concerns about Hunter Biden's work were shared by State Department officials during the Obama administration. But pressing that point holds risks.
On Friday, Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, expressed unease that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had, during a televised White House briefing Thursday, indicated a link between the withholding of military assistance and the demand for another investigation related to the Democrats. Before reversing himself, Mr. Mulvaney said that Mr. Trump had withheld the funds in part until Ukraine began an investigation into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
Mr. Kinzinger told CNN he was not sure what Mr. Mulvaney was saying the president wanted Ukraine to investigate when he told reporters the aid was withheld pending the investigation. But, he said, if it had anything to do with the Bidens, that would be serious, "because it would be, if it's true, taxpayer-funded aid and policy for political reasons, which is totally wrong."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Former Defense Secretary Needles President in Playful Address at a Charity Dinner

Texto completo: At an annual dinner where leaders poke fun at one another, the former defense secretary took jabs at the president's description of him as "overrated."
Jim Mattis, the former defense secretary, departed from his usual reticence about President Trump and mocked his former boss in a speech on Thursday night that made fun of his bone spur diagnosis during the Vietnam War and his love for fast food.
The president had recently referred to Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star Marine general, as "the world's most overrated general." Mr. Mattis picked up the reference and ran with it for several minutes after being introduced as the keynote speaker at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, an annual charity event in New York where politicians and other leaders typically roast one another.
"I'm not just an overrated general," Mr. Mattis said. "I'm the greatest, the world's most overrated," he said, to laughter and applause.
Turning to address Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Mattis said he "owed" thanks to New York and to Mr. Schumer for bringing up the general's name during the "contentious" meeting where Mr. Trump called him "overrated."
In that meeting at the White House on Wednesday, attended by congressional leaders of both parties, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. Mattis's approach to combating terrorism in the Middle East. The general resigned last year as secretary of defense in protest of the president's decision to pull American troops out of Syria.
Mr. Mattis was "the world's most overrated general," Mr. Trump told the group. "You know why? He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month."
Mr. Mattis said during the speech on Thursday, "I'm honored to be considered that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress."
"So I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals," he said. "And frankly, that sounds pretty good to me."
"And you do have to admit that between me and Meryl, at least we have had some victories," he added.
Mr. Mattis went on, saying that people had asked him during the reception before the dinner whether the "overrated" description had bothered him.
"Of course not," he said in his speech. "I have earned my spurs on the battlefield."
He added: "Donald Trump earned his spurs in a letter from a doctor."
The annual dinner is traditionally a Friars Club-style roast where prominent figures take jabs at one another in a white-tie setting where tickets cost more than $ 1,000.
Mr. Mattis also referred to earlier remarks by the actor Martin Short, who was the master of ceremonies at the dinner, setting up a punch line.
"The only person in the military Mr. Trump does not feel is overrated," Mr. Mattis said. "That's Colonel Sanders," the founder and symbol of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Although Mr. Mattis's remarks were made in a lighthearted setting, they were a departure from his apparent reluctance to comment on the president's actions.
Many noted the contrast between Mr. Mattis's comedic delivery and the sober questions raised by another high-profile retired commander, Adm. William H. McRaven, who wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times that was published the same day.
If Mr. Trump " doesn't demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office -- Republican, Democrat or independent -- the sooner, the better," wrote Admiral McRaven, the man who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. "The fate of our Republic depends upon it."
Before he resigned in December, Mr. Mattis told friends and aides repeatedly that he viewed his responsibility to protect the United States' 1.3 million active-duty troops as worth the concessions necessary as defense secretary to a mercurial president, The New York Times reported at the time.
"My views on treating allies with respect and also being cleareyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held," Mr. Mattis wrote in his resignation letter. "Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position."
Mr. Mattis devoted much of his Thursday speech, which lasted for nearly 17 minutes, to describing political mistrust in the country, the debt owed to those who have fought for liberty -- "among them the American men and women supporting our Kurdish allies" -- and the work it takes to maintain a democracy.
"Meanwhile, the roster of urgent national issues have continued to grow," he said. "Unaddressed, and given the paralysis, impossible to address, and all of this was approaching a level of crisis even before the specter of impeachment arose."
"This is the moment for an act of remembrance," he said. "Remembrance of the core principles we used to know and live by, and that we now seem to have forgotten."

Texto completo: By midweek, as the breaking news alerts, closed-door testimonies and jaw-dropping leaks piled up around us, producers Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter and I realized we had chosen the right time to be in Washington.
We knew it would be a big week in the impeachment inquiry. But it turned out to be momentous.
Our plan was to record a week's worth of shows from The Times's D.C. bureau -- home to dozens of reporters covering the White House, the intelligence agencies and the federal government -- and simultaneously build toward a special Friday episode. We envisioned a documentary that would capture what the impeachment investigation actually sounds like.
Nicholas Fandos, a congressional reporter, agreed to let us follow him around the Capitol as he reported on the parade of witnesses testifying before impeachment investigators. Clare and Rachel worked at all hours, meeting up with Nick in the morning and shadowing him late into the night as he staked out the secure chambers of the House Intelligence Committee and chased down lawmakers during rare breaks in testimony.
As we worked on Friday's episode, we debated how to make the rest of the week's shows capture the energy and personality of the Washington bureau. Rachel had an idea: What if we asked our colleagues to deliver the news summary that I usually say at the end of each show?
We gave it a try on Tuesday, showing up at the desk of Eric Schmitt to ask him about news out of Syria. On Wednesday, we tried again, this time with Mike Schmidt. On Thursday, it was Julie Hirschfeld Davis, and on Friday, Sheryl Gay Stolberg. In classic "Daily" fashion, we made the request on the spot. You can hear busy reporters' genuine reactions: surprise and curiosity, followed by acceptance and, in the end, enthusiasm.
By Thursday, Clare and Rachel had gathered all the field tape they needed, and we sat down with Nick for a final 90-minute interview in the Capitol that would help stitch together a week's worth of audio. We commandeered the only truly quiet room we could find: an empty TV studio, designed for news conferences, featuring a wooden podium that read "U.S. House of Representatives."
On our way out of the Capitol at 10 p.m. on Thursday, Clare had an idea: to read the show's credits, identifying every member of the "Daily" team, as we walked out of the building through a series of doors and marble hallways. In the final moments of Friday's episode, if you listen carefully, you can hear Rachel, Clare and me emerging into the cold night air of downtown Washington, marveling at the moon.

Interrogating the moderator
You heard our National editor, Marc Lacey, at the top of Wednesday's episode about the biggest presidential primary debate in American history. Marc has been around for many debates during his 20-year tenure at The Times, but Tuesday was his first time moderating one, alongside CNN's Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett. We asked him what it was like to be on the other side of the cameras:
"Sure, I was somewhat nervous. I'd have been crazy not to have been. But I must say that my two co-moderators were calming. We would glance at one another during breaks in the action -- we couldn't speak, because we were hooked up to mics -- and send good vibes. One bit of wisdom that Anderson offered me beforehand: 'You're going to feel great when it's over.' He was right."
______
______
On 'The Daily' this week
Monday: How did the Kurds come to be seen as allies to the United States and terrorists to Turkey? Ben Hubbard explains.
Tuesday: "Generally, we don't pay that much attention to ambassadors." Sharon LaFraniere on why we're paying attention now to the former American ambassador to Ukraine, who found herself at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
Wednesday: The fourth Democratic debate showed us who the candidates see as their front-runner. Alex Burns and Maggie Haberman give us the rundown.
Thursday: "Sometimes the worst-case scenario is even worse than you can imagine." David Sanger on how the withdrawal of American troops from Syria led to a crisis that was completely foreseeable and foreseen.
Friday: Nick Fandos with the latest from Washington: Congress is back from recess. The impeachment investigation is in full swing. And this week, several diplomats broke their silence.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Lizzo's breakthrough tune, "Truth Hurts," which spent six weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 chart this year, features the signature line:"I just took a DNA test/ Turns out I'm 100 percent that b----." The lyric originated from a 2017 tweet by singer Mina Lioness and was turned into a meme, which was then used in Lizzo's song "Healthy," created in 2017.
The songwriting brothers Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, who worked on "Healthy," claim say they deserve writing credit on "Truth Hurts" since the song borrows from "Healthy," a tune they co-wrote.
The songwriters credited on "Truth Hurts" are Lizzo, Ricky Reed, Tele and Jesse Saint John. "Truth Hurts" was originally released in September 2017 but got a boost this year after it was featured in the Netflix film "Someone Great."
"After reaching out to Ricky Reed and Lizzo's team about fixing it, we put the song in dispute in 2017 when it came out," Justin Raisen wrote Tuesday on Instagram. "We've tried to sort this out quietly for the last two years ... but were shut down every time."
Lizzo's lawyer Cynthia Arato said in a statement: "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
The New York Times reported that the Raisens rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt.
"The last thing we want to do is throw any negativity toward Lizzo's momentum and movement as a cultural figure. If we believe in what she's preaching, believing in ourselves & our own voices is something we thought she'd understand," Justin Raisen wrote.

Ousted: Country music star Gretchen Wilson, whose hit song, "Here for the Party," features the lyrics, "And I ain't leaving till they throw me out," was ousted from a New Mexico hotel last weekend over noise complaints. A Las Cruces police spokesman said Wilson, 46, and other guests had "worn out their welcome" at the Hotel Encanto de Las Cruces and they helped security remove them. The musician tweeted the hotel asked her to leave "in the middle of the night for no reason." She also called on Twitter followers to "band together to put Hotel Encanto out of business."
Podcastland: TV powerhouse Shonda Rhimes ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") is moving aggressively into the burgeoning podcast world, inking a three-year deal between her company, Shondaland, and iHeartMedia. In a statement, Rhimes said she welcomed the opportunity to expand Shondaland's storytelling into the growing medium, which she praised for a unique sense of boldness and intimacy.
Homicide update: "Tarzan" actor Ron Ely's wife, Valerie Lundeen Ely, 62, was stabbed to death in their California home by their 30-year-old son, Cameron Ely, who was then shot and killed by sheriff's deputies, authorities said. Ron Ely, 81, played the title character on the NBC series "Tarzan" from 1966 to 1968.

David Brooks makes best case for reelecting Trump

Texto completo: New York Times columnist and self-taught psychiatrist David Brooks says there’s no way he can vote to reelect Donald Trump in 2020. But without even knowing it, he just made the best case possible for ensuring that Trump gets another four years in office.
Brooks is one of those conservatives who isn’t really concerned with politics so much as he is with assessing the “character” and “virtue” and “principles” of every Republican who runs for something. And so winning an election or passing a conservative agenda in Congress is always kind of beside the point for Brooks. What’s important to him is that even if every Republican who runs for president from now on loses, well, at least Brooks will be able to say each one of them was a good egg.
Case in point, Brooks in his latest column this week frets that people like him — which is to say, those who at least purport to care about low taxes and the appointment of conservatives to the Supreme Court — may have to vote for Elizabeth Warren next year.
“Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view,” he wrote, “but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards, and soul of this country.”
Brooks may be more concerned with the “norms,” the “values” and the “soul” of America, but for any conservative or Republican who actually cares about policy issues, Brooks' argument actually points towards voting for Trump.
Brooks, you see, is wrong on his central claim. Policies can’t simply be “argued about and reversed.” Sure, in theory they can. But what is the last major liberal screwup that has actually been undone by Republicans? Obamacare is almost entirely still here. Medicare and Social Security are still bankrupting the country.
As Trump has learned, it’s almost impossible to permanently undo a disaster started by a previous administration. Congress will almost never help and anything a new president tries to do unilaterally is frequently kicked down by the courts.
With a President Warren, every conservative voter who hates Trump should ask himself: Which one of her crazy policies are they willing to see permanently enacted into law? Is it her promise to abolish private health insurance? Is it her plan to fling open the southern border and welcome in every poor and sick person south of Texas?
Reelecting Trump is the only way we avoid either one of those things, at least for a little while longer. But if Trump loses, well, Brooks can feel happy again that “the soul of this country” is once again on the rebound.

Democrats impeachment secrecy rises

Texto completo: Not long ago, House Republicans complained that Democrats imposed excessive secrecy on interviews conducted as part of the drive to impeach President Donald Trump. Now, the situation appears to have gotten worse.
The recent interview of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, marked a new point — a low point, as Republicans see it — in Democratic efforts to keep impeachment information out of public view.
In this way: The two previous impeachment interviews — with former ambassador to the European Union Kurt Volker and intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson — were conducted in the format of what is known as a transcribed interview. Rep. Adam Schiff, who is running the Democratic impeachment effort, decreed that transcripts not be released to the public. At the same time, there were no heavily restrictive rules on what would happen should any member of Congress, acting from memory, reveal things that were said in the interview.
The Yovanovitch session was different. Democrats conducted the interview in the format of a deposition, which is different from a transcribed interview. One key difference is that there are serious penalties for lawmakers who reveal the contents of a deposition. Doing so would almost surely subject the offending member to a House ethics investigation.
All Republicans remember the price paid by Rep. Devin Nunes, who, in 2017, as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, faced an ethics investigation based on a complaint from a Democratic-allied outside group alleging he leaked classified information. Nunes was later cleared of all the charges, but he had to distance himself from some committee activities as the probe slowly proceeded.
Now, some Republican lawmakers express fear of Democrats siccing an ethics investigation on them if they reveal what took place in the Yovanovitch interview, even though none of what was discussed was classified. Look at what happened to Devin, they say.
So Republicans feel tight restrictions on what they can say. What was Yovanovitch asked? What did she answer? Were her answers consistent with what is known about the case? Republicans can’t say, fearful that Schiff and the Democrats will come after them.
Here is the clever part, from the Democratic perspective. As the Yovanovitch interview began, her 10-page opening statement quickly leaked. In it, Yovanovitch made her case for all the press to read. Headline after headline appeared, all based on the statement: — Washington Post: "Ousted ambassador Marie Yovanovitch tells Congress Trump pressured State Dept. to remove her."
— Politico: "Marie Yovanovitch says Trump ousted her over ‘unfounded and false claims.’" — CNN: "Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine says Trump wanted her removed and blames ‘unfounded and false claims.’" — New York Times: "Ukraine Envoy Says She Was Told Trump Wanted Her Out Over Lack of Trust."
— Wall Street Journal: "Trump Pressed for Ukraine Envoy’s Removal, She Tells Lawmakers."
Democrats and Yovanovitch got their side of the story out without any rebuttal from Republicans. Beyond the leaked written statement, what did she actually say in the deposition? Did Republicans question her about her claims? Did the questioning reveal any facts not included in Yovanovitch’s opening statement? Were there any contradictions?
None of that was known. Yovanovitch’s opening statement instantly became the accepted version of the story. Meanwhile, Republicans said nothing.
Take, for example, Rep. Scott Perry, one of the four GOP House members in the room. Appearing on Fox News, Perry was asked what was said at the deposition. "Unfortunately, in the ever-changing rules situation here, I can’t tell you what happened in that room," Perry answered.
In private conversation, other sources were equally reticent. All were silenced by the Democrats’ strategic use of House procedures.
"Depositions are governed by very specific House regulations," said a House staffer in a text exchange. "Only one lawyer can ask questions per round, agency counsel is barred from attending, and the testimony is close hold. Transcribed interviews, in comparison, really don’t have any hard rules." The only exception, the staffer said, is a closed session of the Intelligence Committee, which is not what the Yovanovitch deposition was.
Finally, the contents of the interview are being kept secret, not only from the public, but from other lawmakers. Perhaps a dozen members have heard any of the testimony in the impeachment hearings so far. The other 420 or so don’t know what went on.
In his much-criticized letter to Congress, White House counsel Pat Cipollone said Democratic handling of the impeachment investigation "violates fundamental fairness." He meant fairness toward the target of the proceeding, President Trump. But there is also the question of fairness toward the American people trying to follow an impeachment process shrouded in secrecy. Don’t they have the right to know what the president’s accusers say?

Texto completo: Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas who has become enmeshed in the Ukraine scandal, said he would resign as secretary of energy.
Rick Perry, the energy secretary who has drawn scrutiny for his role in the controversy surrounding President Trump's efforts to push Ukraine officials to investigate the son of a political rival, told the president on Thursday that he would resign from the cabinet.
The Perry resignation had been anticipated for several weeks, even before the news emerged of his involvement in efforts to pressure the new president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate a company that had worked with Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
In the ensuing weeks, Mr. Perry has been drawn deeper into the questions around the pressure campaign on Mr. Zelensky, which has spurred an impeachment inquiry that threatens to engulf Mr. Trump's presidency.
Mr. Perry told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Wednesday night that he was in contact with Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani about Ukraine-related matters at the direction of Mr. Trump.
It is not known exactly when Mr. Perry will leave his post, but the president said in Texas on Thursday that it would be by the end of the year. The New York Times had earlier reported a similar timeline for Mr. Perry's departure.
Mr. Perry has been instrumental in supporting what President Trump has called a policy of American "energy dominance," which includes increasing the exports of United States fossil fuels to Ukraine and elsewhere.
As energy secretary, Mr. Perry oversaw a sharp increase in the production of fossil fuels, particularly liquefied natural gas, and promoted it with a patriotic fervor -- even dubbing the fossil fuel "freedom gas" and likening its export to Europe to the United States efforts to liberate the continent during World War II.
"The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent," Mr. Perry told reporters in Brussels in May, according to Euractiv.com. "And rather than in the form of young American soldiers," Mr. Perry said, "it's in the form of liquefied natural gas."
Mr. Perry also led a failed effort to engineer a federal bailout for struggling coal and nuclear power plants. Though the plan ultimately ran afoul of White House advisers, Mr. Perry has continued to maintain that the government still has the option of keeping aging plants operating, even as he asserted that incentives might be a better path forward.
Mr. Perry may have once infamously forgotten the name of the Energy Department. But in two years leading the agency, he has overseen an almost 25 percent expansion of its budget.
A former Texas governor, Mr. Perry also avoided many of the personal scandals that had bested his counterparts at other agencies. In part because of that, those who know Mr. Perry have said at various points throughout the administration Mr. Trump has considered his energy secretary to fill other cabinet vacancies, including secretary of veterans affairs.
Mr. Trump also considered Mr. Perry, 69, to become his chief of staff after John F. Kelly resigned, and more recently to take over the Department of Homeland Security after Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation, according to two people close to Mr. Perry.

Allies of Transportation’s Elaine Chao rip New York Times ‘partisan harassment'

Texto completo: The New York Times is coming under fire by allies of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao for rehashing old allegations against her and then concluding in an editorial, “There is no evidence that Ms. Chao has broken any laws.”
Transportation insiders and political supporters of Chao, and husband Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, called an editorial published today “fake news media harassment.”
The report goes over old territory that the secretary believes has been asked and answered. In criticizing the Times, her allies were venting frustration with the repetition of the attacks.
It raised questions from the House Oversight and Reform Committee about the number of times she has met with officials from her home state of Kentucky and her family ties to a Chinese firm.
The editorial, headlined, "Elaine Chao, Mitch McConnell and Questions of Conflict,” used 974 words to say, “Congress wants answers from the transportation secretary, wife of the Senate majority leader, about the apparent mixing of public and family business.”
But by the time it got to word No. 920, it said, “There is no evidence that Ms. Chao has broken any laws.”
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, condemned the editorial as a rehash of old, noncontroversial news meant as a “smear job.”
Noting the “no evidence line,” he said the Times was “admitting there’s no there there.”
He also praised Chao as one of the administration’s “greatest” for being a key deregulator, and he added that her eight years as former President George W. Bush’s labor secretary was also good for the country.
A department spokesman called it “groundless partisan harassment.” A spokesman added, “The New York Times’ and congressional Democrats’ recycling of one another’s already discredited accusations is transparently political. The department has been forthcoming, every question has been answered, and every accusation refuted.”
Lisa B. Nelson, the CEO of the American Legislative Exchange Council, told Secrets, “Elaine Chao has been a tireless public servant for decades and it is a shame that people are trying to divert attention from their own issues when it has been clearly stated that there is no evidence of wrongdoing on her part.”
One of the concerns raised about her is the large number of times she meets with Kentuckyians.
A spokesman said, “There’s nothing unusual or untoward about a secretary seeing people from her home state. There is no financial interaction between the secretary and her family’s company. Even though the Department’s Ethics Officer said there is no conflict of interest, the secretary sold her shares in Vulcan Materials,” a local firm.
Norquist suggested that the real target is McConnell, up for reelection and criticized by liberals and the media for pushing through President Trump’s judges, especially two on the Supreme Court.
“Basically they wrote a TV ad that an opponent would use," he said.

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that could open the internet floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a retired child safety and cybercrimes police detective, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents do not need dangerous new gateways through which their children can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year — more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
Three specific questions need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet crimes investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Texto completo: A recent documentary about Toni Morrison hits Hulu. And a Hitchcockian thriller with Sam Worthington is on Netflix.
What's Streaming
TONI MORRISON: THE PIECES I AM (2019) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. When her novel "Paradise" was banned in Texas prisons in the 1990s because of the perception that the book had been written to disrupt prison life and could potentially cause strikes or riots, Toni Morrison had a response that the authorities likely didn't anticipate. Morrison recalls in this documentary: "I thought, 'How powerful is that?"' A lengthy interview with Morrison is the ballast of this movie about her, which steers away from telling a typical, straight-ahead story of Morrison's life and instead offers a kind of meditation on the significance of her work. That is achieved through interviews with, in addition to Morrison, figures like Oprah Winfrey, Angela Davis, Fran Lebowitz, Sonia Sanchez and Robert Gottlieb. "If you want a thorough documentation of everything Morrison has done and everyone she knows, there's always Wikipedia," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "But if you'd prefer an argument for her importance and a sense of her presence, then you won't be disappointed."
FRACTURED (2019) Stream on Netflix. Hitchcockian suspense can be found in this thriller, which stars Sam Worthington as a man trying to solve his way out of mysterious circumstances. After their daughter, Peri (Lucy Capri), is injured in an accident, Ray (Worthington) and Joanne (Lily Rabe) check Peri into a hospital. Soon after, Peri and Joanne disappear. The hospital denies that they were ever there, leaving an increasingly unnerved Ray to find out what happened. Expect to be on tenterhooks: The movie is the latest from the director Brad Anderson, who is known for both horror movies and thrillers like "Transsiberian," "The Machinist," and "The Call."
BIRDMAN (2014) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. "When something like 'Birdman' comes along, I'm on MDMA creatively," Edward Norton recently told The New York Times Magazine. Those itching to see Norton's soon-to-be-released adaptation of "Motherless Brooklyn" can in the meantime revisit his performance in this drama from Alejandro González Iñárritu, for which Norton was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor. (The film won best picture, among other awards.) Norton plays a method actor performing in a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver story. Michael Keaton stars as a faded celebrity who hopes performing in the play will revive his career.
What's on TV
LIBERTY: MOTHER OF EXILES (2019) 9 p.m. on HBO. The documentary filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato have in the past made movies revolving around American stars like Robert Mapplethorpe and Carrie Fisher. This new documentary from the duo focuses on another, taller superstar: the Statue of Liberty. Hosted by the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, the movie looks at the statue's history and what it means to people around the world.

The Truth? This Could Hurt Lizzo

Texto completo: Two brothers say the song's signature lyric came out of their writing session, and are seeking credit. The singer's team says the claim has no merit.
For millions of listeners, Lizzo's hit "Truth Hurts" has been more than just the No. 1 song in the country, the position it held on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for six weeks this summer and fall.
An ebullient anthem of empowerment, the song has thoroughly penetrated pop culture, appearing in online memes by everyone from teenage TikTok users to Hillary Clinton. "Truth Hurts" has also introduced Lizzo as a new kind of star: an outspoken, body-positive woman of color, who is expected to be a major contender at next year's Grammy Awards.
But who wrote the song?
That question has been quietly in dispute for months. The song's official credits list four writers: Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson; Ricky Reed, her primary producer; Tele, another producer; and Jesse Saint John. But a pair of songwriting brothers, Justin and Jeremiah Raisen, say they were involved in an early writing session with Lizzo that adapted a tweet into the song's signature lyric -- "I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100 percent that bitch" -- and were denied credit.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The brothers are careful to praise Lizzo as a singular and inspiring force. "What she is doing for culture is unlike anything we've seen a modern pop star do, maybe ever," they said in an interview. But as their efforts to obtain credit -- as well as a share of the royalties for what may well become a multimillion-dollar song -- have dragged on without resolution, they decided to speak out.
"It's not fair that we were not included," said Justin Raisen, who has developed a specialty working with female artists like Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX and Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth.
Cynthia S. Arato, a lawyer for Lizzo, strongly denied the Raisens' claim.
"The Raisens are not writers of 'Truth Hurts,"' Arato said in a statement. "They did not collaborate with Lizzo or anyone else to create this song, and they did not help write any of the material that they now seek to profit from, which is why they expressly renounced any claim to the work, in writing, months ago."
Reed declined to comment.
Credit disputes are common in the music industry, but do not often become public. In the case of "Truth Hurts," the disagreement involves a crucial part of Lizzo's persona and brand -- she has applied for a trademark for the phrase "100% That Bitch," and sells T-shirts on her website featuring those words.
For an industry that has already been shaken by controversial copyright cases, like the multimillion-dollar jury verdicts over Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" and Katy Perry's "Dark Horse," the "Truth Hurts" episode raises another knotty question: Who has the right to claim authorship over even small phrases in a song, when multiple people were "in the room" when they were created?
According to the Raisen brothers -- who grew up as rock fans on Long Island and are now part of the songwriting and production circuit in Los Angeles -- they held a joint songwriting session in April 2017 with Lizzo and two other writers, Saint John and Yves Rothman.
While the five of them worked on a song called "Healthy," the brothers said, Saint John pulled up a meme on his phone based on a tweet that read: "I did a DNA test and found out I'm 100% that bitch." They all laughed, and Jeremiah said that he suggested including the lyric in the song.
Lizzo sang it almost identically to the way those words appear in "Truth Hurts," as demonstrated in a recording from the session that the brothers shared with The New York Times and later posted on Instagram. Jeremiah also said he helped write the melody for "Healthy," including the "DNA test" line.
(In another complication to the song's origins, the woman who wrote the tweet, a British singer who goes by the name Mina Lioness, has complained bitterly that she, too, deserves credit.)
Danny Riordan, an aspiring songwriter and friend of the Raisens who said he was present for part of the "Healthy" session, remembered the excitement in the room as the song boomed over the studio speakers.
"Everyone was like, 'Oh my God, this is going to be huge,"' Riordan said.
Five months after the session that produced "Healthy," "Truth Hurts" was released, and the Raisens said they were surprised that Lizzo's song contained the "DNA test" line but without credit given to them or Rothman.
"There was a bittersweet emotion, because deep in our hearts we know that we were a part of this song," Jeremiah Raisen said. "We should feel validated but we're not."
The Raisens said they began their campaign shortly after, seeking 5 percent each of the songwriting royalties from "Truth Hurts." As the song climbed to No. 1 this summer, the brothers took up something of a vigilante campaign on social media, posting congratulatory messages to Lizzo while also aggressively arguing their case.
But the Raisens' case may be complicated by the fact that they rescinded an earlier claim over "Truth Hurts" through their publisher, Kobalt, which Lizzo's representatives believe should bar them from pursuing the matter further.
Lizzo's representatives do not contest that the session yielded "Healthy" and its "DNA test" line. The crux of the disagreement is who did what: The brothers say the session was conducted with the understanding that all parties were contributing to the resulting work, and that Lizzo's vocal was tailored to the instrumental track they created. Lizzo's representatives say the Raisens were not involved in creating Lizzo's vocal line and so have no claim to it now.
But the law may favor the Raisens on this point, said Don Gorder, the chairman of the music business and management department of the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
"Copyright law says that if a work is created and it's clearly the intention of all the people who contributed that it's merged into a whole," Professor Gorder said, "that they are all equal owners of the song unless they agree otherwise."
As part of their campaign, the Raisens commissioned an opinion from a musicologist, who concluded that "Truth Hurts" has "some strikingly similar lyric and musical elements to those in 'Healthy,"' and that Lizzo's hit "would not exist in its present form without the existence of and the borrowing from 'Healthy."'
Lizzo's representatives portray the Raisens' claim as a common hazard for artists with a big hit, and say that theirs is baseless. After six weeks at No. 1, "Truth Hurts" finally fell to second place on Billboard's Hot 100 chart on Monday, replaced by Travis Scott's "Highest in the Room."
"Although it has become all too commonplace for successful artists to be subjected to these type of opportunistic claims," Arato said, "it is nevertheless disappointing that after all of her hard work, Lizzo has to respond to this specious claim."
The disagreement over "Truth Hurts" may involve another precious currency: a Grammy. Although the song is two years old, Grammy rules allow it to be nominated for next year's awards because it was part of a 2019 album -- it was added to "Cuz I Love You" as a bonus track -- and had not been previously submitted. (The song's popularity exploded this year thanks in part to TikTok memes and a prominent Netflix placement, and as Lizzo's public appearances established her as a charismatic new star.)
At the Grammys, "Truth Hurts" is under consideration for both record and song of the year, and Lizzo is considered a leading candidate for best new artist. Nominations will be announced Nov. 20.

Texto completo: Media companies merged to take on tech, and tech giants are producing media. Edmund Lee, a media reporter, has his eyes on what comes next.
How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Edmund Lee, a media reporter, discussed the tech he's using.
What tech tools do you rely on most for reporting on the media industry?
My iPhone is my everyweapon. It's for emails, texts, Signals, interviews, notes, even suggestions for the best subway route. (I swear by Citymapper, which my wife recommended.)
My typical use case goes something like this: I'll be headed to a news conference when a source Signals, saying he's in town. I'll check my calendar and text back a possible time as I hunt through OpenTable for a reservation somewhere convenient. After I find a spot, I'll send a calendar invite. By then, I'm exiting the subway and Slacking my editor about when I'll be back in the office.
Like most reporters, I'm incredibly impatient. Smartphones are the best (or worst?) enablers for that kind of pathology.
I've also filed stories from my phone. In May, I was occupied at a news conference when the Walt Disney Company announced it was buying control of Hulu. My laptop was dead, and all the outlets in the room were taken. I tapped out almost the entire article from the compose window of my email app.
Also, I hate to say it, but Twitter.
Twitter, really?
Really. I'm not being cheeky. You have to go where the sources are, and when it comes to media, a lot of them are on Twitter. A lot. I follow the usual suspects, but I also make myself known.
Last year, I interviewed the AT&T executive who was put in charge of WarnerMedia, and in my tweet promoting the piece, I highlighted a comment he made about the importance of culture fit between the two companies. A source direct-messaged me in disbelief. We chatted, and that led to a story about a closed-door town hall at HBO that exposed some of those culture differences. It got a lot of attention.
And, yes, my DMs are open.
But my best tool is the in-person meeting. I think that's true for most reporters. Sources want to make sure they can trust you. And a lot can be revealed with just a look. A look can tell you where to hunt for a particular story. So the restaurant, the bar, the coffee shop are important tools. I go out a lot.
Clothes are a device, too. Not to stick out but to blend in. A close-cut suit and cordovan lace-ups when appropriate. The look changes if it's someone in Hollywood or Palo Alto, but you get the idea.
What do you personally use to consume media?
I'm the opposite of a cord cutter. I've had the same cable account for nearly 20 years. I also have most of the streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, CBS All Access and even PBS, which offers a $ 5-a-month app.
I'll toggle from the Yankees game on my cable feed to the Netflix app on my Roku box to binge "Derry Girls" (it's great) while scrolling through Twitter on my phone.
And for media geeks like me, HBO's "Succession" is everything. The second season really shines. I have a few quibbles, but I'm amazed by its vivid accuracy. Plus, witness Sunday Night Twitter, when broadcasting your favorite lines becomes its own piece of theater.
How has streaming changed the media industry?
Streaming is both a reaction to and a cause of cord cutting, but really it just means more content. It's worth noting that for all of tech's disruptions, Apple and Amazon are now in the business of producing what is essentially cable television. Google and Facebook, too. You have to wonder when one of them will just buy a media company.
I'm not saying it'll happen, but there were nearly $ 200 billion in history-making media mergers in the past year. All the big ones are done. The next one -- if there is to be one -- will be a tech giant swallowing a media giant. The irony is that media merged to take on tech, but it's one possible outcome.
I'll add one more note: Robert A. Iger, the head of Disney, published a book in September that reads as a sort of business memoir. In it, he writes that he believes if Steve Jobs were still alive, Apple would most likely have bought Disney. That's fascinating. Saying it out loud isn't what makes it interesting. Saying it out loud more than a year after Disney agreed to buy the majority of Rupert Murdoch's media empire for $ 71.3 billion is what makes it interesting.
Is social media a blessing or a curse?
I guess social media somehow felt inevitable? It reminds me of the 1980s TV series "Max Headroom." The log line went something like this: In the future, an all-powerful TV network controls society through subliminal programming. Sound familiar?
The premise was more fanciful than the current reality, but the show presciently dramatized the disinformation campaigns we're now witnessing across social media, except the social media companies are also the unwitting tools. (I suspect Netflix or HBO or Amazon may want to revive the show.)
Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?
Semi-seriously, is there anything outside of work?
But seriously, our household has the usual stuff. We have an Alexa that my wife can't stand. I use it as a timer and to check when our packages are coming. We have several Philips Hue smart bulbs that are a nifty way to set up the lights.
My coffee grinder is my most consistently prized nonwork gadget. It's a Baratza Encore and it's not cheap, but I have to have good coffee. It's the only way I can resolve myself in the morning.
And our teenage daughter is an expert at piping Spotify through our Sonos speakers as she flips through her Instagram while swiping through Netflix on our iPad to find something to watch. I have no idea where she gets it from.

JESSE PINKMAN BREAKS BAD ONE LAST TIME IN NETFLIX'S 'EL CAMINO'; BINGEWORTHY

Texto completo: If you think of Netflix's "El Camino" as a new, two-hour episode of "Breaking Bad," you'll be disappointed.
"El Camino," which premiered Friday, takes place immediately after the series finale of the AMC show about high school science teacher turned meth kingpin Walter White. But it doesn't move the story forward one inch.
Instead, writer-director and show creator Vince Gilligan has taken the one big, dangling loose end from the TV show the fate of Walter White's protégé, Jesse Pinkman and crafted a taut, self-contained movie out of it.
For those who don't remember, the last season of "Breaking Bad" ended in a hail of bullets, as White (Bryan Cranston) wiped out the white supremacists who had hijacked his business and taken Jesse (Aaron Paul) hostage. White died in the onslaught, but the last we saw of Jesse, he was driving away, traumatized by the experience, but free.
"El Camino" details what happened next. The subject of a manhunt by police (he was a meth dealer, after all), Jesse is hiding out in Albuquerque, trying to stay one step ahead of the police while figuring out how to restart his life. One of the real pleasures of "El Camino" is seeing cameos from some of the supporting characters that gave "Breaking Bad" such flavor and texture.
Fans will savor seeing the return of Jesse's delightfully scuzzy buddies Badger and Skinny Pete and the dyspeptic junkyard owner Old Joe. But it is especially poignant seeing Robert Forster, who died this past weekend, take one more turn as the mysterious fixer who serves as a one-man witness protection program for criminals on the lam. Forster brings such dignity and wry humor to the role, a guy who consorts with bad guys but who has a rigid moral code.
Gilligan layers on even more fan service in flashback scenes (newly created for "El Camino") in which Jesse recalls conversations with some of the central characters from "Breaking Bad." I won't spoil who pops up, although it's particularly fun to see Paul get to play the younger, dumber Jesse again in those flashbacks.
In the present, Jesse is an older, more haunted figure, and "El Camino" gives him one desperate situation after another to figure his way out of. The movie ratchets up the tension without losing the black comedy that made "Breaking Bad" such a compulsively watchable show.
Is "El Camino" essential viewing? Not at all. But for those who loved the show, it puts a satisfying exclamation point on the end of the series.
Also on streaming: The " Modern Love" column in the New York Times has inspired a new anthology rom-com show of the same name, premiering Friday on Amazon Prime. Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Andrew Scott are part of a ridiculously strong cast in the show that looks at love in all of its forms.
Remember the "Disney Vault"? Back when DVDs and VHS tapes were popular, Disney would release movies for a little while, telling consumers that they'd return to "the Vault" after a limited time. Want to watch "Cinderella" in a year? Better buy it before it goes back into "the Vault"!
Well, the new Disney+ streaming service feels like getting the combination to the Vault. Disney released the movie titles that will be available on the service, and it's a cornucopia of family films from Disney classics like the original "Lion King" to recent favorites like Pixar's "Inside Out." For me, what's most attractive is all the mediocre, live-action Disney movies that I devoured as a kid in the 1970s. "Apple Dumpling Gang"? Sign me up! CREDIT: By Rob Thomas

The fallout over the Trump-media video reveals the need for decency in politics

Texto completo: In this political climate, it takes very little for either side to get outraged over the actions of a small percentage of the opposition. This is a shame: Although deep ideological conflicts will always exist, the majority of individuals in both parties are not living, breathing embodiments of the worst of extremes. From the militant leftist group antifa to hate mongering white supremacists that claim the Right as their home, the fringes of both sides do not represent the whole.
But the failure of so many to grasp this is on display once again, after a Sunday article in the New York Times exposed a disturbing video depicting a fictional Trump shooting media members and critics that was shown at the president’s resort. As if on cue, conclusions were made about the liberal media's tendency to blow things out of proportion. And in response, Republicans and Trump supporters were once again smeared as lunatics in waiting, who either in word or deed support violence against the media.
In the midst of the nonstop partisan volley, which really began in 2016, both sides have clearly forgotten the need for decency.
To his credit, President Trump reportedly condemned the video. Though the president routinely calls out the "fake news media" and has branded the media "the enemy of the American people," he neither ordered the creation of the modified movie clip nor praised it. But Trump’s positive actions will never satisfy his detractors, and unfortunately, he gives them plenty of real material to condemn when he routinely engages in ridicule and mockery of his own.
There is a shocking lack of decorum in these charged times among the general electorate. And while we can look to the Oval Office for direction, we should not use the president as a moral bellwether. Principles of behavior should be constant no matter who controls the government or the media landscape.
Still, there is no requirement that says Republicans must respond to every claim made by the many newspapers, websites, and television channels that all lean left. However, if one feels the need to comment on a video showing the president of the United States murdering his high-profile enemies, there must be clear condemnation.
The suggestion to "lighten up" that quickly became a talking point by some on the Right in response to the video is ethically lazy and deeply disappointing. The propensity for pro-Trump Republicans to view everything as unimportant must end.
Conversely, those who dislike the president have much more legitimate and substantive criticisms to focus on. With an election on the horizon, concerns abroad in China and Syria, and an investigation into the Ukraine call, why spend a news cycle obsessing over a previously obscure tape? Well, from a liberal perspective, it fuels the burning hatred many harbor toward the president, so it's worth doing.
Individuals looking in from outside of the fray between pure partisans should ask themselves, "How can my own reaction reduce the ongoing conflict?" The answer is simple: honestly assess the situation and then respond accordingly.
For Republicans, there is every available opportunity to say the video in question is not amusing and entirely inappropriate. The problem is not those who are "triggered" by the video, it's that the video exists in the first place and was shown at a pro-Trump event.
For Democrats and other leftists, the reaction should consist of acknowledging that while the video is bad, it is (thankfully) not official material from the Trump administration. And importantly, it does not represent the desires of most or many GOP voters. Furthermore, if a similarly horrifying video were to come out during a Democratic president's term, Democratic voters and the liberal media would not want to be blamed for it.
Of course the video is disturbing, however, it is not a trend. So it’s disheartening that so many seem to believe it is either nothing, or everything.

White House investigating handling of Ukraine phone call transcript

Texto completo: White House lawyers are reportedly looking into how the transcript of President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was handled prior to its release to the public.
The investigation involves why deputy White House counsel John Eisenberg decided to place the transcript of the call into a secure server typically reserved for extremely sensitive information, according to the New York Times.
The Times reported that the probe may be driven by White House officials looking for a scapegoat for the call that served as the basis for an intelligence community whistleblower complaint, which spurred an impeachment inquiry against Trump by Democrats in the House.
"We released the conversation unredacted showing the whole world the president did nothing wrong," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement.
Several conversations between Trump and other foreign leaders prior to the call with Zelensky were leaked to the press. The leaks pushed the White House to begin keeping some records of calls in the more secure server to protect the records and more easily identify potential leakers, should any more transcripts or contents of the calls appear in the press.
The White House did not immediately respond to the Washington Examiner's request for comment.

Texto completo: 2020 presidential long shot Julián Castro took aim at CNN and the New York Times for the topics that were addressed during Tuesday night's Democratic presidential primary debate.
Castro, 45, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, took exception with the news outlets for failing to cover housing reform, homelessness, and immigration during the debate, which once again featured questions on healthcare.
He spoke with MSNBC's Chris Hayes following the debate and began by saying he felt like the moderators missed foreign policy questions regarding North Korea and China, adding there were also "very significant gaps on the domestic side too.”
“I challenge CNN and the New York Times to ask, finally ask, about homelessness and housing," Castro stated. "I tried to insert a little bit about that in some of my answers. But we talked about Ellen [DeGeneres] at the end. I know what the point of the question was, but we keep leaving some of these huge issues that impact families off of the question agenda at these debates. And really, it’s journalistic malpractice to do that.”

The MSNBC prime-time anchor then commented that the reason healthcare is brought up repeatedly during the debates is because "there are real lines of dispute quite crystal clear, right, about this question." He asked Castro if the candidate felt voters are "as focused" on the topic.
"I think they’re focused on healthcare, sure," Castro replied. "I think every family is focused on whether they have good healthcare or how they can get it. I also think that they’re focused on the fact that a lot of people can’t pay the rent, right? And so there are these sort of issues that are never touched on that intimately affect families every single day, that we just never get to."

Texto completo: The first casualty of the fall season appears to be “Sunnyside," the NBC Thursday night sitcom starring Kal Penn.
The show, which premiered on Sept. 26, will be pulled from the schedule after this Thursday's episode; the remaining episodes will move NBC's digital platforms. Penn plays a disgraced local politician who tries to rehab his image — and, perhaps, his heart — by helping immigrants become American citizens. But viewers weren't watching. It has had the lowest ratings of any NBC show this fall — and of any of the four main networks' new fall shows.
To fill the gap, NBC is going to begin the final (and they mean FINAL final) season of “Will & Grace" early. It was originally due next year, but now it will premiere on Oct. 24 at 9:30 p.m., with 18 episodes in all.
By the way, in the promo for “Will & Grace," we learn that Grace is pregnant. “What an amazing mom you're going to be," Will says to her. “I mean, by the time this baby's my age, I'll be — well, I'll be dead."
Jack response to Grace's news: “You're trying to cook a baby in an old 1970s Easy-Bake, lady."
By the way, only one new network show has gotten a full-season order: Fox's “Prodigal Son," a drama about a profiler and his serial killer dad.

Texto completo: We should consider the ethical implications of satellites that can identify us, and our license plates, from space.
When President Trump tweeted an image of Iran's Imam Khomeini Space Center in August, amateur satellite trackers were shocked by the image's high resolution. After some sleuthing, they concluded it came from USA 224, a highly classified satellite launched in 2011 by the National Reconnaissance Office and believed to be part of the multibillion-dollar KH-11 program. Not only did the satellite's size, location and orbit match the vantage point of the image, but only such a state-of-the-art satellite could possibly capture details like the clear Persian writing on the launchpad's edge.
That the technology to clearly see something as small as a coffee mug -- or smaller -- could already exist, or be developed very soon, should not be taken lightly. The commercial satellite imagery business has grown tremendously over the past decade, with over 700 Earth observational satellites now in orbit, and imagery resolution keeps improving. We must consider the longer-term implications of having commercial high-resolution satellite image of this quality and what will happen when we can identify individuals or license plates from space -- because that's not far-off. We are not ready for the ethical boundaries this invasion of privacy will cross.
In just 15 years, we've gone from being able to see things the size of 40-inch TVs to those the size of smart tablets. There are government controls on the resolution of commercially available satellite imagery, but this progress suggests we will get 0.20 meters resolution imagery or better in the next five years, and imagery as good as from current American spy satellites -- which, if the image of the Khomeini Space Center is anything to go by, seems to be about 0.10 meters resolution -- in the next decade.
Drones can be shot out of the sky, yet little can be done to combat or hide from cameras virtually invisible from the ground. No one consents to being imaged from space. There are areas blurred out on Google Earth, but no laws prevent your property from being captured by commercial satellites.
And what about the countless hallowed grounds across the globe that are not meant to be visited by outsiders? Viewing imagery of these sites or peoples from above with no permission is no less of a colonialist act and may cause harm to communities that did not choose to be imaged, like "uncontacted" tribal groups in Brazil, who could then face further attacks from loggers or miners.
I believe in the tremendous power of satellite data. I use imagery to detect potential archaeological sites, which I then survey or excavate; it allows us to see everything from buried Viking walls to entire city maps in Egypt. The technology has enabled scientists to track the burning of the rain forests in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru; the melting of polar icecaps and potential collapses of penguin colonies; and images before and after tsunamis, which can be used for relief fund-raising.
Yet I also imagine a dystopian not-so-distant future where we can direct very high-resolution satellites to any point on Earth, easily identifying a person's location or activities. Who will have access to this data? The police? Politicians looking for dirt on their opponents, or angry spouses with a vendetta? How will this data be used in courts -- and who can be trusted to interpret it? The thought of potential misuses is chilling.
[If you're online -- and, well, you are -- chances are someone is using your information. We'll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter .]
Rapid imaging of Earth's surface is already underway. Small satellites called doves allow for consistent location imaging. These, alongside NASA and commercial satellites, track illegal logging and fishing operations. By 2021, Maxar Technologies, a space technology company, will be able to take snapshots of the same location every 20 minutes. This development has so much potential to do good. I find myself torn between being an enthusiastic remote-sensing scientist and an anthropologist who would never take a photo of anyone, anywhere, without permission.
We need to start conversations now about who and what should be imaged from space -- and about how to create ways for Indigenous people or governments to ask for their sacred or sensitive spaces to be respected. For example, Globalxplorer, the cultural heritage organization I founded, is taking its citizen archaeology satellite platform to India next. To date, 94,600 citizen scientists from over 100 countries have examined 17.5 million satellite images of Peru and have located over 19,000 anthropogenic features, 700 of which are major archaeological sites. We already have a list of places the Indian government does not want to be imaged. All it took was an honest conversation to establish the limits of our data sharing. This is about privacy and respect, and we must develop global guidelines and policies.
The United States has the most powerful satellites in the world, but China, Russia and others are not far behind. Just because we have great technology in the United States does not mean we have the authority to decide how to use it ethically, nor will we be safe once other countries have better satellites. Remote-sensing specialists and everyday users of satellite imagery globally should be leading this conversation, which has enormous implications for our right to exist without everyone knowing where we are at every moment.
The global repercussions of our satellite know-how becoming public knowledge should start a bigger discussion now -- before we step out our front doors, look up, and wonder whether we should smile for the picture.

Texto completo: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii seized on a question about the removal of American troops in Syria to launch a broadside against one of her favorite foes -- the media -- both in coverage of her campaign and coverage of the conflict in Syria.
Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing "regime change" war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war. Not only that but, The New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, The New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears.
The Times article Ms. Gabbard referenced, however, notes that the congresswoman is a frequent topic of Russian state news media; there is no inference that she is a Russian asset. Ms. Gabbard also met with the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in January 2017, and has said in the past that the dictator is "not the enemy of the United States." In August, on CNN, Ms. Gabbard called Mr. Assad a "brutal dictator."
On Tuesday, she also criticized CNN, which was co-hosting the debate with The Times.
This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable. As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens of thousands Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and make sure we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaeda in Syria, who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.
Ms. Gabbard, 38, has often portrayed her campaign as the victim of a rigged system. She threatened as recently as last weekend to boycott the debate, and accused the Democratic National Committee and "corporate media" of trying to usurp the role of voters. It recalled, Ms. Gabbard has alleged, the party's "rigged" 2016 contest.
Ms. Gabbard, whose national polling average was less than 1 percent as of Friday, reported on Tuesday night that her campaign had raised $ 3 million for the third quarter.
As an Iraq war veteran, Ms. Gabbard has attracted a disparate group of followers with her isolationist foreign policy stance, a tack she struck in her answer criticizing the involvement of the United States in what she calls "regime change" wars.
But her characterization of the United States involvement in Syria as a "regime change" war was quickly criticized by another veteran onstage, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., as "dead wrong."
"What we were doing in Syria was keeping our word," Mr. Buttigieg said. "Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too."
American forces have been positioned along the northern Syrian border in what has been described as an unsustainable status quo "frozen in place," helping both root out the Islamic State and protect Kurdish allies from Syrian or Turkish aggression.
Ms. Gabbard's star appeared to be on the rise among Democrats four years ago, but then she rankled the party's establishment by resigning as D.N.C. vice chair to support Senator Bernie Sanders against Hillary Clinton. She also voiced criticism of President Barack Obama -- like many Republicans -- for his unwillingness to use the term "radical Islam."

Violent Trump Video Is Dumb for a Reason

Texto completo: The absurdity of memes like the one shared widely on Sunday evening gives cover to their creators.
A good rule of thumb for politics in 2019 is that everything is both far darker and far more ridiculous than our imaginations can ever predict.
Such is the case with a pro-Trump video reported Sunday evening by The Times. The clip is an edited version of a climactic, hyperviolent scene from the 2014 action film "Kingsman: The Secret Service," in which the protagonist kills nearly 40 people in roughly three minutes while the Lynyrd Skynyrd song "Free Bird" plays. In the clip, President Trump's face is crudely edited on top of the protagonist's during the spree, which involves guns, hand-to-hand combat and, at one point, a blowtorch; his victims' faces have been replaced with the faces of politicians, journalists, entertainers and the logos of media organizations. Then, the fake president shoots in the head a person whose face has been replaced by the Black Lives Matter logo.
The video was shown at a three-day conference at Mr. Trump's Doral resort in Miami, hosted by the pro-Trump organization American Priority. The conference denounced the video as "unauthorized," and a spokesman for Mr. Trump's campaign said the president knew nothing about it. The White House press secretary tweeted on Monday that the president hadn't seen the video but that he "strongly condemns" it based on its description.
Still, the video is jarring, both for its content and for the political climate it has been dropped into. In 2019, there have been at least 21 deadly mass shootings in the United States -- some in places of worship, like April's synagogue shooting in Poway, Calif. Fifty-three people died in mass shootings in August alone. The violence has prompted some Democrats, like the presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, to call for assault weapons bans, while some Republicans have suggested that such bans would lead to "a lot of violence." Two weeks ago, Mr. Trump tweeted a warning from a pastor arguing that "a Civil War like fracture in this Nation" might occur should Mr. Trump be removed from office.
It's this context that makes a video of a faux Mr. Trump murdering what the real Mr. Trump likes to call "the enemy of the people" seem not just in poor taste but actually threatening.
The video clip derives from a pro-Trump meme in which the president's face is superimposed on popular movies, cartoons and sports clips. Most of the memes in this vein are slapsticky in their humor but center on the incendiary and hyperpartisan themes of Mr. Trump's politics. They're meant to be trivial pieces of online ephemera that signal the president's righteousness over the "libs." CarpeDonktum, a stay-at-home dad from Kansas who popularized this style of pro-Trump meme and who has received multiple invitations to meet President Trump at the White House, described these memes to me as "boomer humor," aimed at aging, hyperaggressive political posters on Facebook.
In other words, these memes are empty-headed hyperpartisan sharebait -- grist for the algorithmic mills. And the rudimentary composition of these clips is a feature, not a bug. That the memes look childish provides a veneer of acceptability -- so that they can be shared without getting pulled from social networks. The memes' creators and sharers can giddily watch the president dispatching his enemies while claiming the video is just a funny gag. When confronted, they can throw hands up in the air and cry, "Snowflake!" In their version of reality, the uproar over this video is more proof that overly sensitive liberals are "triggered."

Indeed, MAGAland began relentlessly mocking the Times report on the video within minutes of its publishing. "23 paragraphs, about a meme lol. Yikes this is psychotic," someone wrote on Twitter. "These types of articles is why the meme was made," another replied.
Though quick to yell "triggered," the Trump-Media Industrial Complex frequently claims that the left is trying to incite violence. In 2017, right-wing media protested a performance of "Julius Caesar" in which the title character is played by a Trump doppelgänger and is assassinated via a violent stabbing; it was portrayed by Trump supporters as a dog whistle for an attempt on the president's life. Similarly, in 2017 a tasteless photo shoot of the comedian Kathy Griffin holding Mr. Trump's severed head led to a right-wing campaign suggesting that "CNN Is ISIS." (Ms. Griffin, who had for years co-hosted CNN's New Year's Eve programming, was a victim in the Trump meme video.) And this year, after outrage from the president himself, Universal Pictures canceled the release of the satirical film "The Hunt" after the film's trailer made it appear as if elites were hunting rural Republicans. We're all triggered, it seems.
All of this leaves journalists in a difficult place. Taking the meme video seriously does the unfortunate work of amplifying the clip, increasing view counts and potentially ad revenue from it. Responding to the trollish world of MAGA memes is a lot like arguing with children. To engage at all is, in some way, to lose; no matter how righteous and warranted your outrage is, you're pulled down to their level. So much of Sunday's meme controversy is breathtakingly dumb: It's a childish video based on a second-tier action movie that played on a loop in a Miami conference room as part of a "hall of memes" exhibition. Given all of today's high-stakes political issues -- an impeachment inquiry, chaos in the Middle East, censorship in China -- it seems in some ways that the video belongs in a different universe.
But the grim reality is that the video does belong in this universe -- the same universe where political tensions and polarization have left us all living on edge and tweeting about civil war. And the universe where the conspiratorial hate we see online is increasingly leaking out into the physical world. Maybe it shouldn't be the case that a hastily assembled meme would conjure images of the Florida man who was arrested for sending pipe bombs to at least a dozen perceived critics of President Trump or the neo-Nazi sympathizer who opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 worshipers. But it is the case. Because this is the world we live in.
Which is probably why an alarmed conference attendee last week alerted The Times to the existence of the video via an intermediary. The Venn diagram of playful social media fandoms, toxic online message board culture and mainstream politics looks more like a lone circle every day. Loath as one may be to admit it, memes -- even the inane ones -- do matter in 2019. And sure, we're "triggered." But we have good reason to be.

Texto completo: The Democratic presidential debate being held tonight — Tuesday, Oct. 15, 2019 — in a suburb near Ohio’s capital will bring back a candidate who has been absent from the stage for a while and introduce one who has never before been seen on the party’s debate lineup.
Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard failed to qualify for the September debate but will be back on stage tonight after meeting the Democratic National Committee’s qualifications:
* Earning at least 2% support in four DNC-approved polls
* Receiving contributions from at least 130,000 individual donors
* Of those donors, at least 400 each must come from 20 different states
Also making that cut will be first-time presidential debater Tom Steyer of California. The billionaire hedge fund founder is known for his large contributions to environmental causes and political campaigns.
Along with those two will be the 10 candidates you would expect to see on the stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, listed alphabetically:
* Former Vice President Joe Biden
* New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker
* South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg
* Former HUD Secretary Julián Castro
* California Sen. Kamala Harris
* Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar
* Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke
* Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
* Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
* Businessman Andrew Yang
Tonight’s debate from 5 to 8 p.m. Pacific time is sponsored by the New York Times and CNN and will be carried on the cable network. The moderators are CNN anchors Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, and New York Times editor Marc Lacey.
There are many streaming options, and the debate will air on broadcast radio.

Biden: ‘I’ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room’

Texto completo: 2020 Democratic front-runner Joe Biden claimed that he has spent "thousands of hours" in the White House Situation Room while blasting President Trump over foreign policy.
Biden was vice president for 2,920 days, so to have spent "thousands" — more than 2,000 — hours in the Situation Room would mean he was there for an average of nearly 52 minutes each day.
He was present in the famous Situation Room photograph taken on May 1, 2011 during the Navy SEAL operation that ended in Osama bin Laden being killed. Biden initially said he opposed the operation and told President Barack Obama not to do it. But he later changed his account to say he hedged in front of other officials but privately told Obama to go ahead. Obama, his secretary of state Hillary Clinton, his CIA director Leon Panetta, and his Pentagon chief Bob Gates all said that Biden was opposed.
While fielding questions about Trump's recent decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria during the Ohio debate, the former vice president slammed the president's move.
"I would not have withdrawn the troops and would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops in Iraq, which are in retreat being fired on by Assad’s people, and the president of the United States saying, 'If those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they’re in, they’ll only go to Europe and won’t affect us.' It has been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history — excuse me, in terms of foreign policy," he began.
Biden then called Trump's Syria withdrawal the "most shameful" foreign policy move by a modern American president, driving home his point by touting his experience in the Obama administration and claiming he has spent "thousands of hours" by the former president's side making crucial foreign policy decisions.
He said, "The fact of the matter is, I’ve never seen a time — and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places in Syria, in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what’s happening here."
Biden continued, "What I would do is, I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he’s going to have a problem because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdoğan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done."
The Trump administration announced the withdrawal of troops from northern Syria last week, opening the door for Turkey to invade the country and attack the U.S.-allied Kurds, which it considers terrorists, in the area. The move has been widely slammed by members of both parties, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is even working with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on legislation to "overturn" the decision.

'Women will die': Kamala Harris wrings hands over abortion restrictions

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris took aim at Republicans over abortion access during the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 election season.
During a round of questions on healthcare, the senator from California pointed out that the conversation hadn't yet touched specifically on the topic of women's reproductive care.
"This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle," she said. "Not nearly one word with all of these discussions about health care, on women’s access to reproductive health care. It’s outrageous."
Harris went on to slam states that have recently passed restrictive abortion laws, arguing that their Republican state legislatures are "out of touch with America" and are willing to let "women die."
"There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care," she said. "It is not an exaggeration to say women will die. Poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states, who are out of touch with America, are telling women what to do with their bodies."
She added, "Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women’s bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."
Several pro-life states have passed laws drastically limiting when a woman can have an abortion. Georgia, for example, passed a "heartbeat bill" banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The move, however, has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.
Harris has pledged to address such laws as president, arguing that she'd require states to get federal approval before strict abortion laws could go into effect.

Paul Krugman: Backers have turned God into Trump’s co-conspirator

Texto completo: Listening to the speech William Barr, the attorney general, gave last week at the University of Notre Dame Law School, I found myself thinking of the title of an old movie: “God Is My Co-Pilot.” What I realized is that Donald Trump’s minions have now gone that title one better: If Barr’s speech is any indication, their strategy is to make God their boss’ co-conspirator.
Given where we are right now, you might have expected Barr to respond in some way to the events of the past few weeks — the revelation that the president has been calling on foreign regimes to produce dirt on his domestic opponents, the airport arrest of associates of the president’s lawyer as they tried to leave the country on one-way tickets, credible reports that Rudy Giuliani is under criminal investigation.
Alternatively, Barr could have delivered himself of some innocuous pablum, which is something government officials often do in difficult times.
But no. Barr gave a fiery speech denouncing the threat to America posed by “militant secularists,” whom he accused of conspiring to destroy the “traditional moral order,” blaming them for rising mental illness, drug dependency and violence.
Consider for a moment how inappropriate it is for Barr, of all people, to have given such a speech. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion; the nation’s chief law enforcement officer has no business denouncing those who exercise that freedom by choosing not to endorse any religion.
And we’re not talking about a tiny group, either. These days, around a fifth of Americans say that they don’t consider themselves affiliated with any religion, roughly the same number who consider themselves Catholic. How would we react if the attorney general denounced Catholicism as a force undermining American society?
And he didn’t just declare that secularism is bad; he declared that the damage it does is intentional: “This is not decay. It is organized destruction.” If that kind of talk doesn’t scare you, it should; it’s the language of witch hunts and pogroms.
It seems almost beside the point to note that Barr’s claim that secularism is responsible for violence happens to be empirically verifiable nonsense. America has certainly become less religious over the past quarter century, with a large rise in the number of religiously unaffiliated and growing social liberalism on issues like same-sex marriage; it has also seen a dramatic decline in violent crime. European nations are far less religious than we are; they also have much lower homicide rates and rarely experience the mass shootings that have become almost routine here.
Nonetheless, William Barr — again, the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, responsible for defending the Constitution — is sounding remarkably like America’s most unhinged religious zealots, the kind of people who insist that we keep experiencing mass murder because schools teach the theory of evolution. Guns don’t kill people — Darwin kills people!
So what’s going on here? Pardon my cynicism, but I seriously doubt that Barr, whose boss must be the least godly man ever to occupy the White House, has suddenly realized to his horror that America is becoming more secular. No, this outburst of God talk is surely a response to the way the walls are closing in on Trump, the high likelihood that he will be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Trump’s response to his predicament has been to ramp up the ugliness in an effort to rally his base. The racism has gotten even more explicit, the paranoia about the deep state more extreme. But who makes up Trump’s base? The usual answer is working-class whites, but a deeper dive into the data suggests that it’s more specific: It’s really evangelical working-class whites who are staying with Trump despite growing evidence of his malfeasance and unsuitability for high office.
And at a more elite level, while a vast majority of Republican politicians have meekly fallen in line behind Trump, his truly enthusiastic support comes from religious leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr., who have their own ethical issues but have called on their followers to “render to God and Trump.”
Patriotism, Samuel Johnson famously declared, is the last refuge of scoundrels. But for all his talk of America first, that’s not a refuge that works very well for Trump, with his subservience to foreign autocrats and, most recently, his shameful betrayal of the Kurds.
So Trump is instead taking shelter behind bigotry — racial, of course, but now religious as well.
Will it work? There is a substantial minority of Americans with whom warnings about sinister secularists resonate. But they are a minority. Overall, we’re clearly becoming a more tolerant nation, one in which people have increasingly positive views of others’ religious beliefs, including atheism.
So the efforts of Trump’s henchmen to use the specter of secularism to distract people from their boss’ sins probably won’t work. But I could be wrong. And if I am wrong, if religious bigotry turns out to be a winning strategy, all I can say is, God help us.

Texto completo: Doce de los candidatos demócratas que se enfrentan para postularse como rival de Donald Trump en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 se enfrentan hoy en un debate celebrado en la Universidad de Otterbein, en Ohio.
El debate presidencial de los demócratas este lunes está organizado por la cadena CNN y el diario The New York Times y puede ser el último de cuatro de los candidatos. La cifra de candidatos es récord para un debate de este tipo . En el siguiente debate, el de noviembre, hasta cuatro de ellos podrán perder su oportunidad de enfrentarse en público a sus competidores.
Julián Castro, el único representante latino, es uno de ellos. A él se unen la representante hawaiana Tulsi Gabbard, la senadora de Minnesota Amy Klobuchar y el exrepresentante demócrata Beto O’Rourke. Si estos cuatro candidatos no se esfuerzan al máximo esta noche, probablemente no participen en el próximo debate.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House says President Donald Trump has yet to watch a graphically violent parody video that depicts a likeness of him shooting and stabbing opponents and members of the news media, but based on what he's heard, he "strongly condemns" it.
The parody was shown at a meeting of Trump supporters at his Miami resort.
The video portrays Trump's critics and media members as parishioners in a church fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organization logos.
Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body. Among the targets: former President Barack Obama, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.
White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham says in a tweet that Trump will see the video shortly and that, "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video."
The video and its screening were first reported by The New York Times.
The "unauthorized video" was shown last week "in a side room" at an American Priority conference at Trump's Doral Miami resort, the event's organizer, Alex Phillips, said in a statement.
"This video was not approved, seen, or sanctioned" by the event's organizers, Phillips said.
Russia's Putin visits Saudi Arabia on Mideast trip
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Russian President Vladimir Putin traveled to Saudi Arabia on Monday, meeting with the oil-rich nation's king and crown prince as he seeks to cement Moscow's political and energy ties across the Mideast.
Putin received all the trappings of a state visit, with a mounted guard escorting his limousine to King Salman's Al-Yamamah palace in Riyadh on his first visit to the kingdom since 2007.
In the intervening years, the Arab Spring roiled the wider Mideast as Putin would partner with Iran in backing Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's still-raging war. Saudi Arabia unsuccessfully backed those trying to oust Assad.
But more recently, Russia joined OPEC in lowering their production beginning in 2017, the first such cut for the cartel in a decade.
Officer who shot naked man found not guilty of murder
DECATUR, Ga. - A former police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked man was found not guilty of murder Monday but was convicted of aggravated assault and other charges that could send him to prison for more than 30 years.
Robert "Chip" Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly as the verdict was read. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the courtroom.
Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Texas prison guard acquitted in death of inmate he threw down
ANGLETON, Texas - A jury has acquitted a former Texas prison guard who slammed a handcuffed inmate to the ground so hard that the man's liver ruptured and he died.
The Houston Chronicle reports that Lou Joffrion was acquitted last month on aggravated assault charges in the 2017 death of David Witt, who had mental health issues.
Authorities say Joffrion, who was a sergeant at the Darrington Unit in Brazoria County south of Houston, picked up the 128-pound Witt and slammed him to the ground after Witt refused orders to return to his cell.
Joffrion's lawyer defended the use of force, saying whether it was excessive is "subjective."
Jennifer Erschabek of the Texas Inmate Families Association called the verdict "legalized brutality."
Protests erupt as Spain convicts separatists
BARCELONA, Spain - Riot police engaged in a running battle with protesters outside Barcelona's airport Monday after Spain's Supreme Court convicted 12 separatist leaders of illegally promoting the wealthy Catalonia region's independence and sentenced nine of them to prison.
Police fired foam bullets and used batons against the thousands of protesters who converged on Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat Airport after a pro-independence grassroots group put out the call. Protesters fought back by throwing objects, spraying dark clouds with fire extinguishers, and breaking windows.
Regional emergency service SEM said 53 people were treated for injuries at the airport.
Police also clashed with angry crowds late Monday night in downtown Barcelona.
Hong Kong police say bomb targeted its officers
HONG KONG - A homemade, remote-controlled bomb intended to "kill or to harm" riot control officers was detonated as they deployed against renewed violence in Hong Kong over the weekend, police said Monday, in a further escalation of destructive street battles gripping the business hub.
The "loud thud" Sunday night close to riot officers who had been clearing away a protester-built roadblock marked the first known use of an explosive during protests that started in June.
But despite spiraling violence, widespread vandalism and gasoline-bomb attacks by black-clad, hard-core protesters - and repeated government appeals for people not to take their side - the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators.
Dossier tell-all: The co-founders of a political research firm behind allegations about President Donald Trump's ties to Russia are writing a book.
Random House announced Monday that "Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump" will be published Nov. 26. The book was co-written by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch.
Random House is calling "Crime in Progress" a "never-before-told inside story" about Trump and Russia and the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.
Fusion GPS helped compile the dossier, by former British spy Christopher Steele.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The White House on Monday said President Donald Trump "strongly condemns" a gruesome fake video that depicts him shooting members of the news media and political rivals and was shown at his Florida resort.
Aides said he had not seen the graphically violent parody video and planned to view it "shortly" Monday morning.
"Re: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video," the White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, tweeted Monday morning.
Mr. Trump, who tweeted about other topics Monday - including wishing his former press secretary good luck on his Monday evening "Dancing With the Stars" appearance - has not mentioned or condemned the video himself.
The video was played at a conference for Trump supporters at Trump National Doral Miami last week. The New York Times obtained footage of the video, which the event organizer, American Priority, said was part of a "meme exhibit." The group said the video was not "approved, seen or sanctioned" by the conference organizers, and it criticized The Times for focusing on the video and not on any of the other events, "including our panel conversation LITERALLY condemning political violence."
Mr. Trump regularly lashes out at the news media and dismisses coverage critical of his policies as "fake news."
While Mr. Trump did not address the video specifically Monday morning, he did take aim at one of his favorite political targets who was among those featured in the video - Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Schiff is one of three committee chairmen overseeing an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
The video appears to be adapted from 2014 dark comedy film "Kingsman: The Secret Service" and portrays the inside of the "Church of Fake News." A character with a superimposed image of Mr. Trump's head on a body opens fire in the church. The parishioners have the faces of his critics or the logos of media organizations.
One of the president's sons, Donald Trump Jr., was at the conference, where he spoke Sunday about social media networks and claimed they censor him and his father. His spokesman said he had not seen the video.
Former press secretary Sarah Sanders also spoke at the conference. She said she was not aware of the video and was at the conference to speak about unity. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke at the conference as well, and his spokeswoman said the governor had not seen the video.
On Monday, someone identifying as Carpe Donktum, owner of "MemeWorld," a website of pro-Trump memes, said one of the sites contributors, TheGeekzTeam, created the video. TheGeekzTeam describes itself as "a red blooded American with ZERO tolerance for the liberal agenda. Trump 2020!!!"
TheGeekzTeam has been a prolific meme-maker for several years, posting videos with titles like "Captain MAGA" and "Trump: The Punisher" to YouTube and to r/the_donald, a large pro-Trump forum on Reddit. The video shown at the American Priority meeting was first posted on YouTube in July 2018.
Earlier this year, the account began contributing to MemeWorld, a centralized meme repository organized by Logan Cook, who goes by the name "Carpe Donktum" online.
Mr. Cook's website acts as a clearinghouse for offensive memes and videos, which often depict Mr. Trump as a crusader or superhero who uses violence to suppress news outlets, journalists and opponents.
On Monday, Mr. Cook's site posted a statement defending TheGeekzTeam, claiming the video showing Mr. Trump shooting, stabbing and punching his foes was "clearly satirical."
Among Carpe Donktum's Twitter followers are Mr. Trump Jr.; Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., an avid supporter of the president; Brad Parscale, campaign manager for Trump 2020; and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director.
The Twitter account was suspended Monday afternoon.

The New York Times smears Tulsi Gabbard as an alt-right Russian stooge

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard is a progressive, Samoan American woman, and Democratic candidate for president. But apparently we’re supposed to believe she’s also a Russian stooge and alt-right figurehead.
On Oct. 12, the New York Times published an absurd hit piece — as a “news” article, not opinion — lambasting Gabbard and grossly distorting her candidacy. It’s apparent from the incredulous, not objective headline: “What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?” and the subhead of the article, which reads: “As she injects chaos into the 2020 Democratic primary by accusing her own party of ‘rigging’ the election, an array of alt-right internet stars, white nationalists and Russians have praised her.”
Woah. We’re not even 100 words in, and the Times is already linking Gabbard, a woman of color, to Nazis and Russia?!?
It gets worse. What’s their evidence of the Hawaii congresswoman’s supposed far-right ties? Apart from cherry-picking a few fringe figures who support her, the Times cites the following:
On podcasts and online videos, in interviews and Twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard. They like the Hawaiian congresswoman’s isolationist foreign policy views. They like her support for drug decriminalization. They like what she sees as censorship by big technology platforms.
Huh? It’s frankly astounding that a journalist, Lisa Lerer, at a newspaper like the Times would cite supporting drug decriminalization as evidence that someone panders to the alt-right. If anything, opposing the failed war on drugs is a position true liberals often hold, and even if you disagree with Gabbard’s call to decriminalize marijuana under federal law, it’s certainly not evidence of ties to or sympathy for the alt-right.
As far as her “isolationist” foreign policy is concerned, it’s a stretch to draw a straight line from non-interventionism to racism. For one, that would mean half the country is secretly racists. Polls show that half of Americans think the president should use military force less often, and only 20% support more attempts at regime-change wars, the foreign policy Gabbard most frequently rails against.
Is everyone who disagrees with liberal hawks and neoconservatives on foreign policy a white nationalist in the estimation of the New York Times? That’s what the article implies, even though it makes little sense — I'd personally tend to think the foreign policy worldview that involves killing fewer brown people in the Middle East isn't racist, but that's just me.
What, Exactly, is Tulsi Gabbard Up To - A Response
Additionally, the Times quotes one “expert” who says Gabbard has “the seal of approval” from white nationalists. Even if this is true, so what? The anti-Semitic alt-right loves Rep. Ilhan Omar for her criticisms of Israel. But something tells me the Times (rightly) won’t use that as evidence that the left-wing Muslim woman of color is secretly alt-right.
Fringe figures are going to support somebody, and Gabbard has denounced their support in no uncertain terms. No one can point to any actual racism in Gabbard’s record, so this amounts to little more than a vicious smear of a candidate who dares stray from mainline Democrat orthodoxy.
And ultimately, critics aren’t shy that this is what has earned Gabbard their ire. The Times quotes Democratic Party flak and ex-Hillary Clinton shill Neera Tanden, who blasts Gabbard, saying, “She’s taken a series of policy steps which signal to the right that she has deep areas of alignment.”
Tanden provides no examples. Yes, it’s true that Gabbard opposes radical policies such as third-term abortion and open borders (she also supports liberal policies like "Medicare for all" and gun control). Is the Democratic media and establishment admitting that holding such commonsense, mainstream positions now makes you a right-winger?
Of course, what would a good liberal media smear be without an invocation of something something Russia.
The Times article suggests that Gabbard’s campaign is backed by Russia, and hints that something about her must be appealing to Putin, or something. This suggestion, as journalists like to say these days, is without evidence.

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Additional reading
What have we learned about the Lakers? A couple takeaways from preseason play so far, especially if Anthony Davis doesn’t play until the regular season. The tricky nature of China: I originally intended to write about how China is an economic force for the NBA — but the story quickly changed.
Kyle Kuzma’s off-court growth: The third-year star sounded off on his shoe deal, changing agencies, and handling trade deadline pressures. Tension broken: The Lakers and Nets were able to showcase why the NBA has some leverage in the China tussle. Leaving with some uncertainty: The last exhibition in China showed the Lakers’ fatigue, and left Davis on the injury report. China’s hardball playbook: The New York Times covered how the NBA’s reluctance to speak out on China is a problem for many foreign companies. Running up against communism : Sam Amick of The Athletic pointed out that former commissioner David Stern saw the issue coming. An authoritarian stamp: Seerat Sohi at Yahoo spoke to experts on China about the government’s strategy for dealing with opposition. The way forward: Tom Ziller from Bleacher Report theorizes the two ways the NBA and China could move ahead in their relationship.

Texto completo: La Casa Blanca condenó un video falso en el que el presidente Donald Trump aparece matando a sus críticos.
Las imágenes fueron enseñadas el fin de semana a seguidores del mandatario en un hotel de su propiedad en Doral, en el área de Miami. Allí fue donde el grupo pro Trump American Priority celebró una conferencia de tres días.
El video es una parodia que toma imágenes de la película de 2014 Kingsman: The Secret Service . Imágenes de los rostros de Trump y sus críticos son sobrepuestas sobre las originales para recrear la escena de la masacre en una iglesia.
Entre las personas que Trump mata, ya sea a balazos, con cuchillos o con sus propias manos, están el fallecido John McCain, el candidato a la presidencia Bernie Sanders, la congresista Maxine Walters, y la exsecretaria de Estado Hillary Clinton, quien no podía faltar en algo relacionado con la ira de Trump. También aparecen los logos de CNN, The Washington Post, Politico y NPR , medios vistos como productores de noticias falsas por parte de Trump y sus seguidores.
Stephanie Grisham , secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, dijo que el presidente no ha visto el video pero que condena ese tipo de contenido.
Re: the video played over the weekend: The @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has not yet seen the video, he will see it shortly, but based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video.
— Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) October 14, 2019
Asociaciones de periodistas también condenaron el video y recordaron que la retórica violenta del presidente es la causante de este tipo de sucesos. Por si parte, Cindy McCain, viuda del exsenador republicano, dijo que las imágenes “violan todas las normas que la sociedad espera de sus líderes”.
Reports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage
— Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) October 14, 2019
El grupo American Priority se desentendió del asunto y dijo al New York Times que el video no fue aprobado por los organizadores de la conferencia.

Curb Cost Of Health Care

Texto completo: American health care is by far the most expensive in the world. It accounts for about 18 percent of the entire economy and costs more than $10,000 per person every year.
Now, a major study published Oct. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association has concluded that between 20% and 25% of that spending is wasteful.
In terms of money, that is about $760 billion every year, roughly equal to the cost of the Medicare program, more than the entire U.S. defense budget and comparable to total spending nationwide on public education.
The study, conducted by researchers for the University of Pittsburgh and the health insurer Humana, analyzed 54 academic studies on health care waste that have been conducted since 2012. They concluded that the single largest source of wasteful health care spending, about $266 billion per year, is in the area of administration - the vast system for billing and reporting among health care providers and public and private health insurers.
Don Berwick, a physician and senior fellow at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, told The New York Times that much of that administrative waste could be resolved by moving to a single-payer system.
“What stands in the way of reducing waste, especially administrative waste and out-of-control prices, is much more a lack of political will than a lack of ideas about how to do it,” he said.
The second-leading area of wasteful spending is in pricing, the study found, in the amount of more than $230 billion a year. That could be resolved through true competition rather than the ongoing wave of consolidated regional health monopolies, or by the sort of health care price controls that governments impose in most other developed countries, or both.

Furor Over New Jersey Jail Detaining Immigrants

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
In 2011, lawmakers in Essex County, N.J., agreed to house detained immigrants at the local jail in exchange for what would eventually add up to around $ 200 million from the federal government. Across the country, hundreds of other local communities were shoring up their budgets with similar deals.
But that decision has turned into an unexpected source of tension as critics who oppose President Trump's immigration policies have pressured the county to end to the contract. Protesters regularly amass outside the Essex County Correctional Facility carrying "Abolish ICE" signs. Activists pack public meetings demanding the county pull out of the agreement.
Lawmakers in the county, a longtime Democratic stronghold in one of the bluest regions in the nation, are now caught between their reliance on steady income from the federal government and anger from a more activist left.
"The failure of New Jersey Democrats is a microcosm of the larger Democratic Party to take any bold stand on immigrant rights," said Whitney Strub, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University and a local activist.
The ire has increased this year, after government reports detailed what inspectors called egregious conditions at the jail. Chicken blood was dripping over food in a refrigerator; inmates were eating moldy bread and slimy, foul-smelling lunch meat; and an officer's gun was left unattended in a bathroom. Separately, the Essex County prosecutor is investigating allegations that guards stripped two immigrants and beat them this year.
Essex County lawmakers, who say they have improved conditions at the jail, point to pragmatics. The county receives a day rate for each detainee it holds, which last year totaled about $ 35 million. It now houses about 800 immigrants in addition to its regular population.
"Government cannot fund itself entirely on property taxes, so it is important that government find other sources of revenue," Joseph N. DiVincenzo Jr., the Essex County executive and one of the most powerful Democrats in northern New Jersey, said in a statement. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
Nearly 200 jails nationwide, including in nearby Hudson and Bergen Counties, have similar agreements to hold people who have been arrested by federal immigration authorities. A few counties in California, North Carolina and Texas have ended contracts with the federal government after protests.
Officials in Hudson County, which received about $ 27 million to house immigrants in its jail in 2018, reluctantly agreed to end their contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year after local religious leaders filed a lawsuit and a protest outside the county jail grew so large it nearly stirred a riot inside.
But Essex County has resisted similar calls, despite its deep Democratic ties. The jail is in Newark, the home of Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate who has proposed to virtually eliminate immigration detention. A spokeswoman for Mr. Booker did not respond to requests for comment on the federal detention contract.
Mr. DiVincenzo has argued that the agreement is better for immigrant communities. Being detained in Newark means people can stay closer to their families and more lawyers who are equipped to handle their cases, his administration has said.
The Essex County jail holds one of the largest immigrant populations among county jails nationwide, and it has repeatedly been singled out by federal authorities for poor conditions.
In March 2016, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at the Department of Homeland Security conducted an investigation into the jail, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times.
The report, which has never been released publicly, found that immigrants were not being given medication for chronic illnesses for days after they arrived and that they were using plastic trash bags to microwave food purchased from the commissary. Inspectors also noted that the jail's satellite kitchens, showers and dormitories were covered in dust and dirt, posing a health risk.
The department's internal watchdog released an additional report this year detailing conditions found on a surprise visit in July 2018, including dilapidated, moldy infrastructure and rotting food. The kitchen manager, who worked for a private contractor, was fired on the spot.
Jail officials told The Times on a tour there this year that the problems were immediately resolved after the visit from inspectors.
"We are proud of our proactive approach to meet the needs of our detainees and the high standards of care that we have set for our facility," Al Ortiz, the director of the Essex County jail, said after the report came out in February.
In recent interviews, immigrants detained at the jail and lawyers who represent them disputed that the situation had improved.
The inmate who found the loaded weapon in the bathroom, who has since been deported to the United Kingdom, said that after he reported his discovery, he was removed from his job on cleaning duty as punishment.
Demosthenes Gumalo, a 58-year-old immigrant from the Philippines who was released from the jail in February, said "everything stayed the same" after the inspectors' visit. "We still had stomach pains sometimes, diarrhea, the food was still bad," he added. "I couldn't eat it."
This summer, the jail fell under more scrutiny after two immigrants, José Hernandez and Wilson Peña, said they had been beaten by corrections officers in May. The men were transported to a hospital for treatment, their medical records show.
The episode started when Mr. Hernandez began to argue with an officer who would not give him a lunch tray, the men said. As officers beat Mr. Hernandez, Mr. Peña objected from behind glass in a nearby section of the jail, Mr. Peña said. The two men were then taken to an intake area, where Mr. Hernandez was put in a shower, beaten, pepper-sprayed and doused in hot water, he said.
Mr. Peña said he was then stripped and beaten. "I thought I was going to die with each punch," he told The Times in a phone interview.
Both men were later taken to University Hospital in Newark. Their medical records show that they had signs of post-traumatic stress disorder as well as pain in their joints, backs, necks and chests.
They were returned to the Essex County jail within hours, where they say they were placed in solitary confinement for nearly a month.
An internal investigation at the jail found that the claims were unsubstantiated. The Essex County prosecutor's office has since opened its own investigation. Jail officials declined to comment on that inquiry.
The allegations and the federal reports landed at an opportune political moment for those calling for an end to the detention contracts. Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who took office last year, has tried to position the state as a liberal bulwark against the White House. While he has not commented on the contracts, his broader stance against Mr. Trump has put pressure on local Democrats to respond to criticism from left-leaning advocates.
Still, in Essex County, only one local legislator, Brendan W. Gill, has called publicly to end the deal with the federal government. In July, the county renewed its contract with G.D. Correctional Services, the food provider that had been cited by federal inspectors. All but two of the county's nine legislators voted in favor of renewing the contract.
Activists say their calls for increased accountability have been repeatedly blocked by Mr. DiVincenzo's administration and ignored by other legislators who are reluctant to challenge a figure so powerful in local Democratic politics.
Mr. DiVincenzo's office has defended his interaction with advocates, saying that he is open to the creation of a civilian body to examine the jail. He has agreed to allocate $ 750,000 from the county budget to provide free legal services to immigrant detainees there.
That has not pacified critics, who accuse the county of profiting from immigration policies they see as unjust.
"There is no way to defend this contract anymore," said Kathy O'Leary, regional coordinator at Pax Christi, a Roman Catholic peace movement.

Texto completo: "Joker" left room for the arrival of another, less violently somber movie (with similarly strong Halloween costume potential): "The Addams Family."
It was a good weekend for gloom.
Warner Bros. continued to rake in money with the grave supervillain origin story "Joker," which topped the domestic box office Friday through Sunday with an estimated $ 55 million in ticket sales. The movie picked up an additional $ 123.7 million overseas this weekend according to the studio, bringing its worldwide cumulative tally to about $ 543.9 million after only its second weekend in theaters.
The R-rated "Joker," which stars Joaquin Phoenix, also left room for the arrival of another, less violently somber movie (with similarly strong Halloween costume potential): "The Addams Family." That animated film opened to about $ 30.3 million in ticket sales this weekend, landing it in second place, above prerelease expectations.
"The Addams Family," distributed in the United States by United Artists Releasing, offers a new take on the macabre comics by Charles Addams. Following in the footsteps of past "Addams Family" adaptations, the computer-animated comedy begins its story with the wedding of Gomez (voiced in this version by Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron). The plot involves the pair making their home in an abandoned asylum in New Jersey and, years later, confronting a planned-community development that encroaches on the family's deliberately spooky surroundings. The voice cast also includes Allison Janney, Chloë Grace Moretz, Finn Wolfhard, Bette Midler and Snoop Dogg.
"The Addams Family" was a hit despite lackluster reviews: it currently holds a 44 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In his review for The New York Times, Ben Kenigsberg wrote that the movie "has just enough wit and weirdness to honor its source material."
[Read our critic's review of "The Addams Family."]
In third place was Paramount's action thriller "Gemini Man," which opened to around $ 20.5 million in domestic sales according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. That is a letdown given that the movie stars Will Smith, and was directed by Ang Lee. It also cost a reported $ 138 million to produce.
"Gemini Man" cast Smith as a retired sniper being hunted by his younger clone, whose appearance is achieved through digital effects. The movie currently holds a 26 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, an unenthusiastic critical response that might have veered audiences looking for star power and violent action toward "Joker," which sits at 68 percent.
Rounding out the top five were Universal's "Abominable," which made around $ 6.2 million during its third weekend in theaters and "Downton Abbey," distributed by Focus Features, which was in its fourth weekend and sold around $ 4.9 million in tickets. Lionsgate's "Jexi," a comedy starring Adam Devine that opened this weekend, landed further down the ranks with roughly $ 3.1 million in ticket sales.

Texto completo: Donald Trump promised struggling working-class voters that he heard their frustrations and would act.
He did: He pushed through a tax cut that made income inequality worse . In 2018, for the first time, the 400 richest U.S. households paid a lower average tax rate than any other income group, according to new research by two economists.
Those billionaires paid an average total rate of 23% in 2018, down from the 70% their 1950 counterparts paid. Meanwhile, the bottom 10th of households paid an average of 26%, up from 16% in 1950.
That’s the rot in our system: Great wealth has translated into immense political power, which is then leveraged to multiply that wealth and power all over again — and also multiply the suffering of those at the bottom. This is a legal corruption that Trump magnified but that predated him and will outlast him; this is America’s cancer.
We hear protests about “class warfare” and warnings not to try to “soak the rich.” But as Warren Buffett has observed: “There’s class warfare, all right. But it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”
The infuriating data on tax rates, reported a few days ago by my colleague David Leonhardt, come from a new book, “The Triumph of Injustice,” by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. The class warfare against struggling Americans has unfolded in many dimensions aside from tax policy — factory closings and lack of job retraining, corporate greed and irresponsibility, assaults on labor unions, stingy social welfare, mass incarceration and so on — and we’ve seen the results in rising “deaths of despair” from drugs, alcohol and suicide. America’s richest men now live almost 15 years longer than the poorest men — roughly the same gap in life expectancy as exists between the U.S. and Nigeria.
As a society, instead of playing Robin Hood to smooth out the inequities, we’ve played the Sheriff of Nottingham. Lawrence Summers, the economist and former Treasury secretary, has calculated that if we had the same income distribution today as we had in 1979, the bottom 80% would have about an extra $1 trillion each year and the top 1% would have about $1 trillion less.
Instead, each household at the top has averaged an annual bonus of more than $700,000 a year.
One of the most consequential political debates in the coming years will be whether to raise taxes on the wealthy. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has suggested returning to a 70% marginal income tax rate, and both Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed taxes on wealth in addition to income.
Two MIT economists, Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, demolish the traditional arguments against higher taxes on the wealthy in an incisive book coming out next month, “Good Economics for Hard Times.” While major league sports teams have salary caps that limit athletes’ pay, Banerjee and Duflo note that no one argues “that players would play harder if only they were paid a little (or a lot) more. Everybody agrees that the drive to be best is sufficient.”
Considerable evidence suggests that the same is true of CEOs, and that higher tax rates don’t depress effort. In Switzerland, a shift in tax timing meant that the Swiss were not taxed for one year. This tax holiday, which they knew of in advance, turned out to have no impact on how hard people worked, Banerjee and Duflo write.
“High marginal income tax rates, applied only to very high incomes, are a perfectly sensible way to limit the explosion of top wealth inequality,” Banerjee and Duflo write.
There are legitimate concerns about tax evasion, but it would help if the IRS focused its audits less on impoverished Americans claiming the earned-income tax credit and more on wealthy people with murky assets. It’s ridiculous that the county in all America with the highest audit rate is Humphreys County, Mississippi, which is poor, rural and three-quarters black.
As for the wealth tax, which in Warren’s version would begin at $50 million, there are legitimate concerns about how to value assets, avoid marriage penalties and enable zillionaires to pay when their wealth is illiquid. But we already have a wealth tax — the property tax — that hits widows on Social Security with an illiquid asset (the family home). If these widows can figure it out, tycoons can as well.
Even if Trump disappeared tomorrow, we would still live in a country where the top 1% own more than the bottom 90% — and where on any given night more than 100,000 children are homeless.
By raising taxes on the wealthy, we could end the lead poisoning that afflicts half a million American children, we could provide high-quality preschool for all, we could offer treatment for all people with addictions and we could ensure that virtually all children graduate from a decent high school and at least get a crack at college.
The wealthy would still have more money than they could ever spend: Jeff Bezos would have had $87 billion in 2018 if Warren’s wealth tax had been in place all along, rather than $160 billion, according to calculations of Saez and Zucman. But we would be, I think, a fairer and better nation.
So should we soak the rich? You bet we should.

A new challenge

Texto completo: “An ambassador," said David Blatt.
That's what he'd do, might become, if he can't do this anymore, this game that has dominated his life and taken him to high places.
“I've always had the dream to be an ambassador, a diplomat in Israel. In some way I'd want to help the country."
Blatt, a dual US/Israeli citizen, is 60. His life has been about basketball, from the scruffy outdoor courts of Framingham, to Framingham South High, to Princeton, to the highly competitive overseas leagues.
And then when he had his fill of playing, Blatt grabbed clipboard and whistle and journeyed off to become one of the most successful European coaches ever. “He was known as the Phil Jackson of Europe," said Gary Bernson, Blatt's best friend and former high school teammate at South.
Blatt couldn't pull himself out of the gym. Any gym.
Now, he has been forced to.
Two months after announcing he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Blatt resigned earlier this week as coach of Greece-based Olympiacos Piraeus in the EuroLeague. Olympiacos had opened the season on Oct. 4. In a statement, he said “it's in the best interests of both sides to part ways [with the team]. My time in Greece with Olympiacos has been meaningful and significant in many ways."
In a release, the club said, “we've had the honor to work with one of the greatest figures in world basketball."
On Monday, in an e-mail, Blatt elaborated.
“I don't want to use my illness as an excuse, but in my discussions with management, I had to be honest about certain limitations I had," he said. “But more so, there were many problems in the team. We had only played one game. It did not start well. Together we sat and decided it was better for everyone that we part ways. No hard feelings.
“I'm looking forward to my next steps and challenges, as I have always wanted to do more. After 12 years as a professional player and 27 as a coach, time to enter a new phase of life. I relish it. Sometimes the window closes and the door opens."
Blatt, the father of four children, is approaching the disease the same way he went after every game he ever played or coached: eye to eye. He's on a new cycle of treatment. “No guarantees, it just came out," he said of the new treatment over the phone from Greece.
The constant of MS is fatigue, legs weakening, and faltering balance. The 6-foot-3 Blatt has always been a high-energy guy. It's the way he played and the way he coached.
“He was a pretty legit player as a freshman," recalled Phil “Smokey" Moresi, Blatt's high school coach at Framingham South.
“There was an aura about him, a cockiness. As a sophomore, he was a starter. The other four starters were seniors. He won them over by getting the ball to them." Blatt ran the show, up tempo.
Blatt's recent medical troubles began following back surgery in June 2018. He dutifully did his post-op physical therapy. Time went by. “But I didn't feel any improvement," he said. “I thought 'what's going on here?' " It was suggested he see a neurologist. He did. Tests proved out he had MS.
“There's been good days and less than good, but I'm happiest when I'm coaching." Now that's been taken away.
Blatt understands what he's up against, but please, no sympathy overtures. After the diagnosis he wrote an open letter to his team that emphasized “I am still the same person. Self-pity doesn't do anything but foster and encourage a downward side." He says he went back to his coaching methodology: “Find out the problem, why did it happen, how do we fix it?"
He had been working out with the team trainer, emphasizing aquatic exercise several times a week. “I'm not as quick and nimble as I used to be," he said. “I've got to be careful."
Bernson, who has visited Blatt in Israel, recalled a younger Blatt. “David was like Superman, always in shape. To see him like this is heartbreaking."
Added Moresi, “But he never complains. Every time I talk to him it's 'how you doing, coach?' He never says anything to worry me."
Blatt has been candid with his family on his condition and what to expect. “We've all educated ourselves about this. They're realistic," he said. “It's not life-threatening, in short distance." Still, the body breakdown is progressively debilitating, particularly ominous for someone like Blatt, who has always lived life in motion.
“He had told me he thought he could make it through this season," said Bernson. One game wasn't the plan. The team's statement called the decision to part ways with Blatt “consensual termination."
Moresi, who also coached at Ashland High and in college, had a profound effect on the career Blatt chose. “He taught me basketball and life lessons." Blatt was a star on Moresi's teams that ripped off a 58-game Bay State Conference winning streak.
“It was a great time in our lives," said Blatt.
Former Celtics standout Tom “Satch" Sanders was coaching Harvard when Blatt graduated from Framingham South. “He wanted David, but he'd already given [Princeton coach] Pete Carril his word," said Moresi.
Blatt played for the US national team that was twice crowned champion of the Maccabiah Games. In six seasons as Maccabi Tel Aviv coach, his record was 179-21. Blatt coached the Russian national team to a bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. While coaching Russia to a EuroBasket championship, Blatt was described in a New York Times story as “an American Jewish Israeli who coaches Russia."
Blatt's success abroad didn't get ignored back home. In the spring of 2014, he met with Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, expecting to sign a deal as an assistant. But at the last moment, the Cleveland Cavaliers breezed in with an offer as head coach. Blatt took it.
The Cavs advanced to the NBA finals in Blatt's first year, but lost to the Warriors, coached by Kerr. It was the first time two first-year coaches had made it to the NBA finals. Blatt received a congratulatory call from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Jan. 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired Blatt. The team was 30-11 at the time, the best record in the conference. Assistant coach Tyronn Lue took over and the ­LeBron James-led Cavaliers went on to win the NBA title. The team sent Blatt a championship ring. He was 83-40 as the Cavs' coach.
Blatt follows the NBA only casually. “Some of it is still a little painful," he said, “but I've got bigger challenges now." One of the joys is watching his son, 22-year-old Tamir, make a name for himself playing pro ball in Israel.
So that's David Blatt at 60. Work, hopefully, unfinished. Life to live. Life is work.

Texto completo: The assertiveness movement has taken a male-defined value system and sold it back to us as feminism.
If parents were giving their children virtue names today, as the Puritans used to do, nobody would choose Charity or Grace or Patience. Instead, half of all baby girls born in America would be named Empowerment or Assertiveness.
For women in this cultural moment, assertiveness is perhaps the ultimate in aspirational personal qualities. At the nexus of feminism and self-help lies the promise that if we can only learn to state our needs more forcefully -- to "lean in" and stop apologizing and demand a raise and power pose in the bathroom before meetings and generally act like a ladyboss (though not a regular boss of course; that would be unladylike) -- everything from the pay gap to mansplaining to the glass ceiling would all but disappear. Women! Be more like men. Men, as you were.
There are several problems with this fist-pumping restyling of feminism, most obviously that it slides all too easily into victim blaming. The caricature of the shrinking violet, too fearful to ask for a raise, is a handy straw-woman for corporations that would rather blame their female employees for a lack of assertiveness than pay them fairly.
There's also the awkward issue that it turns out to be untrue. Research shows that despite countless attempts to rebrand the wage gap as a "confidence gap," women ask for raises as often as men do. They just don't get them.
But even if we leave these narrative glitches aside and accept the argument that female unassertiveness is a major cause of gender inequality and that complex, systemic problems can be fixed with individual self-improvement, we are still left with a deeply sexist premise.
The assumption that assertiveness is a more valuable trait than, say, deference is itself the product of a ubiquitous and corrosive gender hierarchy.
As a rule, anything associated with girls or women -- from the color pink to domestic labor -- is by definition assigned a lower cultural value than things associated with boys or men. Fashion, for instance, is vain and shallow, while baseball is basically a branch of philosophy. Tax dollars are poured into encouraging girls to take up STEM subjects, but no one seems to care much whether boys become nurses. Girls are routinely given pep talks to be "anything a boy can be," a glorious promotion from their current state, whereas to encourage a boy to behave more like a girl is to inflict an emasculating demotion. Female hobbies, careers, possessions and behaviors are generally dismissed as frivolous, trivial, niche or low status -- certainly nothing to which any self-respecting boy or man might ever aspire.
"Women: Improve yourselves!" has always been a baseline instruction of both the world at large and the self-help movement. Take the whole "Women Who ..." subgenre, a surprisingly large range of books whose titles start with the words "Women Who ..." and end with a character flaw that then blames us for our own failure to be happy or successful. "Women Who Love Too Much," "Women Who Think Too Much," "Women Who Worry Too Much," "Women Who Do Too Much."
Rarely do we stop to consider that many of life's problems might be better explained by the alternative titles "Men Who Love Too Little," " ... Think Too Little," " ... Worry Too Little" or " ... Do Too Little." But instead we assume without question that whatever men are doing or thinking is what we all should be aiming for.
Now the assertiveness movement is taking this same depressingly stacked ranking system and selling it back to us as feminism. We in turn barely question whether the male standard really is the more socially desirable or morally sound set of behaviors or consider whether women might actually have had it right all along.
After all, one man's "assertive" is often another woman's abrasive, entitled or rude. Surely many of our most pressing social and political problems -- from #MeToo to campus rape, school shootings to President Trump's Twitter posturing -- are caused not by a lack of assertiveness in women but by an overassertiveness among men. In the workplace, probably unsurprisingly to many women who are routinely talked over, patronized or ignored by male colleagues, research shows that rather than women being underconfident, men tend to be overconfident in relation to their actual abilities. Women generally aren't failing to speak up; the problem is that men are refusing to pipe down.
Take apologizing, the patient zero of the assertiveness movement. Women do too much of it, according to countless op-ed essays, books, apps and shampoo ads. There's even a Gmail plug-in that is supposed to help us quit this apparently self-destructive habit by policing our emails for signs of excessive contrition, underlining anything of an overly apologetic nature in angry red wiggles.
The various anti-apologizing tracts often quote a 2010 study showing that the reason women say they are sorry more often than men is that we have a "lower threshold for what constitutes offensive behavior." This is almost exclusively framed as an example of female deficiency. But really, isn't a person with a "high threshold of what constitutes offensive behavior" just a fancy name for a jerk?
Rarely in the course of this anti-apologizing crusade do we ever stop to consider the social and moral value of apologies and the cost of obliterating them from our interactions. Apologizing is a highly symbolic and socially efficient way to take responsibility for our actions, to right a wrong and clear space for another person's feelings. It's a routine means of injecting self-examination and moral reflection into daily life.
Indeed, many of our problems with male entitlement and toxic behavior both in the workplace and elsewhere could well be traced back to a fundamental unwillingness among men to apologize, or even perceive that they have anything to apologize for. Certainly many emails I have received from men over the years would have benefited from a Gmail plug-in pointing out the apology-shaped hole. The energy we spend getting women to stop apologizing might be better spent encouraging men to start.
So perhaps instead of nagging women to scramble to meet the male standard, we should instead be training men and boys to aspire to women's cultural norms, and selling those norms to men as both default and desirable. To be more deferential. To reflect and listen and apologize where an apology is due (and if unsure, to err on the side of a superfluous sorry than an absent one). To aim for modesty and humility and cooperation rather than blowhard arrogance.
It would be a challenge, for sure. Pity the human resources manager trying to sell a deference training course to male employees. She would need to paint all the PowerPoint slides black and hand out Nerf guns just to get started. As long as the threat of emasculation is a baseline terror for men, encouraging them to act more like women still instinctively feels like a form of humiliation.
Which is exactly why we need to try, because until female norms and standards are seen as every bit as valuable and aspirational as those of men, we will never achieve equality. Promoting qualities such as deference, humility, cooperation and listening skills will benefit not only women but also businesses, politics and even men themselves, freeing them from the constant and exhausting expectation to perform a grandstanding masculinity, even when they feel insecure or unsure.
So H.R. managers and self-help authors, slogan writers and TED Talk talkers: Use your platforms and your cultural capital to ask that men be the ones to do the self-improvement for once. Stand up for deference. Write the book that teaches men to sit back and listen and yield to others' judgment. Code the app that shows them where to put the apologies in their emails. Teach them how to assess their own abilities realistically and modestly. Tell them to "lean out," reflect and consider the needs of others rather than assertively restating their own. Sell the female standard as the norm.
Perhaps some capitulation poses in the bathroom before a big meeting might help.

Anthony Davis sprains thumb, Lakers look tired in loss to Nets in China

Texto completo: The start of the sequence was something fans had been craving for months: As Anthony Davis corralled a defensive rebound, he sent an outlet pass sailing past the halfcourt line to a streaking LeBron James.
James ran under the rim for the lay-up … and missed it. He got his own rebound … and missed again right under the hoop.
Multiple blown lay-ups on one play is unusual to see from the 34-year-old star, but then again, it’s been an unusual trip.
Fatigue was the predominant trait of the Lakers in Saturday’s 91-77 loss to the Brooklyn Nets, the second of two exhibition games played under fraught geopolitical circumstances in China. The weight of international travel, atypical drama and playing their second game in three nights seemed to slow the Lakers down in Shenzhen: They scored just 36 points in the first half, looking listless against a Nets team that didn’t even suit up its best player, Kyrie Irving.
The most relevant portion of the night ended with some discouraging news: Davis, who made his first start at center in the team’s third preseason game, sprained his right thumb on a block. The Lakers ended up pulling him after one quarter, setting him up on the bench with a fresh wrap, and the new franchise centerpiece finished with just 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting.
The Lakers announced after the game that Davis would undergo diagnostic testing upon his return to Los Angeles, joining Kyle Kuzma, Quinn Cook and Jared Dudley as players who have been laid up with ailments recently.
No one else picked up the slack. James also played just one quarter, finishing with four assists and six points on 2-for-7 shooting including his misses near the basket. While team sideline reporter Mike Trudell shared that James spent much of the second half interacting with Chinese fans – thawing some of the chill that had set in earlier in the week between the NBA and the host country – he did little on the court to sate them.
The role players that have sparked some intrigue early did little to help blunt the impact of the star power outage. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Avery Bradley combined for 25 points, but required 25 shot attempts. Rajon Rondo, who started for the second consecutive game, had no assists and four turnovers in 16 minutes. JaVale McGee stood out in the first two exhibitions – on Saturday, he had a much more down-to-earth performance (9 points, 3 rebounds, 2 blocks). As a team, the Lakers shot just 33 percent, including 5 for 32 from 3-point range.
The small lineup with Davis at center struggled to create offense, but the Nets also struggled to score as well. After one quarter, a buzzer-beating 3-pointer by Alex Caruso had kept the Brooklyn lead to just 20-19 in a rock fight. While Davis has famously wished to play less center, he was a brutally efficient rim protector, getting a pair of blocks despite his injury.
Caris LeVert (22 points) helped pull Brooklyn back in pole position, putting on a well-rounded display after missing most of Thursday’s 114-111 Nets win that provided much more suspense. Taurean Prince added 14 points.
The Lakers were to fly back immediately Saturday, scheduled to reach Los Angeles late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. While the NBA decided Friday to not make media available for the rest of the trip, it seemed safe to assume the Lakers and the league welcomed the end of a whirlwind week that started with a flurry of outrage over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting in support of Hong Kong protests against the government.
The NBA has been under fire from both sides, as Chinese businesses pulled sponsorships and state-run television decided to blacklist the games. Back in the United States, the president was among the notable critics of the league for bowing to foreign interests. Shenzhen is just north of Hong Kong, giving rise to some concern that the Lakers’ second exhibition could have more tension than the first, but The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had asked the media and public to tone down the fiery rhetoric earlier in the week, soothing some of the angst.
The Lakers will play their first preseason game at Staples Center against the Golden State Warriors on Monday night. It’s unclear if any players will sit out on a short turnaround after a flight halfway across the globe.

'One sided witch hunt': Trump defends 'legendary' Giuliani amid reports he's under investigation

Texto completo: President Trump still has faith in Rudy Giuliani amid reports that the former New York City mayor is under investigation and despite speculation that the president might ditch him as his personal lawyer.
"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani," Trump said Saturday on Twitter. "He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!"
Tweet
The New York Times reported Friday that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether Giuliani violated lobbying laws in his work with Ukraine. Two Giuliani associates, who were helping him look into Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine, were arrested Wednesday on campaign finance-related charges. The two men were caught as they tried "to board an international flight with one way tickets," according to U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.
Giuliani denied he did anything wrong but admitted that he worked with the two men to try to find dirt on Hunter Biden.
The arrests follow an impeachment inquiry into President Trump regarding whether he tried to withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation into his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son Hunter.
Media has speculated that Trump might dump Giuliani, as Republican advisers have been telling the president in private to get rid of him. On Friday, the president indicated that he was unsure if Giuliani still represented him. Giuliani, however, stated that he believes he remains Trump's lawyer.

Texto completo: A doctor writes about the increasing number of people over 65 who are homeless.
To the Editor:
I was appalled to learn that four homeless New Yorkers were murdered recently while sleeping on the sidewalk ("Man's Deadly Rampage Illuminates the Perils of Living on the Street," news article, Oct. 7). When I read that one victim was 83 years old, my heart sank -- but I was not surprised.
I was part of a team of researchers who found that a crisis of aged homelessness is upon us and predicted to worsen. Our study found that shelter residents 65 and older in New York City reached 2,600 in 2017 and will top 6,900 by 2030. Nationally, we project there will be 106,000 homeless people aged 65 and older by 2030.
I'm an emergency room doctor at one of New York City's public hospitals. The same night as the murders, I saw homeless patients in their 60s and 80s. Caring for elderly homeless patients has become par for the course.
Will public outrage reach a tipping point and lead to action when more and more homeless people look like grandmas and grandpas? Or will we simply acclimate to the changing landscape of homelessness and the human suffering that accompanies it?

Texto completo: Facebook's troubled cryptocurrency initiative, Libra, suffered new blows on Friday as the departures of key partners became an exodus.
Stripe, Mastercard, Visa and eBay said they were all pulling out of Libra, a week after PayPal became the first company to drop out. While they continue to support the idea of Libra, the companies said, they will no longer be part of the coalition that is backing the effort.
"EBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member," a company spokesman said. Mastercard said it was focused on its own strategy "and our own significant efforts to enable financial inclusion around the world," and Visa said its future participation would depend, in part, on Libra's "ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations."
A spokesman for Stripe said, "We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage."
Also on Friday, federal regulators obtained a temporary restraining order against the encrypted-messaging company Telegram, moving to shut down its Gram cryptocurrency. The twin developments illustrated the continued fluidity around digital currencies, which are unregulated and are being closely scrutinized for how they might affect established financial systems.
Simon Taylor, a co-founder of 11:FS, a consulting firm that advises companies on blockchain adoption, said Facebook's and Telegram's difficulties "show just how important it is to have a clear position with regulators before launching at scale."
"Getting to a position of being regulated takes years of due diligence and hard work," he said. "This stuff isn't easy."
Libra has been met with doubts and questions almost from the moment that Facebook unveiled the effort in June.
At the time, the social network positioned Libra as the potential foundation for a new financial system that would not be directed by Wall Street or central banks. The cryptocurrency could be freely traded inside Facebook's properties, like Messenger and WhatsApp, and be used for international exchange, Facebook added.
As part of that, the social network said, it had more than 27 corporate partners -- including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and companies like Uber -- that had pledged to support the project. The partners are important because Libra will be controlled not by the social network but by a broad network of corporations, Facebook said.
Yet many world leaders, regulators and central bankers -- including President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- immediately criticized Libra and the idea of an unregulated currency. And they questioned whether Facebook, which is grappling with other regulatory issues around privacy and antitrust, should be heading up such an initiative.
In July, David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading Libra, faced two days of questioning in Congress about Libra. Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about Libra on Oct. 23.
Facebook declined to comment on Friday and referred questions to the Libra Association, a Swiss organization that the company created to oversee the project.
The Libra Association is "focused on moving forward and continuing to build a strong association," said Dante Disparte, its head of policy and communication. Even if the members change, he added, its underlying principles "will remain resilient." The group plans to hold a meeting on Monday in Geneva to formalize its membership.
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio on the Senate's banking committee, applauded the withdrawals of some of Facebook's partners from Libra.
"Large payment companies are wise to avoid legitimizing Facebook's private, global currency," Mr. Brown said. "Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolizing our economic infrastructure. I trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking."
The Libra coalition has been fraying for months. After Facebook announced the initiative, some of the partners began having second thoughts. Many were wary that Facebook's regulatory issues and the uncertain legality of cryptocurrencies might hurt Libra. Some of the companies, particularly payments providers, rely on good relationships with financial regulators.
The partners had signed nonbinding agreements, so backing out would be fairly easy, executives at seven of the partner companies told The New York Times in June. They also weren't obliged to use or promote the digital token.
"We will not do anything that we think doesn't meet our own personal standards, as well as the standards of regulators that we respect around the world," Al Kelly, Visa's chief executive, told CNBC this year.
In recent months, as skepticism around Libra was mounting, some of the partners realized the amount of resources they would have to commit to the effort was growing, said one person with knowledge of the situation, who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.
PayPal, which Mr. Marcus used to lead, said last week that it would leave the Libra initiative so it could instead "continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities."
On Friday, Mr. Marcus thanked Visa and Mastercard "for sticking it out until the 11th hour" and pointed to how intense the regulatory pressure had been. In posts on Twitter, he said people should not read too much into the withdrawals.
"Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating," he tweeted. "Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up."
Telegram, whose messaging platform is used by around 300 million people around the world, had also been making a push around its Gram cryptocurrency. The company began raising money for the project in late 2017. Its aim was to create a currency that could be sent anywhere in the world.
"A whole new economy saturated with goods and services sold for cryptocurrency will be born," the company said in a document sent to potential investors in 2017.
Unlike Libra, the Gram was supposed to operate without any central association or foundation, similar to Bitcoin. That structure gave many investors confidence that it could operate without the same regulatory restrictions as ordinary investments. As a result, some of Silicon Valley's biggest venture capital firms, including Benchmark, Lightspeed and Sequoia Capital, invested in the Gram. In total, Telegram took in $ 1.7 billion for it.
Telegram committed to delivering the Grams to investors by Oct. 31. But the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday that it was suing Telegram before it sent out the Grams to investors and asked for a restraining order.
The agency's lawsuit said the Gram should have been registered as an investment contract or security. Because it was not, the agency said, investors did not receive the proper disclosures and financial information. In the suit, the S.E.C. said Telegram should give back its "ill-gotten gains" and pay civil penalties.
"Our emergency action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the U.S. markets with digital tokens that we allege were unlawfully sold," Stephanie Avakian, a co-director of the S.E.C.'s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement.
A spokesman for Telegram did not respond to requests for comment.
Telegram has, in the past, ignored orders from the Russian and Iranian governments to shut down. It will now face the question of whether it wants to go forward despite the measures taken by the S.E.C.

Texto completo: Alfred Regnery, who built up the family publishing business into one of the conservative movement’s most influential voices, is getting back into books.
Regnery has teamed with longtime industry executive Eric Kampmann to launch Republic Book Publishers.
They plan to publish 12 “somewhat controversial and edgy” books a year and hope to develop new and young conservative writers, Regnery said.
Tweet
Regnery, who headed Regnery Publishing for years and was publisher of the American Spectator, had over two dozen New York Times best-sellers on his watch.
“Books make a difference,” he said, adding, “We know what we’re doing.”
They are already offering three books, including The Case Against Single Payer by Chris Jacobs.
Tweet
Republic will be a nonprofit company, akin to a university press. They are hosting a launch party this month.
The company is named in part for Plato’s Republic and Benjamin Franklin’s quip that the founding fathers hoped to create “a republic, if you can keep it.”

Texto completo: After the United States Anti-Doping Agency banned Alberto Salazar for four years, Nike stood by him.
Nike has decided to shut down its Oregon Project, the elite training group run for years by Alberto Salazar.
The move comes 10 days after Salazar was barred for four years from the sport of distance running for doping violations by the United States Anti-Doping Agency
The penalty stemmed from violations that included trafficking in testosterone, tampering with the doping control process and administering improper infusions of L-carnitine, a naturally occurring substance that converts fat into energy. Salazar has vowed to appeal the ban and just last week, Mark Parker, Nike's chief executive, announced that the company was standing behind Salazar, a marathon champion in his 20s and the leading figure in American distance running in the modern era.
In an internal letter released on Thursday, however, Parker explained that keeping the Oregon Project in operation during the appeal was no longer tenable. "The situation, along with the unsubstantiated assertions, is a distraction for many of the athletes and is compromising their ability to focus on their training and competition needs," he said.
Nike's decision to close the project was first disclosed by Bloomberg.
Parker stated that Nike would continue to fund Salazar's appeal. "A four-year suspension for someone who acted in good faith is wrong," Parker wrote.
Parker, however, is hardly a neutral source. According to emails cited in the decision from the American Arbitration Association upholding Salazar's four-year ban, exchanged between Salazar, Parker and Dr. Jeffrey Brown, a Houston endocrinologist the Oregon Project used to treat its athletes, Parker was looped in on experiments that were conducted to determine the amount of testosterone an athlete could absorb using a lotion without testing positive for the banned substance.
Parker said last week, also in a letter to employees, that the test was conducted because Salazar was concerned that rivals might sabotage his athletes after a race. USADA officials have disputed that explanation, saying that it is disingenuous and that the goal of the test was to determine how athletes could get away with cheating.
In an email to The New York Times on Saturday, Salazar denied ever giving testosterone to an active Oregon Project athlete.
Reacting to the news of the project's end, Travis Tygart, chief executive of USADA, said, "It is the right thing and now let's hope they accept that mistakes were made and truly commit to clean sport and the health, well-being of athletes."
The end of the Oregon Project is the latest development in a stunning downfall for Salazar and a fissure in one of the longest professional relationships of his life. Salazar has had a close relationship with Nike since he migrated to the Pacific Northwest from Massachusetts as a teenager to attend and run for the University of Oregon, alma mater of the Nike co-founder Phil H. Knight. Knight started the company that would become Nike with the famed Oregon coach Bill Bowerman shortly after graduating from Oregon, where he was a member of the track team.
Nike sponsored Salazar as a professional, when he won three consecutive New York City Marathons and became the world's top distance runner. His running career cratered in the mid-1980s as he battled injuries and depression. Salazar later became a sports marketing executive with Nike, and in 2001 founded the Oregon Project. The venture emulated other elite training groups that were popping up at the time, notably the Mammoth Lakes, Calif.-based Team Running U.S.A., but with far more money, access to Nike's scientific research labs, and with America's best-known distance runner at the helm.
The biggest stars of the Oregon Project were Galen Rupp, an Oregonian Salazar discovered when he was a teenage soccer star, and later, Mo Farah, the Somali-born Briton, who won four Olympic gold medals and then left the Oregon Project in 2017. Both Rupp and Farah have denied using performance enhancing drugs.
For more than a decade the Oregon Project operated largely in secrecy. The wall of silence began to break 10 years ago, when a Nike scientist called USADA to report suspicious testosterone levels in blood tests of Oregon Project athletes.
Three years later, an Oregon Project scientist and coach, Steve Magness, left and began to speak publicly about experiments with testosterone and L-carnitine infusions that were in excess of antidoping limits.
Kara Goucher, the former Olympian who trained with Salazar for seven years, spoke of how Salazar pushed athletes to take prescription drugs that were unnecessary but had side effects that might prove beneficial to endurance athletes. In testimony at his arbitration hearing, Salazar acknowledged distributing prescription drugs.
"I was a part of a culture that was so manipulative and so controlling and so wrong," Goucher said in an interview last week. "Your entire life is dependent on the power of this brand."
Even as Salazar absorbed the news of his ban and was ushered out of Doha, Qatar, where he was coaching athletes at the track and field world championships, many of his top runners resisted criticizing him.
"I am shocked to receive the news of today's ruling, especially during this time in which I am fully preparing for my next race in the world championships in Doha," Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands said in a statement last week. "This investigation is focused on the period before I joined the Oregon Project and therefore has no relation to me. I was aware of the ongoing investigations when I joined the team and have always had a clean conscience, knowing we are being monitored to the absolute fullest by USADA and WADA" -- the American and world antidoping authorities.
Suguru Osako, the Japanese distance runner who trained with the Oregon project, posted a message in Japanese on Twitter that expressed sadness that the team that made him stronger was going away. He said Nike had promised the same support as before and that there would be no hindrance to his training.
The decision to close the Oregon Project came on the eve of the elite athlete news conferences for the Chicago Marathon. Rupp, Jordan Hasay and Farah are scheduled to participate in the race and were going to have to face public questioning for the first time since the Salazar ban about their training and their former coach, questions that would surely follow them as long as the Oregon Project remained in operation.
As Parker, a runner himself, wrote to Nike employees, "Alberto can no longer coach while the appeal is pending."
"This situation, including uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions, has become an unfair burden for current Oregon Project athletes," a statement from Nike released Thursday night said. "That is exactly counter to the purpose of the team. We have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs. We will help all of our athletes in this transition as they choose the coaching set up that is right for them. We will continue to support Alberto in his appeal."

House Widens Inquiry With Subpoena for Perry

Texto completo: Hours after two associates of the president's personal lawyer were indicted on federal campaign finance charges, the House also subpoenaed them for depositions about their work in Ukraine.
WASHINGTON -- House investigators pounded the Trump administration and its allies on Thursday with new subpoenas, demanding documents from Rick Perry, the energy secretary, and testimony from two more witnesses as they aggressively challenged a White House pledge to starve their impeachment inquiry of evidence.
Three Democratic chairmen leading the inquiry instructed Mr. Perry to turn over by next Friday any records that would shed light on President Trump's attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open corruption investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son. Investigators also want answers on whether Mr. Perry tried to influence the management of Ukraine's state-owned gas company.
Hours earlier, they demanded that two businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, appear for depositions next Wednesday and hand over records related to their work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer. Mr. Giuliani has been the point man in the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine, around which the inquiry is centered. The subpoenas came shortly after the two men were indicted on federal campaign finance charges that touched on their work in Ukraine.
The new subpoenas, and more in the works, sent a clear message to the White House that Democrats do not intend to back down from a growing constitutional clash over their inquiry, even after the White House defiantly said this week that it would stonewall all requests for witnesses and documents.
Rather than waiting out the prolonged negotiations with witnesses that are typical in congressional oversight investigations, Democrats are demanding compliance on tight deadlines and threatening to draft an article of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress if his administration does not oblige.
In a letter to a lawyer for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, the three House chairmen wrote that as private citizens, the men were "required by law to comply with the enclosed subpoenas." It was signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee; and Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
"They may not evade requests from Congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry," the chairmen wrote. "They are not exempted from this requirement merely because they happen to work with Mr. Giuliani, and they may not defy congressional subpoenas merely because President Trump has chosen the path of denial, defiance and obstruction."
Still, significant questions remained open about which witnesses the House could secure.
Lawyers for the C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine prompted the inquiry appeared to be backtracking on earlier expectations that he would sit for an interview with members of Congress. Instead, they proposed a written question-and-answer exchange with the House Intelligence Committee, according to a person familiar with the matter.
And lawmakers awaited word from the State Department on whether it would try to block an interview scheduled for Friday with Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Trump removed after some of his allies concluded that she was impeding efforts to pressure the Ukrainians into opening investigations on Mr. Biden and other Democrats.
The latest subpoenas emerged as criticism of the president's actions in the Ukraine matter continued to grow and his defense team appeared to face a setback. Asked whether it was proper for the president to solicit foreign interference in the political process, H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, responded, "Of course it's not appropriate."
Speaking at an event in Washington on Thursday, Mr. McMaster said it was up to Congress "to make a judgment as to whether or not that happened."
At the White House, Mr. Trump questioned why lawmakers would want to talk to Mr. Perry. But he had told Republican lawmakers last week that Mr. Perry had encouraged him to make a much-scrutinized July phone call to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressured him to investigate political rivals, according to Axios.
"How many people can they talk to?" Mr. Trump said on Thursday. "We had a simple conversation."
Only a day after one of Mr. Trump's lawyers announced that Trey Gowdy, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, would join his private legal team to fight the House inquiry, the president told reporters that Mr. Gowdy actually could not start representing him until January, because of "lobbying rules."
Democrats are eyeing an accelerated timetable for their impeachment inquiry that could mean the entire process -- including a House vote to charge the president and a Senate trial -- could be almost over by January.
With the White House struggling to calibrate its response, Democrats have moved quickly to paper Mr. Trump's government with requests for information. The subpoena for Mr. Perry follows similar ones sent to the Defense and State Departments, the Office of Management and Budget, Vice President Mike Pence and the White House itself.
House investigators believe Mr. Perry may know about crucial exchanges between the United States and Ukraine in recent months. He led an American delegation to Mr. Zelensky's inauguration in May, and news reports have suggested he was aware of Mr. Giuliani's unusual role in shaping United States-Ukraine relations and may have been employed in Mr. Trump's pressure campaign.
"Recently, public reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president's stark message to the Ukrainian president," the chairmen wrote.
Mr. Perry had previously indicated that he would work to answer the House's questions, but the White House's "full halt" on cooperation, as the White House counsel put it in a letter sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, is likely to complicate that.
Mr. Parnas had been scheduled to appear for a deposition on Capitol Hill on Thursday and Mr. Fruman on Friday. But even before their arrests, their lawyer, John M. Dowd, had indicated that they would not comply voluntarily.
The subpoenas issued by the House Intelligence Committee to Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman make no mention of the federal indictment. The F.B.I. arrested the two men as they were about to board an international flight late Wednesday, and on Thursday federal prosecutors charged them with funneling foreign money to government officials and campaigns in an effort to influence American policy, including toward Ukraine.
The indictments could complicate congressional attempts to get them to testify, raising the issue of whether lawmakers will grant them immunity that would bar the use of their testimony as criminal evidence.
At the same time, an assertion of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination would be a lawful basis for the pair to avoid answering questions despite a subpoena.
The New York Times reported in May that the two men helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Ukrainian prosecutors who provided him information related to the investigations he wanted into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling to aid Democrats in the 2016 election.
The federal indictment in Manhattan made no mention of Mr. Giuliani, but stated that the men worked with one or more Ukrainian government officials to try to secure the removal of Ms. Yovanovitch as the United States' ambassador.
Mr. Giuliani was seeking Ms. Yovanovitch's removal, as well, and ultimately the White House called her back to Washington early, having deemed her insufficiently loyal to the president.
Other work by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman also appears to have overlapped with Mr. Perry's interest in the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz, which he raised during his May visit to the country.
House investigators are scheduled to hear from Ms. Yovanovitch on Friday in a private deposition, but as of late Thursday, it remained unclear if the State Department would try to block her testimony. Democrats were prepared to issue a subpoena to increase pressure if needed.
The indictment may also significantly complicate Mr. Giuliani's ability to serve as a face of the president's defense. Senate Republicans allied with the president have said they might host a public hearing with Mr. Giuliani in an effort to showcase his accusations against the Bidens and undercut the House's impeachment narrative. Now they may decide he is too toxic to expose to public questioning.

Texto completo: Alvin Singleton was a kid with access in the midtwentieth century close-knit Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of his childhood. "Where I grew up," he explains in an interview with Amsterdam News, "there were a lot of jazz musicians. I had friends in their families so I used to go to their rehearsals." That informal exposure became the foundation for what became Alvin Singleton's international career as an award-winning musical composer.
He studied music composition at New York University and Yale University and was a Fulbright Scholar in Rome. After returning to the U.S., after living in Europe for almost 15 years, he was Composer-in-Residence with the Atlanta Symphony, Detroit Symphony, Ritz Chamber Players and Spelman College. Singleton still spends much of his time in Atlanta.
Momenta Quartet will premiere Singleton's Chamber Music America-commissioned piece "Hallelujah Anyhow" at Americas Society in New York City on Oct. 15. It will be part of the fifth annual Momenta Festival, a series of four concerts with diverse programs curated by the members of Momenta Quartet. Admission is free, but reservations are strongly recommended.
Singleton's parents also played a significant role in his decision to become a musician. "They made me learn an instrument and I chose piano. Eventually, I learned to play jazz." Singleton's experience with jazz led to an interest in composing music. He enrolled in the New York College of Music (now part of NYU) where he began studying music composition. "I didn't really categorize myself. I had begun listening to classical pieces and I knew there were a lot of Black composers." Singleton joined the Society of Black Composers, which further fueled his fascination.
Singleton demurs when described as a composer of classical music. "I know that I write music. I'm a composer. So, categorization always gets us in trouble because it defines us very narrowly."
When asked to describe "Hallelujah Anyhow," he is characteristically reluctant to do so. "When people ask me about the titles for my pieces, I always say titles are for identification, not explanation. To know the music, you have to listen to it."
The process of composing "Hallelujah Anyhow" was unexpectedly interrupted by a health scare. Singleton shares, "This piece took quite a long time," he says, "because I had to have heart bypass surgery last year. It came out of nowhere because I didn't have a heart attack or anything, I just had a blockage."
He will, however, share his thoughts on some of his works that are relatively special to him. He has admitted that his "After Fallen Crumbs" was dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr. due to King's focus on helping the poor.
The prolific Singleton will also share that he is particularly proud of "Shadows," which he wrote for orchestra. "When I go back and examine it I see ideas that I was using that I didn't realize at the moment. When I go over early music, I see ideas that aren't fully developed because I was still developing. The more I write, the more I mature. In fact, I'm still developing even at this age."
Perhaps because of his special connection to "Shadows," Singleton has ventured to describe it in a past interview as, "An idea based upon different-sized spinning tops, each having its own little melody, and they intersect and shadow one another as the work develops."
The general acknowledgment that Black American culture is an integral part of U.S. culture itself is something Singleton is excited about. In part borne out by recent developments such as the announcement by The Met that it will present Terence Blanchard's opera based on New York Times columnist Charles Blow's memoirs "Fire Shut Up In My Bones," the first time in the storied institution's history that it will present an opera by a Black composer. The libretto is by writer and filmmaker Kasi Lemmons ("Eve's Bayou"). "I think it's about time, first of all," Singleton says. "Secondly, it's about the music. There are plenty of Black composers writing really good music but they don't get the opportunity to be invited to be composers. Slowly but surely Black culture is being recognized as true American culture. I can't imagine this country without Black people."

Texto completo: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced she's making several campaign stops this weekend in Ohio - including Toledo - ahead of the Democratic presidential primary debate next week outside Columbus.

Ms. Klobuchar's first meet and greet is at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at Plate One coffee shop in Toledo. Doors open at 10 a.m. at the restaurant on the ground floor of the Ohio Building at 420 Madison Ave. The business is owned by Toledo City Councilman Sandy Spang, an independent who has been courted by local Republicans.

She is also holding events in Cleveland and Dayton this weekend before her appearance Sunday at the Ohio Democratic Party State Dinner in Columbus, where she'll be joined by fellow 2020 candidates Pete Buttigieg, JuliÃ¡n Castro, Tim Ryan, and Tom Steyer.

Ms. Klobuchar, who's running as a moderate Democrat emphasizing a bipartisan record and ability to win over Republicans, is the second 2020 candidate to campaign in Toledo.

In July, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren held a rally here at a technical training center and talked about her trade plan.

Twelve candidates will take the stage Tuesday in the fourth Democratic primary debate, hosted by CNN and The New York Times, at Otterbein University in Westerville, a Columbus suburb that Democrats have underscored is turning blue - a trend they're hoping to maximize in the 2020 race.

Ms. Klobuchar's campaign said the Ohio visit will emphasize the importance of competing swing states in 2020.

Many have argued that Ohio has trended redder since President Trump's 2016 election and might be unwinnable for a Democrat. Recent polls show otherwise, with President Trump trailing the field's top Democrats in head-to-head matchups.

The Minnesota senator, who has won three landslide elections in her home state, has struggled to break out in the Democratic field, polling nationally at around 1 percent and raising under $5 million in the latest fund-raising quarter, well behind Ms. Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who each raised around $25 million.

Mr. Shakespeare goes to Washington

Texto completo: There is no word filled with more darkness and foreboding when used in reference to a Shakespeare play than “relevant.” What is a theatergoer to do when he takes his seat a few minutes before curtain, opens the program just given to him by a solicitous usher, and finds the portentous phrase “startlingly relevant to contemporary American audiences” etched like Belshazzar’s warning into the final paragraph of the director’s note?
Faced with the prospect of 3 1/2 hours of Shakespeare interpreted through yesterday’s New York Times editorial, does he scream? Does he stay to see medieval kings portrayed as Proud Boys, or does he run? Paralyzed by indecision, he vacillates between quietly slipping past the solicitous usher and preemptively throwing himself headfirst over the balcony. Too late! The lights go down as the sound of synthesizers fills the theater. He grips both arms of his chair.
Transplanting Shakespeare plays from their original historical context can be done well, but time-traveling productions, particularly for the history plays, have their work cut out for them. Directors risk going mad with the power this kind of flexibility grants them over the play’s text. Untethered from particular circumstances, characters deform, plots twist; William Shakespeare’s words crack and sometimes break beneath the burden of the director’s ambitions to make the play say something relevant (read: politically relevant) to contemporary audiences. Such is the case with the Folger Theatre’s production of Henry IV Part I, which ended its run at Washington, D.C.’s Folger Shakespeare Library this week, though thankfully less calamitously than the program note implied.
Director Rosa Joshi stages the story of the Percy family’s rebellion against Henry IV in an amorphous, cyberpunk dystopia. This setting distracts from other, far more interesting ambiguities inherent to the characters and themes of Henry IV Part I, the second play of Shakespeare’s so-called Henriad. Consisting of Richard II, Henry IV Parts I and 2, and Henry V, the Henriad relates the ascent of Henry of Monmouth, son of Henry IV, from an apparently ill-spent youth to his reign as Henry V, one of England’s most celebrated rulers. Revered for his victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt on St. Crispin’s Day, 1415. In Shakespeare, we first meet him as “Prince Hal” in Henry IV Part I.
Taken as a whole, the Henriad is a kind of meditation on leadership and power: How should a good leader act? What makes a good leader? Is all power corrupting? Shakespeare’s answers to these questions aren’t necessarily obvious. The characters of these plays and their circumstances are complicated, sometimes terribly or tragically so. As such, the flawed heroes and sympathetic villains defy easy classification along modern political fault lines. Such classification risks distorting the characters, simplifying and flattening them out.
The primary victim of this dynamic in the Folger production is the play’s titular king, Henry IV. In the director’s note, Joshi describes him as “authoritarian.” Just in case the audience doesn’t pick up on actor Peter Crook’s scowling and yelling, Joshi dresses him up in the uniform of an SS officer stationed on the Death Star. In doing so, she renders this difficult character cartoonish, at times even ridiculous. Near the play’s beginning, Crook’s Henry demands that several of his reluctant vassals kiss his hand before leaving. What difference his clothes make! A 15th-century king draped in purple might make such a demand and be taken seriously; a man dressed like a space fascist cannot. The scene makes Henry IV look weak, silly, and delusional.
The lesson of Joshi’s Henry IV seems to be that heavy-handedness and authoritarianism are expressions of weakness and breed terrible problems. The relevance of this reading of the play to our current political moment, from one view of things, is obvious and not worth elucidating. Certainly, Shakespeare is interested in tyranny and its repercussions, but interpreting Henry IV narrowly as a dispositional “authoritarian” misses half the story, one with sobering lessons for persons of any political persuasion, but particularly for those out of power.
Richard II, the play that proceeds Henry IV Part I in the Henriad, tells the story of how Henry Bolingbroke rose to the throne, overthrowing Richard II to become Henry IV. The play begins with conspicuous similarities to Henry IV Part I. A hot-headed young nobleman raises a problem to the king’s notice; the king’s subsequent bungling of that problem catalyzes an armed rebellion against him, led by the young nobleman. In Henry IV Part I, that hot-headed young nobleman is Henry “Hotspur” Percy; in Richard II, it’s Henry Bolingbroke himself.
Bolingbroke was arguably justified in usurping King Richard. But we also see that in Bolingbroke’s ascent to the throne, and in his subsequent labors to keep the throne, Henry IV finds himself treading the same ground as his predecessor, faced with the same decisions and betrayals, making similar mistakes. The hard lesson here is not that authoritarians will get theirs. Rather, it’s how much of himself Bolingbroke compromises to become Henry IV due to the grim necessities of political power and contentious regime change. If Bolingbroke is an authoritarian, he has become one in response to the challenges of overthrowing the last one. Even resistance fighters can become tyrants.
The Folger production’s other problems are generally rooted in the same soil as its flawed portrayal of Henry IV — namely, the impulse to update Shakespeare. These included silly costuming choices, irritating applications of the airhorn sound effect, and Michael Jackson-inflected line dances in the buildup to fight sequences, a la the Beat It music video.
In every case, the effects of these “relevant” or added elements were negative, unnecessary dead weight on an otherwise enjoyable production. Edward Gero’s Falstaff, for instance, was sublime, striking a perfect balance between buffoonery, villainy, and pathos.
The reactionary moral here is that there is great merit — and plenty of “relevance” — in simply executing Shakespeare well.

'Journalistic malpractice': Biden campaign slams New York Times

Texto completo: Joe Biden's presidential campaign is taking issue with The New York Times' coverage of work by the candidate's son, Hunter Biden, for a Ukrainian company that's part of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry against President Trump.
At issue is a Wednesday piece by author Peter Schweizer, "What Hunter Biden Did Was Legal — And That's the Problem," which raised questions over the role of Hunter Biden, in Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company from which he once drew at $50,000 monthly salary.
"Are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?" Biden campaign spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield wrote. "We submit that the Times should publicly answer for these failures in reporting on this pressing issue fairly, accurately, and in a way that prioritized truth and judiciousness over sensationalism, as well as why, after the glaring mistakes of 2016, the Times has again given an underhanded hack the validation of its platform."
The Schweizer column argues former Vice President Biden, a leading 2020 Democrat, engaged in "self-dealing" when he pressured the president of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor investigating the company his son worked with.
In a statement to CNN, the New York Times pushed back against the Biden campaign's assertions.
"Our coverage of the Biden campaign and Hunter Biden has been fair and accurate," a representative said and added that the paper "will continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we’re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage."

Texto completo: Once you see it, you never forget it.
Comic Sans, the whimsical, chalkboard-like typeface that often appears in school projects and memes, has been divisive for years. And now, it's in the middle of the Trump impeachment inquiry.
John Dowd, a former attorney for President Donald Trump, wrote that his clients who were asked to appear before House committees were given too little notice to appear. He also said they couldn't meet a Monday deadline for documents and communications because the men were also represented by Rudy Giuliani and the material might be protected by attorney-client privilege.
That letter – Dowd's formal response to the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 3 – was written in Comic Sans.
"Your request for documents and communications is overly broad and unduly burdensome," Dowd typed in Comic Sans. "The subject matter of your requests is well beyond the scope of your inquiry. This, in combination with requiring immediate responses, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Democratic Committee members’ intent is to harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients. "
Here's the letter (yes it's Comic Sans) indicating that Rudy Giuliani's associates will not be appearing or providing documents this week. Attorney John Dowd (Trump's former lawyer) argues the timeframe is too short and info could be attorney-client privileged. pic. twitter. com/3ytCecrPHv
— Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) October 7, 2019
Dowd says clients won't meed demands: Two Rudy Giuliani associates who once dined with Trump and Trump Jr. enter fray of impeachment inquiry
Dowd's clients, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, are two Ukrainian-born business partners, who showered Republican campaign committees with nearly $500,000 and dined with Trump at the White House. They also helped Giuliani meet a key Ukrainian prosecutor as the president's personal lawyer sought to discredit Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Parnas and Fruman were arrested Wednesday on campaign finances charges, federal authorities said Thursday.
Still, social media couldn't stop talking about the font choice, some even joking Dowd should be disbarred.
Is this written in Comic Sans??? https://t. co/x7h6FHVIF5

It's a little-known fact that a lawyer who emails the scan of a signed printout of a legal letter originally typed out in Comic Sans is automatically disbarred pursuant to Judiciary Law § 90(2) https://t. co/Rwakta4Gk3

The Constitution is in Comic Sans now.
— Dan Telfer (@dantelfer) October 8, 2019
Hating on Comic Sans is nothing new.
The font's creator, Vincent Connare, told The New York Times, "If you love Comic Sans, you don't know much about typography. And if you hate Comic Sans, you need a new hobby. "
Connare told the newspaper he thinks Dowd was aware he was using the font and the effect it would have.
In an email to The Washington Post, written in Comic Sans, Dowd expressed disbelief.
"I am laughing," Dowd wrote to the newspaper. "Folks don't have enough to do. I love the font. It is easy on the eye. In 30 years of use, NO ONE has ever questioned it even in the most serious matters. "

Texto completo: Last year, Bryan Fonseca founded a new theater company that produced five shows for its first season. This year, the Fonseca Theatre Company has announced a second season that will coincide with its soon-to-open new building.
The site of the six-show season will be at 2508 W. Michigan St., and it will build on the foundation laid by its first season. That means the fare will center on stage works written, directed and acted by people of color and that help west-side artists develop.
Here's the 0.
'The Brothers Paranormal' Oct. 18-Nov. 10
With a nationwide rise in sightings of ghosts that look Asian, two Thai American brothers start a ghost-hunting business that takes them to an African American couple's home. Prince Gomolvilas writes a play that threads laughter through grief, loss, healing and some scares.
'A Very Bryan Chrystmas 13: How the Grinch Culturally Appropriated Christmas' Nov. 29-Dec. 22
Producing director Bryan Fonseca has put together many variety shows with holiday music, and collected in this one is work from Eric Pfeffinger, Daniel Guyton, Kenyon Brown, Mark Harvey Levine, musical director Tim Brickley and choreographer Mariel Greenlee.
'Salt Pepper Ketchup' Jan. 10-26
In this play by Josh Wilder, the politics of neighborhood redevelopment come alive when a hipster food co-op opens near the longstanding Superstar Chinese Take-Out in the gentrifying Point Breeze neighborhood in Philadelphia.
'The Cake' March 6-22
A girl Della helped raise returns home to North Carolina to get married to a woman. Della struggles with whether to make a cake for a same-sex wedding in this timely play by Bekah Brunstetter.
'Fairview' May 8-24
This play, by Jackie Sibblies Drury, won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Drama. Beverly is having a panic attack and can't rely on anyone to help her with Grandma's birthday dinner. The radio isn't working, her sister is drinking, her brother might not come and her daughter is acting like the teenager she is.
The surprise is in the way it impacts the audience. The New York Times calls it "one of the most exquisitely and systematically arranged ambushes of an unsuspecting audience in years."
'Fade' July 10-26
Mexican-born writer Lucia gets a TV writing job in California where the only other Latino is a janitor. As Abel tells her his stories, she begins incorporating them into her scripts, which prompts her to wonder if she's changed. Tanya Saracho is the playwright.

Texto completo: For far too long, online forums and marketplaces have been granted near-total immunity when they contribute to gun violence.
We have reached a point in America at which mass shootings happen so often that the country sometimes only has a few days -- sometimes only a few hours -- to catch its breath in between. When the shooter is white and male, as mass shooters so often are, the narrative of the "lone wolf" quickly becomes dominant. Anti-gun control ideologues, from the National Rifle Association to Republican lawmakers, assure us that the shooter was a monstrous singularity, just one bad guy who happened to have a gun.
But it takes a village to unleash a mass shooting. It is never solely the result of one person's evil intentions. Many mass shootings could never have taken place without the fuel of racist and misogynist propaganda, or the help of unscrupulous purveyors of the weapons of war, or the failure of public venues to implement effective security measures.
The last factor was highlighted in the Oct. 3 announcement that MGM International would be paying roughly $ 800 million to settle lawsuits filed by victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. MGM International owns the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where bullets were fired from the 32nd floor onto thousands attending a country music festival in October 2017. When it was over, 58 people were dead and hundreds were injured, in the deadliest mass shooting in United States history. Victims alleged that lax security at the hotel, where the shooter was able to bring more than 20 suitcases full of firearms and ammunition to his room over several days, made MGM partly responsible for the killings.
The MGM settlement illustrates the principle of collective responsibility, under which third parties can be considered responsible for harmful acts they did not cause but did not do enough to prevent. Collective responsibility, or secondary liability, is a common theme in the law. Bartenders who serve alcohol to obviously inebriated patrons can be sued if those patrons cause car accidents; grocery stores can be held accountable for failing to clean up spills that lead to injuries; employers can be liable for failing to respond to reports of sexual harassment. Such entities are often said to have breached a "duty of care," and imposing liability is intended to give them incentive to be more careful in the future.
As MGM learned, the denial of collective responsibility can spark outrage. In July 2018, before it entered settlement negotiations with the Mandalay Bay victims, MGM tried to argue that it should be immune from liability. To advance this claim, the company took the unusual step of suing more than a thousand victims of the shooting -- seeking not money, but a ruling that the victims could not hold the company liable. The company's basis for the suit was an obscure law passed in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, the Support Antiterrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act. Under that law, certified manufacturers of security products and providers of security services are granted immunity from liability if they fail to prevent an act of terrorism. Arguing that the shooting was an act of terrorism, and pointing out that MGM had hired a company certified by the Department of Homeland Security to provide security for the concert, MGM claimed that the SAFETY Act shielded the company from liability.
The public response was swift and negative. A few months later, after a federal court rejected MGM's attempt to have the cases consolidated in one court, MGM dropped its attempt to escape liability and entered mediation with the victims.
The outrage over MGM's attempt to evade responsibility for failing to keep its premises safe, and its subsequent decision to accept such responsibility, should be an object lesson to those who run online businesses. For far too long, online intermediaries have sought, and been granted, near-total immunity for harmful uses of their products, services or platforms. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act has been interpreted to provide sweeping immunity to websites and social media platforms for violent propaganda and the facilitation of illegal arms sales.
The Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter used Facebook Live to broadcast the massacre in real time and Twitter to advertise his racist manifestoes; the El Paso shooter posted his anti-immigrant screed on the message board 8chan, a site infamous for promoting virulent misogyny and white supremacy. But when the owner of 8chan, James Watkins, was called before the congressional Committee on Homeland Security in September to answer questions about violent posts, he replied: "My company has no intention of deleting constitutionally protected hate speech. I feel the remedy for this type of speech is counter speech, and I'm certain that this is the view of the American justice system."
Mr. Watkins's feeling has proved correct in case after case attempting to hold websites and social media platforms responsible for defamatory, threatening and illegal content. Courts have very broadly interpreted Section 230's prohibition on treating online intermediaries as "publishers or speakers" of content provided by their users. And the immunity for internet platforms hasn't been limited to the forums where extremists congregate, proselytize and organize real-world violence. It has also been extended to websites that sell weapons.
The online firearms marketplace Armslist, which describes itself as the "largest free gun classifieds on the web," facilitates illegal gun sales by allowing users who cannot pass a background check to find unlicensed sellers. One such user was Radcliffe Haughton, whose estranged wife, Zina, had obtained a restraining order against him. In Wisconsin, where the Haughtons resided, the restraining order prohibited Radcliffe from legally purchasing a firearm. So he turned to Armslist, where he quickly found a seller that didn't require a background check. Armed with the gun he had purchased, Radcliffe entered the salon where Zina worked on Oct. 21, 2012, killing her and two of her co-workers in front of Zina's daughter, Yasmeen Daniel. In April 2019, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Armslist was immune from liability based on Section 230.
The case is now pending review by the United States Supreme Court. It is a tremendous opportunity for the court to address the deadly dual reality created by an overzealous application of Section 230. The MGM settlement acknowledges that in physical spaces, individuals or businesses that fail to "take care" that their products, services or premises are not used to commit wrongdoing can be held accountable for that failure. It is no less important that this duty to take care be honored in virtual spaces.
Mass shootings bring to mind a popular expression often attributed to the 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." While Burke never actually said these words, he did express a similar sentiment that is perhaps even more apt for our time: "When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle."

Texto completo: Beirut • Turkey launched airstrikes and fired artillery across its border into northeastern Syria on Wednesday to open a military operation aimed at flushing out a U.S.-backed militia, Turkish and Syrian officials said.
The Turkish attack came amid a flurry of confusing policy statements from the White House, which on Sunday acquiesced to the operation, agreeing to move U.S. forces out of the way, but on Wednesday, hours after it began, condemned it.
“The United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,” President Donald Trump said in a statement Wednesday.
Turkish fighter jets streaked through the sky over Syrian towns, while explosions from artillery shells boomed, causing traffic jams of terrified civilians fleeing south in trucks piled high with their possessions and children. At least two civilians were killed and others were wounded, a militia spokesman and local journalists said.
Turkey’s long-planned move to root out U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria has accelerated rapidly since Trump gave the operation a green light in a call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey on Sunday.
The operation could open a dangerous new front in Syria’s 8-year-old war, pitting two U.S. allies against each other and raising the specter of sectarian bloodletting. Even before it began, it had set off fierce debates in Washington, with members of Congress accusing Trump of betraying the militia that fought beside the United States to defeat the Islamic State group.
“Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., usually a staunch Trump ally, wrote on Twitter. “This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.”
Trump insisted Tuesday that “in no way have we abandoned the Kurds,” and Wednesday said he firmly opposed the operation.
“Turkey,” he added, “has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place — and we will hold them to this commitment.”
The United States withdrew from 50 to 100 troops from the border area in advance of the operation, and U.S. military officials said that the U.S. was not providing assistance to either side.
Erdogan said the operation aimed to “prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border” but provided no other information about whether Turkish ground troops had entered Syria or how far they would go.
The operation’s scope was vast, with strikes hitting in or near at least five towns along a stretch of more than 150 miles of the Syrian-Turkish border.
The most intensive strikes were near Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, the two towns that U.S. forces withdrew from Monday. But they also targeted Kobani and Qamishli, where one strike left a building in flames and a dead body on the sidewalk, according to a video shot by a local journalist.
“There is a huge panic among people of the region,” a militia spokesman, Mustafa Bali, wrote on Twitter.
“There is a state of fear and terror among the people here, and the women and children are leaving the town,” said Akrem Saleh, a local journalist reached by phone in Ras al Ain. Many of the men were staying at home because they feared that Syrian rebels backed by the Turks would loot them if they found them empty.
Saleh and Bali said that two civilians had been killed in a nearby village by a Turkish strike.
The bombings sound of bombardment shook the town of Akcakale, Turkey, just yards across the border from Tel Abyad. Schools were closed, and children played in the streets, waving flags and cheering a convoy of armored personnel carriers heading to the border.
Loudspeakers blared Ottoman martial music interspersed with stern announcements urging people not to gather in large groups and to stay away from houses facing the border.
“All day they were announcing,” said Fehima Kirboga, 46, as she sat with a relative on the sidewalk in the cool of the evening. “We are very anxious, but where can we go?”
Erdogan had been threatening to send troops into northeastern Syria to uproot the militia, which the United States has partnered with for years to fight the Islamic State group. Turkey considers the militia a terrorist organization linked to a Kurdish guerrilla movement.
In an op-ed in The Washington Post, a government spokesman, Fahrettin Altun, wrote that Turkish forces, with their Syrian rebel allies, “will cross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly.”
“Turkey has no ambition in northeastern Syria except to neutralize a long-standing threat against Turkish citizens and to liberate the local population from the yoke of armed thugs,” he wrote.
The Syrian Democratic Forces, which is made up of the U.S.-allied Kurdish troops, said the area was “on the edge of possible humanitarian catastrophe” because of the Turkish incursion.
“This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded,” the group said in a statement.
The Kurdish-led administration that governs the area issued a call for “general mobilization” to fight the Turks.
“We call upon our people, of all ethnic groups, to move toward areas close to the border with Turkey to carry out acts of resistance during this sensitive historical time,” it said.
The U.S. military, which had been working with the SDF to fight remnants of the Islamic State in Syria, has cut off all support to the militia, two U.S. military officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential military assessments.
One official said that U.S. warplanes and surveillance aircraft remained in the area to defend the remaining U.S. ground forces in northeast Syria but said they would not contest any Turkish warplanes attacking Kurdish positions.
Trump reiterated his opposition to U.S. military presence in the Middle East, writing on Twitter that “USA should never have been in Middle East.”
He said that Turkey should take control of captured Islamic State fighters from Europe whose countries had refused to take them back and who are were imprisoned in northeast Syria.
“Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape or form,” he said in his statement, using an alternative name for the Islamic State.
Tens of thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families are in prisons and camps overseen by the SDF, whose leaders say there have been no discussions with the United States about handing over the facilities.
Turkey made efforts to win diplomatic support for its operation, informing the United States, Russia, Britain, NATO and the secretary-general of the United Nations, the Turkish Defense Ministry said.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged Turkey, a NATO member, “to act with restraint” and to ensure that “the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardized.”
Amélie de Montchalin, the French junior minister for European affairs, said that France, Germany and Britain were drafting a joint statement that would be “extremely clear about the fact that we very strongly, very firmly condemn” the Turkish offensive.
A number of countries, including Russia and Iran, both allies of President Bashar Assad of Syria, called for talks to calm the situation instead of military action.
The U.N. Security Council was to discuss the issue Thursday after requests by European members. Stoltenberg said he planned to meet with Erdogan on Friday.
A military coalition led by the United States partnered with a Kurdish militia beginning in 2015 to fight Islamic State extremists who had seized a territory the size of Britain that spanned the Syrian-Iraqi border.
That militia grew into the Syrian Democratic Forces and eventually took control of the areas liberated from the Islamic State, pushing it from its last foothold in Syria earlier this year.
But the partnership angered Turkey, which considers the militia a part of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, a Kurdish guerrilla movement that has been fighting the Turkish state for decades.
In recent days, Turkey has been preparing an incursion, with forces bused to the border and howitzers positioned behind dirt embankments, pointed at Syrian territory.
After a phone call with Erdogan on Sunday, the White House announced that Turkey would be sending forces into Syria and said the United States would move U.S. troops out of their way.
On Monday, U.S. soldiers withdrew from observation posts near the Syrian border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, in the area where Turkey is expected to enter.
The commander of the SDF, Mazlum Kobani, told The New York Times on Tuesday that his forces would resist any attempt by Turkey to establish a foothold in Syria.
Kobani and a range of current and former U.S. officials have warned that a new fight with Turkey could pull his forces out of areas where the Islamic State remains a threat, opening a void that could benefit President Bashar Assad of Syria and his Russian and Iranian backers, or the jihadis. U.S. officials said Tuesday that the militia was already beginning to leave some of their counterterrorism missions against the Islamic State.
Trump has repeatedly sought to withdraw the roughly 1,000 U.S. troops posted in northeastern Syria as part of his long-standing promise to extricate the United States from what he deems “endless wars.”
But he has faced fierce pushback from others in Washington, including from Republican lawmakers.
On Tuesday, Trump sought to clarify his position, writing on Twitter that the United States had “in no way abandoned the Kurds,” but that it also had good trade relations with Turkey.
He warned that “any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy,” but did not explain what sort of action would cross the line.
Graham warned Turkey on Tuesday not to proceed with the operation.
“To the Turkish Government: You do NOT have a green light to enter into northern Syria,” he wrote. “There is massive bipartisan opposition in Congress, which you should see as a red line you should not cross.”

Lessons 'Papa Joe' should have taught

Texto completo: Please help me get the importance of this infamous Trump-Zelenskiy phone call.
The Democrats and their soulmates in the liberal media are seriously getting ready to impeach the president — again — because President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelenskiy for a couple of favors?
Apparently, given the hysteria, it's the first time in U.S. history that our president has asked the leader of a foreign country to do a favor for him that might help him politically at home.
President Trump asked — "pressed" is the loaded word the New York Times and its multimedia echo chamber uses — Zelenskiy to do two things having to do with political corruption. One was for Zelenskiy to help Attorney General Bill Barr open an investigation into a Ukrainian company involved in Russia's interference in the 2016 election. The other favor, the one that was immediately declared an impeachable offense by the AOC/Schiff/Waters Democrats and liberal TV pundits, involved the shady activities of the Biden Family Overseas Enrichment Corp.
Trump asked President Zelenskiy to have his prosecutor open a corruption investigation into the Ukrainian gas company that put Joe Biden's son Hunter on its corporate board and paid him about $50,000 a month to do what? Hunter knew nothing about the international natural gas business or Ukraine.
That stroke of good luck for the younger Biden in 2015 just happened to occur at the very same time VP Papa Joe was serving as the Obama Administration's bag-man-in-chief for U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine.
Even luckier, when the gas company was about to be looked into for corruption by the Ukrainian prosecutor, Papa Joe came to Hunter's rescue. As he boasted in a video that the New York Times apparently has not yet seen, Papa Joe told the Ukraine government he'd withhold $6 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired in six hours, which he was.
The New York Times and its fellow liberal fake journalists aren't very curious about the details of the Biden family's blatant conflicts of interest. Impeaching Trump is all that matters to them and the Democrats.
The president's phone call won't hurt him politically and he'll never be impeached by the Senate, but the publicity about the Bidens' slippery doings in Ukraine will destroy the Biden Family.
Papa Joe is an old coot who was never going to win the nomination anyway. It's Hunter I feel sorry for. He's young. Now everyone in the media is talking about his personal issues and his past drug problems.
Hunter should have known better to take that high-paying Ukrainian "job."He knew he was being used by the Ukrainian gas company to get access to his dad.
As the son of a famous politician, I know what Hunter has had to deal with. I was offered stuff many times in the 1980s. I'd always call the White House lawyer and ask him what he thought. He'd always say, "Your gut will always tell whether it's wrong or OK. But if you have a problem, call me."
I still get called to go out on Republican campaign trails. They want me to endorse them so they can pretend they have the mantle of Ronald Reagan.
This year I was asked to endorse a politician running for president in, of all places, Ukraine. I wouldn't do it. Then, I was offered $100,000 by someone in the United States just to go to Kiev, go to a cocktail party or two and be photographed next to the candidate.
I turned that down, too.
Someone should have been warning Hunter long before 2015 to watch out for those $50,000-a-month do-nothing job offers.
His Papa Joe, for instance.
Michael Reagan is the son of President Ronald Reagan, a political consultant, and president of The Reagan Legacy Foundation.

Texto completo: The martini is a bit like the Beatles or Abraham Lincoln or Jesus: it's such a well-trod and thoroughly covered subject that you can't help but wonder whether there's actually anything new to say about it. That's a notion that Robert Simonson, author and cocktail writer for The New York Times, faced when writing “The Martini Cocktail" (Ten Speed Press), which was published last month. The book chronicles the history and “bewildering depths" of the drink, the luminaries who loved them, and the evolution of its sister cocktails. It does not, however, cover the bastardization of the drink, which is to say the many years when a Martini, in the public imagination, meant anything served in a martini glass. That desecration of its sophistication aside, it is interesting to note that in the late 19th century, the martini actually emerged as a sweet drink, a concoction of Old Tom Gin, a sweeter version of the spirit, and sweet vermouth.
Simonson is no stranger to the enchantment of simplicity. His last book, “3-Ingredient Cocktails," is a catalog with commentary of some of the most straightforward and nonetheless lovely drinks. Now he delves into well-trampled inquiry of the martini's inventor, the reason for its name, and other aspects of its origin story. In keeping with the gin-soaked sleuths before him, he turns up no conclusive evidence. But that's not to say there isn't something new to learn. One of my favorite tidbits is the theory that the martini is a Republican drink, as its popularity surges whenever there's a Republican in the White House. (See: Eisenhower in the 1950s, Reagan in the greed-is-good '80s, and today.) That's not to imply that this is a book of politics. In fact, it's a good one to reach for when you want to think about anything but.
Early Dry Martini
Perhaps the earliest printed Martini recipe (1904). Makes 1 drink.

1 ½ ounces dry gin
1 ½ ounces dry vermouth
3 dashes orange or Angostura bitters
Olive, cherry or lemon twist
1. Combine liquid over ice in a mixing glass over ice. Stir until chilled, about 30 seconds.
2. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
3. Drop an olive into the glass or express a lemon twist on the surface of the drink and drop it into the glass.

Texto completo: The whistle-blower wrote a memo describing an official who heard the call as "visibly shaken" by it.
WASHINGTON -- A White House official who listened to President Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader described it as "crazy," "frightening" and "completely lacking in substance related to national security," according to a memo written by the whistle-blower at the center of the Ukraine scandal, a C.I.A. officer who spoke to the White House official.
The official was "visibly shaken by what had transpired," the C.I.A. officer wrote in his memo, one day after Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a July 25 phone call to open investigations that would benefit him politically.
A palpable sense of concern had already taken hold among at least some in the White House that the call had veered well outside the bounds of traditional diplomacy, the officer wrote.
"The official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official's view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020," the C.I.A. officer wrote.
The document provides a rare glimpse into at least one of the communications with a White House official that helped prompt the whistle-blower's formal complaint to the intelligence community inspector general detailing a broad pressure campaign on Ukraine by Mr. Trump, administration officials and his personal lawyer.
The complaint and a reconstructed transcript released by the White House formed the basis of the House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
The inspector general, Michael Atkinson, handed the two-page memo over to Congress last week along with other documents that shed light on the whistle-blower and his actions. A person familiar with their contents, which Fox News first reported, described them to The New York Times. A lawyer for the whistle-blower did not comment.
The whistle-blower, who relied on "multiple U.S. government officials" for his complaint, said that Mr. Trump was "using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election."
It was not clear whether the White House official he spoke to on July 26 was the second whistle-blower, who has also provided information to Mr. Atkinson, or a different person. Neither whistle-blower's name is public.
Little, if any, of the whistle-blower's complaint has been disproved, though Mr. Trump has sought to discredit him. The White House transcript largely affirmed his account of the call, and Mr. Atkinson deemed his complaint credible, saying he interviewed others who corroborated it.
The White House official "seemed keen to inform a trusted colleague within the national security apparatus about the call," the C.I.A. officer wrote in his July 26 memo.
Much of the whistle-blower's memo also comports with the existing public record of the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. The C.I.A. officer noted that he spoke to the White House official for only a few minutes, "and as a result, I only received highlights."
The memo detailed key aspects of the conversation, including Mr. Trump's request for investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. Mr. Atkinson shared the memo and the other documents with the House Intelligence Committee last week before a session in which he privately described the steps he took to assess the credibility of the complaint.
In submitting his complaint, the whistle-blower identified three facts that could be used to accuse him of potential bias against Mr. Trump, the documents showed. Two were redacted. The third indicated that the whistle-blower is a registered Democrat, a fact first reported by CNN last week that has widely circulated since.
Responding to that reporting on Twitter, Mark S. Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, brushed off the idea that party registration proved anything about his client's credibility.
"We won't comment on identifying info but if true, give me a break! Bias? Seriously?" he wrote.
Still, the whistle-blower's political affiliation and the other facts, should they become public, could fuel arguments from Mr. Trump and his Republican allies that his actions were politically motivated or that his political views colored how he assessed a string of actions he heard about from other government officials and then summarized in his complaint.
Mr. Atkinson's initial review of the complaint identified some indications "of an arguable political bias on the part of the complainant in favor of a rival political candidate," he wrote in a letter to the acting director of national intelligence in August. But, he added, "such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible."'
As part of his complaint, the whistle-blower filled out a form, also reviewed by The Times, that asked what other actions, if any, he took in regard to his allegations. The whistle-blower checked a box indicating that he had relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump to another "office of department/agency involved," likely a reference to the C.I.A.'s general counsel, Courtney Simmons Elwood. The whistle-blower had an intermediary share his allegations with Ms. Elwood before he approached Mr. Atkinson.
The whistle-blower did not check a box indicating that he had spoken to Congress or one of its committees about his allegations. Republicans have seized on that since Fox News revealed it last week, arguing that it is at odds with the C.I.A. officer's approach to a House Intelligence Committee aide about his concerns before he filed his whistle-blower complaint.
It is illegal to intentionally lie on a disclosure form, but whether the whistle-blower was justified in omitting his initial contact with Congress probably depends on the substance of the interactions.
The officer approached an aide to Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, with vague outlines of his concern, a spokesman for Mr. Schiff has said. The House aide, in accordance with committee practice, encouraged the officer to hire a lawyer to advise him and contact the inspector general. But he also shared some of what the officer conveyed with Mr. Schiff, though not his identity.
The whistle-blower did not indicate on the complaint form that he had spoken to Congress because he did not disclose the substance of his allegations to the Intelligence Committee, a person familiar with the matter said.

Texto completo: Robyn owns pop music. Can we say that? We’re going to say it.
For music fans, Robyn’s name is synonymous with two things: feeling everything and dancing anywhere. The Swedish singer is somehow both a massive musical force and a cult figure. She takes over one of Austin City Limits Music Festival’s headliner slots from Weekend One artist Cardi B on Sunday. It’s been a hot minute since she stopped by ACL Live in 2011 and 2012.
Robyn was a teen pop-R&B singer in the 1990s — remember seeing her on Nickelodeon’s “All That”? After charting a couple singles stateside, her next two albums didn’t made it to the U.S., partially because of song lyrics about her abortion. Feeling creatively stifled by her label, she founded Konichiwa Records in the mid-2000s.
In 2010, she dropped two EPs, later released together as the album “Body Talk,” that made her the stuff of playlist legend. The songs on “Body Talk” — sleek, weird, futuristic hooks — are critical darlings and fan favorites; it’s hard to describe a lot of dance-pop music that came in their wake as anything but “like Robyn.” Would highbrow music outlets cover newer pop stars like Carly Rae Jepsen or Troye Sivan as seriously without “Body Talk”?
Robyn kept a low profile for several years after, suffering personal losses in the meantime. She came back in a big way with last year’s rapturously received “Honey” album.
Not up to speed on Robyn’s music? Listen to these 11 essential tracks of heartbreak, longing, defiance and incredibly catchy choruses. You’ll be one of the first people dancing (or crying, or both) in Zilker Park come Sunday.
“Show Me Love” (from 1995’s “Robyn Is Here”)
If Robyn songs were the siblings from HBO’s “Succession,” this one would be Connor Roy. From her debut album, it’s the oldest on this list and very unlike its siblings. This juicy slice of mid-’90s R&B/pop is typical of the singer’s teen-idol output; peep credit for pop mastermind Max Martin. “Show Me Love” put Robyn in the Billboard top 10 in the U.S., and it still goes great on a birthday party playlist. (It should not be confused with 1993’s “Show Me Love” by Robin S., a coincidence that someone honestly should have stopped from happening.)
“Be Mine!” (from 2005’s “Robyn”)
Quite simply the saddest song Robyn has ever recorded, which is saying something. And in true Robyn fashion, it is the catchiest thing this side of influenza. Contains the most relentless strings this side of a 2005 high school orchestra practice room and the most heartbreaking spoken-word interlude ever committed to modern recording: “I saw you at the station/You had your arm around what’s-her-name/She had on that scarf I gave you/And you got down to tie her laces/You looked happy, and that’s great/I just miss you, that’s all.”
“With Every Heartbeat” (from 2005’s “Robyn”)
Either there’s no chorus or it’s all chorus. I can’t think of many pop songs that better capture the trippy delirium of pain, the way it feels like a friend is driving you home when you’re drunk. You stare out the window trying not to throw up; the streetlights race by but they all look the same. “With Every Heartbeat” evokes the same sensation.
“Dancing On My Own” (from 2010’s “Body Talk”)
Robyn’s big Swedish meatball. If you know a single Robyn song, this is the one that you know. “Dancing On My Own” glitters and sulks in equal measure, gliding along with outer-space twinkles and Death Star menace in lock-step. It’s the ultimate happy-sad song, with pitiful, voyeuristic lyrics about seeing the person you love making out with someone else: “I’m in the corner, watching you kiss her,” Robyn wails. “I’m right over here, why can’t you see me? I’m giving it my all, but I’m not the girl you’re taking home.” The grand irony of “Dancing On My Own” — and all of Robyn’s music — is that it reminds you that you might
be lonely, as NPR’s Sam Sanders wrote this year, but you’re not alone.
“Call Your Girlfriend” (from 2010’s “Body Talk”)
The slightly smaller Swedish meatball. The only song that rivals “Dancing On My Own” in its power to fill a dancefloor in a gay bar at the speed of light. The themes are dang similar; on “Call Your Girlfriend,” Robyn imagines a conversation with the man she wishes she could have, were it not for that pesky girlfriend. Under penalty of death, you are required to watch former “Saturday Night Live” cast member Taran Killam’s viral recreation of the dance from this song’s single-shot music video.
“Hang With Me” (from 2010’s “Body Talk”)
Robyn’s known for pining, but she’s just as good at playing defense, like on this track. This is the ultimate hard-to-get anthem, with the singer pretending like she’s not on the precipice of falling “recklessly, headlessly in love” with the dude she guesses can hang with her, if he does her right.
“Don’t (Expletive) Tell Me What To Do” (from 2010’s “Body Talk”)
One simply does not become a beloved pop goddess without having a middle finger with a healthy upward trajectory. This joint is a trance track with repetitive lyrics about the various things that are “killing” our heroine: her drinking, her smoking, her landlord, her PMS, your nagging. One of the finest examples of Robyn as an alt-discotheque queen who can dominate the room at any video bar at midnight.
“Do It Again” ( from 2014’s “Do It Again” with Röyksopp)
Listen, the mid-2010s were a tough time to be a Robyn fan. She got us all excited with the “Body Talk” era, and then we had to subsist on occasional drops of new material, like her 2014 collaborative EP with Norwegian electronic duo Röyksopp. The song “Monument” best heralds the coming “Honey” era, but I’ve always thought it’s ponderous. The title track is the best of the bunch, a sweeping jolt of cybernetic rave fuel.
“Honey” (from 2018’s “Honey”)
Not to throw around the word “masterpiece” all willy-nilly, but this song is Robyn’s masterpiece. (The New York Times agrees.) After keeping a low profile for 8 years, she returned with a sexy, vibey new manifesto. There was no way to make a new “Body Talk”; minus a couple earworms, “Honey” found Robyn staring back at recent personal losses with her chin up and her eyes a little bleary. The title track is warmth incarnate set to a quiet tick-tock beat, Robyn alternating between spare chants and pure, golden ecstasy. “Look down in the deep, baby,” she urges. “The current is stronger.”
“Missing U” (from 2018’s “Honey”)
One of the aforementioned earworms. This was the first single off “Honey,” and it bridges the gap between the two Robyns: the one you listen to as you try to keep from sloshing a double vodka soda at 2 a.m. and the one you listen to when you’re sad about an ex and walking to Walgreens at 2 a.m.
“Between the Lines” (from 2018’s “Honey”)
Opener “Missing U” is the pop bop, the title track is the climactic opus and closer “Ever Again” is the cigarette in bed. But in-between those peaks on “Honey” are six tracks heavy on atmosphere and low on karaoke potential. “Between the Lines” is the best of the bunch, a house-pop track that you can imagine a millennial Parker Posey shimmying to in a warehouse party somewhere cooler than where you currently are.
Bonus tracks: “Do You Know (What It Takes),” “Cobrastyle,” “Handle Me,” “Indestructible,” “Stars-4-Ever,” “Fembot,” “Monument,” “Ever Again”

Kentucky man builds border wall replica

Texto completo: After President Donald Trump claimed skilled rock climbers could not scale a portion of his border wall for the U.S.-Mexico border, a Kentucky climber has taken that as a challenge.
Rick Weber, a retired engineer in Wolfe County, built a wood replica of an 18-foot high portion of the border wall that includes 6-by-6 columns and a 60-inch-high plate atop. He is now planning a competition to see if members of the rock climbing community can scale his replica wall.
When visiting a portion of the border wall construction in California last month, Trump boasted that "this wall can't be climbed."
"We had 20 mountain climbers. That's all they do -- they love to climb mountains," Trump said in September. "They can have it. Me, I don't want to climb mountains. But they're very good, and some of them were champions. And we gave them different prototypes of walls, and this was the one that was hardest to climb."
Weber wrote on RockAndIce.com that no one in his climbing community knows any of these mountaineers and questions their existence.
"More importantly, to declare something to be impossible to climb to a bonafide rock climber is to issue a challenge," Weber wrote.
Since hearing Trump's claim about the wall, Weber erected his own border wall that consists of four columns spaced 12 inches apart. It's the same height as portions of the wall already in place at the border. Weber owns Muir Valley, which is a rock climbing park in the Red River Gorge.
Several high-ranking mountaineers disputed to The Daily Beast Trump's claims that climbers have tested portions of his wall.
"We live in strange times," Marc Norman, CEO of USA Climbing, the sport's national governing body, told The Daily Beast. "I am not aware of any of our athletes being contracted to do such work. Ironically, I have heard rumors of climbers being contracted by zoos to test animal enclosures, but that is about all."
Other climbers said it was "preposterous" or that it would be hard to find professional climbers willing to help Trump.
But these climbers will get a chance to climb Weber's wall in a competition to take place Friday and Saturday near the Muir Valley parking lot in Wolfe County. Trophies for the free contest will be awarded to the fastest times as well as the cleverest technique and best costume, Weber wrote.
The event coincides with Rocktoberfest, a popular event held at Red River Gorge for professional climbers.
As it turns out, Weber's wall is not unscalable. Weber wrote on Facebook Sunday that one man needed just 37 seconds to scale it by using just a belay rope.
Weber's competition follows recent news regarding the border wall, in which Trump privately mentioned fortifying a moat around the wall stocked with alligators or snakes, the New York Times reported.

Texto completo: 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has said he intends to "change the nature" of his campaign after suffering a heart attack last Tuesday.
Sanders told reporters in Burlington, Vermont, that he would need to change his schedule and slow down in the wake of his health crisis, according to the New York Times. "We were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,” Sanders said regarding his intended schedule adjustments. “I don’t think I’m going to do that."
Sanders, 78, arrived home Saturday, the same day his daughter-in-law Rainè Riggs died after being diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer two days earlier. "I think we’re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,” Sanders said of his plan to scale back. “Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do."
Sanders, the oldest candidate in the wide range of Democratic contenders, acknowledged that his heart attack would weigh heavily on the minds of voters, but he hoped they would look at the overall nature of his campaign. "Everything that happens every day weighs on how people feel about you,” he said. “And my own view is that — and I think it’s the voters’ view — you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate."
Sanders was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week for three days after experiencing chest pains following a campaign event. The doctors discovered he had suffered a myocardial infarction when the senator underwent surgery to receive two stents.
Sanders has rejected the notion that he would drop out of the race, telling his campaign staff he felt "more strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign."

Paul Krugman: Events break through the wall of centrist denial

Texto completo: It’s hard to believe that barely three weeks have passed since Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a mysterious subpoena to the acting director of national intelligence, demanding that he produce a whistleblower complaint filed by someone in the intelligence community.
Since that subpoena was issued, the impeachment of Donald Trump has gone from implausibility to near certainty; I at least find it hard to see how the House can fail to impeach given what we already know about Trump’s actions. Conviction in the Senate remains a long shot, but not as long as it once seemed.
And the whole tenor of our national conversation has changed. It looks to me as if we’re witnessing the rapid collapse of a powerful faction in U.S. public life, one whose refusal to accept facts at odds with its prejudices has long been a major source of political dysfunction.
But I’m not talking about the right-wing extremists who dominate the Republican Party. Sorry, but they’re not going anywhere. Most of Trump’s base is sticking with him, while the list of prominent Republican politicians willing to call out Trump’s malfeasance in clear language consists so far of Mitt Romney and, well, Mitt Romney.
No, I’m talking about fanatical centrists, who aren’t a large slice of the electorate, but have played an outsize role in elite opinion and media coverage. These are people who may have been willing to concede that Trump was a bad guy, but otherwise maintained, in the teeth of the evidence, that our two major parties were basically equivalent: Each party had its extremists, but each also had its moderates, and everything would be fine if these moderates could work together.
Who am I talking about? Well, among other people, Joe Biden, who has repeatedly insisted that Trump is an aberration, not representative of the Republican Party as a whole. (Biden’s refusal to admit what he was facing may be one reason his response to the Ukraine smear has seemed so wobbly.)
Some of us have been pushing back against that worldview for many years, arguing that today’s Republican Party is a radical force increasingly opposed to democracy. Way back in 2003 I wrote that modern conservatism is “a movement whose leaders do not accept the legitimacy of our current political system.” In 2012, Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein declared that the central problem of U.S. politics was a GOP that was not just extreme but “dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.”
For a long time, however, making that case — pointing out that Republicans were sounding ever more authoritarian and violating more and more democratic norms — got you dismissed as shrill if not deranged. Even Trump’s rise, and the obvious parallels between Trumpism and the authoritarian movements that have gutted democracy in places like Hungary and Poland, barely dented centrist complacency. Remember, just a few months ago most of the news media treated Attorney General William Barr’s highly misleading summary of the Mueller report as credible.
But my sense, although it’s impossible to quantify, is that the events of the past several weeks have finally broken through the wall of centrist denial.
At this point, things that previously were merely obvious have become undeniable. Yes, Trump has invited foreign powers to intervene in U.S. politics on his behalf; he’s even done it on camera. Yes, he has claimed that his domestic political opponents are committing treason by exercising their constitutional rights of oversight, and he is clearly itching to use the justice system to criminalize criticism.
Politicians who believed in American values would denounce this behavior, even if it came from their own leader. Republicans have been silent at best, and many are expressing approval. So it’s now crystal clear that the GOP is not a normal political party; it is an American equivalent of Hungary’s Fidesz or Poland’s Law and Justice, an authoritarian regime in waiting.
And I think — I hope — that those who have spent years denying this reality are finally coming around.
It’s important to understand that the GOP hasn’t suddenly changed, that Trump hasn’t somehow managed to corrupt a party that was basically OK until he came along. Anyone startled by Republican embrace of wild conspiracy theories about the deep state must have slept through the Clinton years, and wasn’t paying attention when most of the GOP decided that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by a vast global scientific cabal.
And anyone shocked by Republican acceptance of the idea that it’s fine to seek domestic political aid from foreign regimes has forgotten (like all too many people) that the Bush administration took us to war on false pretenses — not the same sin, but an equally serious betrayal of American political norms.
No, Trump isn’t an aberration. He’s unusually blatant and gaudily corrupt, but at a basic level he’s the culmination of where his party has been going for decades. And U.S. political life won’t begin to recover until centrists face up to that uncomfortable reality.

Texto completo: El gobierno del presidente Donald Trump ordenó a Gordon Sondland , embajador de los Estados Unidos en la Unión Europea, rendir testimonio ante la Cámara este martes, como testigo clave en la investigación para un posible juicio político contra el mandatario.
La decisión de bloquear a Sondland de hablar con los investigadores de tres comités de la Cámara podría desatar un conflicto con los representantes, ya que los demócratas han advertido que si la administración intenta interferir con su investigación, se interpretará como una obstrucción, un cargo que consideran potencialmente digno de juicio político.
El diplomático debía presentarse ante los comités de Inteligencia, Asuntos Exteriores y Supervisión de la Cámara.
Robert Luskin , abogado de Sondland, dijo en un comunicado que, como empleado del Departamento de Estado, su cliente no tuvo más remedio que cumplir con la orden de la Casa Blanca.
“El embajador Sondland está profundamente decepcionado de que no podrá testificar hoy” , dijo Luskin. “El embajador Sondland cree firmemente que actuó en todo momento en el mejor interés de los Estados Unidos, y está listo para responder a las preguntas del comité de manera completa y veraz”.
Apenas se supo sobre la inasistencia del diplomático, el presidente Trump publicó un par de tuits donde asegura que le hubiera gustado que el Embajador acudiera ante los comités, pero acusó falta de certeza jurídica.
“Me encantaría enviar al Embajador Sondland… a testificar, pero desafortunadamente estaría testificando ante un tribunal de canguros (sic) totalmente prejucioso, donde se han quitado los derechos de los republicanos, y los hechos verdaderos no están permitidos para el público” , escribió el mandatario.
Luego el presidente Trump citó un supuesto tuit de Sondland donde lo defiende.
“Es importante destacar que el tuit del embajador Sondland, que pocos informan, donde declaró: ‘Creo que usted están en un error acerca de las intenciones del presidente Trump. El Presidente ha sido muy claro: no hay quid pro quo de ningún tipo’. ¡Eso lo dice TODO!” , expresó el mandatario.
….to see. Importantly, Ambassador Sondland’s tweet, which few report, stated, “I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.” That says it ALL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019
La Cámara citó al Departamento de Defensa y a la Oficina de Administración y Presupuesto para obtener documentos sobre la decisión de la administración Trump de retener $391 millones de dólares en ayuda de seguridad para Ucrania, reportó The New York Times.
Por otro lado, el secretario de Estado, Mike Pompeo, no cumplió con la fecha límite del viernes pasado para producir documentos, incluso cuando el Departamento de Estado continúa las conversaciones con la Cámara.

Lakers’ trip to China suddenly includes navigation through thorny political issues

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

Texto completo: Tuesday’s forecast for Shanghai is not terribly different from Los Angeles weather: sunny, low-70s, little chance of rain.
But even as the Lakers boarded a flight Monday morning bound for China, they knew they were about to fly into a storm.
Sunday’s news cycle was bombarded by reaction to a Friday tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey: “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” The NBA is generally a league that is permissive about expressing personal views on social issues; the estimated hundreds of millions of NBA fans in China are apparently not. Subsequent fallout included Chinese businesses vowing to cut ties with the Rockets, former Houston star Yao Ming saying the Chinese Basketball Association would no longer work with them, and awkwardly worded statements from Rockets ownership and the NBA at large.
In the middle of the madness, the Lakers are flying to Shanghai and Shenzhen, two of the largest cities in the world for a pair of exhibition games with the Brooklyn Nets and a host of league events. What was initially planned as an innocent bit of diplomacy for a league that is extremely popular overseas could now have significantly higher stakes for both the Lakers and the NBA.
Outside of North America, it’s reasonable to say that China is by far the most important market for the NBA. The country of 1.4 billion people is basketball-crazed. According to numbers shared by the league: The CBA estimates that 300 million people play basketball at some level in the country. The NBA has had a dedicated office in China since 2008. Tencent, the league’s top media partner in China, estimates that nearly half a billion people watched NBA programming on their platforms – a figure that has tripled from the viewership just five years ago. It’s common to see Chinese-language reporters roaming locker rooms before and after games, and ESPN has a partnership with Tencent to get one-on-one postgame interviews with players as they walk off the court.
Many players understand the power of the Chinese market, and it’s common for players to tour Chinese cities for their shoe companies. LeBron James, for example, goes abroad virtually every summer.
“I’ve been able to go over there and I’ve always been welcomed with open arms,” he said last week. “They love the game of basketball. It started with Yao and Yi (Jianlian) and those guys over there. We want to make the game as popular as we can and show our appreciation by going overseas in China like we’re doing next week.”
While Chinese fans have a raucous following for both superstars and a handful of major franchises – of which the Lakers are definitely one – they showcase love for players at all levels. Lance Stephenson, who played for the Lakers last year before deciding to play in China this season, recently shared a video on Instagram of the doorman at his hotel mimicking his famous “air guitar” gesture.
Joe Young, who spent Summer League playing for the Lakers, played for Nanjing’s CBA team last season. When he first flew in, he remembers being greeted by hundreds – perhaps even a thousand – fans all bearing roses for him, a foreign player who went on to average 36 points per game for a franchise that hung around the bottom of the league standings. Toward the end of the season, Young didn’t like leaving his apartment for fear that he would be accosted in public by adoring fans.
“It’s just another level over there,” he said. “Those fans are crazy.”
But in light of the Morey incident, it seems that devotion has an uglier side to it: a hair-trigger for rebuking political discourse that puts China in an unfavorable light.
Morey’s tweet touched on a nerve that has been sensitive for months. Hong Kong is in the midst of protests of mainland China’s attempts to assert more control over the island that was a longtime British territory. A bill that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China sparked more than a million people to take to the streets in June to show their displeasure. Since, protesters and the Chinese government have had countless skirmishes, in which the New York Times estimated that some 2,000 canisters of tear canisters had been fired. Complicating the issue, many mainlanders feel that the legacy of Hong Kong is irrevocably tied to the country’s adversarial history with colonialism – Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai tried to relate the context in a Facebook post on Sunday night.
Morey’s tweet was deleted shortly after it was issued, but it was out in the open for the world to notice. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta quickly noted that Morey’s tweet didn’t represent the Rockets, insisting that the team is an apolitical organization. Morey himself issued a statement saying he did not mean to offend Chinese fans. The NBA followed up with a statement that both related that the league supports individuals “educating themselves and sharing their views,” but also called the incident “regrettable.” James Harden, the Rockets’ franchise star, apologized and added “We love China.”
Outside of the league, the clamor was even louder as several political leaders criticized the NBA for kowtowing to Chinese interests – Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri even wrote an open letter to the NBA asking them to cancel the Lakers’ exhibitions there.
On other hot-button issues, the NBA has stood unconditionally behind its players’ ability to express political views. On his own, James has spoken in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, for gun legislation and against NCAA amateurism. Other politically outspoken NBA figures include coaches Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr, who have been particularly critical of the White House. Political expression has now entered the fabric of the NBA, so it’s all the more evident when the league tiptoes around a statement such as Morey’s that threatens its standing in a lucrative market.
The conflict of economic interests and political motivations is a needle the league has managed to thread for more than a decade of its increased investment in the Chinese market. This moment is arguably the first serious threat to the harmony that the NBA and China have managed to maintain. The Lakers, who sport two enormously popular stars in James and Anthony Davis, have a chance to heal some of the damage done.
Still, the larger question is likely to linger: Was it reasonable in the first place for the NBA to expect to have it both ways? That might not be so easily resolved.

DEMOCRATIC RIVALS QUESTION WARREN’S COMMITMENT TO ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’: Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s Democratic rivals are putting pressure on her campaign to explain the extent of her support for “Medicare for All” and to detail whether she would accept any alternatives as president.
Warren, a Massachusetts senator, declared on the debate stage in June that she was “with Bernie on Medicare for All,” referring to Bernie Sanders, the longtime champion of "Medicare for All," which would enroll everyone living in the U.S. into a government plan and abolish nearly all private health insurance.
Over the years, however, she has waffled on the issue and in Congress she has signed onto other, less-sweeping plans, raising the possibility that she might be more willing than Sanders to endorse a less comprehensive overhaul of the healthcare system.
It’s not clear yet whether Warren would back off from “Medicare for All” if she were to become the Democratic nominee. It’s a potentially crucial issue between the 2020 Democratic rivals, who are staking claims to the far-left flank of the Democratic electorate.
Though a majority of polls show Joe Biden leading the Democratic primary race, combined support from Warren and Sanders outweighs Biden's. And Medicare for All offers both candidates opportunities to differentiate themselves on a key policy issue from Biden, who favors expanding the Affordable Care Act, which is based on private insurance markets.
“It doesn’t seem like much daylight between what [Warren] is saying and what Sanders is saying in terms of supporting ‘Medicare for All’ as the policy prescription for what they think we ultimately need,” said Wendell Potter, president of Business for Medicare for All.
But Warren’s support for setting up a single, government healthcare system hasn’t always been unwavering.
As recently as this year, she re-introduced a bill that would bring more health insurers into Obamacare and co-sponsored legislation that would allow states to let their residents buy into Medicaid, a government program that covers the poor.
She appeared to support a fully government financed healthcare system in her 2008 book Get Sick, Go Broke. But then when she was running for Senate in 2012 she said in a media interview that she didn’t support it, noting she hadn’t authored the book alone. Instead, she said it was important to move in the direction of getting more people covered and lowering the cost of healthcare. Throughout that campaign she stressed the need to protect Obamacare.
And while Warren has said she favors abolishing private health insurance, she also has chosen her words carefully during debates. In September, she suggested Medicare for All was the “best way” that “everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost.” She didn’t declare it as the only way to help get to universal coverage, nor did she bash other ideas from rivals such as Biden that would preserve private health insurance but also allow more people the option to buy into a government plan.

BUTTIGIEG OUT WITH ‘AFFORDABLE MEDICINE FOR ALL’: Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigeig came out with a plan Monday to let the government negotiate drug prices for people who are on Medicare and those who join a government plan under his healthcare proposal “Medicare for all who want it.” Seniors would pay no more than $200 a month for prescription drugs.
HEALTHCARE.GOV SETS MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE: The six-week open enrollment for Obamacare kicks off Nov. 1, and for six Sundays the site will face up to as much as 12 hours of downtime for maintenance. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shares the calendar information so that customers and people who help them get coverage can be prepared, but the site rarely goes down for the full amount of time that has been set aside for maintenance. Last year there was one period where the site was down for 10 hours and another for 12 hours, but the other time slots were only about half that time, and on another day the site didn’t go down at all.
“Maintenance windows are regularly scheduled every Open Enrollment during the lowest-traffic time periods on HealthCare.gov,” said a CMS spokesperson. “This year’s potential planned maintenance schedule is similar to previous years.”
REPUBLICAN SIGNS ONTO DEMOCRATIC PAID LEAVE BILL: The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would pay for parental and sick leave for up to 12 weeks though a payroll tax, just gained GOP Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey as a co-sponsor. The legislation from Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut has long had the backing of Democrats in Congress but Republicans have been unwilling to sign onto a plan that would add more taxes on workers and businesses.
SANDERS GETTING BACK TO WORK MONDAY AFTER NEWLY REVEALED HEART ATTACK: Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders suffered a heart attack last week, his doctors said Friday. Sanders rested at home over the weekend and then released a plan Monday morning to keep corporate PAC money out of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Sanders’ latest plan would prevent big financial donors from funding most of the Democratic National Convention, which he said happened in 2016.
GIMME VAPOR: VAPING ADVOCATES GEAR UP TO FIGHT TRUMP OVER FLAVOR BAN: Advocates for the rights to vape and sell flavored vaping products are poised to fight President Trump’s proposed flavor ban, which has yet to be finalized by the Food and Drug Administration. State and national consumer advocacy groups, like the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, are coaching members to contact their legislators, file grievances with state and federal legislation that undermines the right to vape, and organize public demonstrations close to home. Advocates are going so far as to say this ban, if implemented, could trip Trump up in the 2020 election. Julie Woessner, director of national policy at CASAA, said: “People who voted for Trump felt he supported the free market, small businesses, consumer choice. And now he’s going to preside over the most massive dismantling of an industry pretty much ever. And it’s pretty much betrayal.”
THE ‘INDIVIDUAL MANDATE’ IS BACK ⁠— FOR IMMIGRANTS: The White House announced Friday that all adult immigrants seeking a visa to live in the country legally must prove they can obtain health insurance to do so within 30 days of arrival. Immigrants would need to prove they can pay out-of-pocket for care or get coverage through an employer, directly from an insurer, through a short-term plan that offers less comprehensive coverage, or through a relative.
The White House said the proclamation was necessary because immigrants, even when they have arrived legally, are more likely to be uninsured than citizens and therefore seek medical care at hospital emergency departments where the government pays for uncompensated care. The new policy will go into effect Nov. 3.

Texto completo: Most business tools can be used either well or badly.
Email can speed interoffice communications, or it can overwhelm with too much information. Spreadsheets can make calculations easier or they can be riddled with hard-to-find errors. Word processing can create attractive, easy-to-read documents or, well, Comic Sans.
When used well, such tools make an organization smarter, more creative, and able to make better decisions. When used poorly, they do the opposite. The classic misuse of email, SPAM, for example, creates visual and mental noise.
Most productivity tools have these two sides. But PowerPoint is different. When used poorly, PowerPoint makes an organization dumb. When used well, PowerPoint makes that organization even dumber. Let me explain.
(Note: by "PowerPoint" I mean the Microsoft product and its clones.)
Every description of PowerPoint best practices suggests using PowerPoint to make your presentation more vivid, alive and entertaining. A common way to do this is to animate your graphs, so that the bars grow into their final position, right before your audience's eyes. Cool, eh?
Well, it turns out that animated graphs lead to bad decision-making. Robert Cialdini, professor emeritus of psychology and marketing at Arizona State University, and author of the classic business bestseller "Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion" (www.influenceatwork.com), showed three groups of people performance statistics for a fictional high-school football player named Andrew. He then asked each group to rate Andrew, as a player, from one to seven.
The first group received a hard-copy table of statistics, the second group got a hard-copy of a bar graph, and the third group were shown a PowerPoint presentation with animated graphs. The first two groups rated Andrew a 4.5 and five respectively. The group that saw the animated graphs rated the Andrew a six.
Cialdini repeated the experiment using sports fans who were more experienced at understanding such statistics. The first two groups came up with the same number. The group shown the animated graphs rated Andrew as high as the novices had done, as a six.
In other words, this "best practices" PowerPoint technique fooled even experts into giving a higher rating. As the New Yorker summarized, "PowerPoint seems to be a way for organizations to turn expensive, expert decision-makers into novice decision-makers."
A similar study of PowerPoint usage at the University of Houston that was published in "Computers & Education" found that "students performed worse on quizzes when PowerPoint presentations included non-text items such as pictures and sound effects."
Another study at Purdue University, also published in "Computers & Education" found that "students retained 15% less information delivered verbally by the lecturer during PowerPoint presentations."
Yet another study, this one from Harvard, showed that having words on a screen while you're talking has no effect, positive or negative, on comprehension or retention, rendering your efforts to create the presentation completely wasted.
Are you seeing the pattern here? PowerPoint isn't helping, regardless of how it's used. So what gives?
The root problem with PowerPoint is the way it encourages you to think, says Edward Tufte, an expert on information design. According to a New York Times article summarizing Tufte:
"Microsoft's ubiquitous software forces people to mutilate data beyond comprehension. For example, the low resolution of a PowerPoint slide means that it usually contains only about 40 words, or barely eight seconds of reading. PowerPoint also encourages users to rely on bulleted lists, a 'faux analytical' technique... that dodges the speaker's responsibility to tie his information together."
Or as Tufte himself put it: "PowerPoint induces stupidity, turns everyone into bores, wastes time, and downgrades the quality and credibility of communication."
In other words, PowerPoint makes your organization dumber.
That's why, incidentally, PowerPoint is so excellent as a sales tool (as opposed to a productivity tool.) PowerPoint dumbs the customer down, making them more likely to make a buying decision based on bells and whistles rather than actual information.

The alternative
If you want your organization to get smarter rather than dumber, here's what you do:
* Ban PowerPoint from your workplace. That's for all internal meetings but especially when people from outside your organization are trying to sell you something.
* Start every meeting with a group reading. Prepare a short document summarizing the issues, providing some analysis, and defining the decision on the table.
* Writing a briefing document (as opposed to slapping down bullet points) forces people in your organization to think their ideas through, before expending everyone else's time on them. It also makes your meetings shorter and more to-the-point.
That strategy comes, BTW, from Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos. So if you're still clinging to PowerPoint, you might consider that maybe Jeff Bezos knows more than you when it comes to making an organization smarter.

Texto completo: Keckly was born a slave but bought her freedom and began working for the first lady. Her memoir offered a rare look inside the Lincoln White House.
Since 1851, obituaries in The New York Times have been dominated by white men. With Overlooked , we're adding the stories of remarkable people whose deaths went unreported in The Times.
It was the morning of April 15, 1865, and President Abraham Lincoln had just died of an assassin's bullet. Mary Todd Lincoln, his widow, was cloistered in the White House, wailing in grief, unable to reach her closest confidante: her dressmaker.
Elizabeth Keckly was finally ushered into the darkened room.
"Why did you not come to me last night, Elizabeth?" Mary Lincoln said, reproaching her. "I sent for you."
"I did try to come to you, but I could not find you," Keckly answered, laying her hand on the widow's brow.
The moment, as recounted in Keckly's 1868 memoir, "Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House," was indicative of how far she had come.
The path that had led Keckly to become a first lady's most trusted friend was almost unimaginable. She survived rape and years of beatings, going on to start her own business and eventually buying her way out of captivity. Then she earned a place as one of the reigning couturiers of high society in Washington.
One of a relatively small number of literate slaves, Keckly was also among the first African-American women to publish a book. Her memoir is now considered one of the most important narratives of the Lincolns' domestic life.
"She was an historian, and that was really unusual -- for a black woman to write as an historian of a time and a place and a White House," Jennifer Fleischner, author of the 2003 biography "Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Keckly," said in an interview.
Keckly suffered for it: Reviewers lambasted the book -- and her -- when it came out, and it soon disappeared from bookstores.
"She would much better have stuck to her needle," The New York Times wrote that year. "We cannot but look upon many of the disclosures made in this volume as gross violations of confidence."
"Behind the Scenes" was sympathetic to Mary Lincoln yet honest about her flaws. The appendix included -- almost certainly without Keckly's permission -- correspondence from Mrs. Lincoln to Keckly that put the first lady's difficult personality on display.
"Readers in her day, white readers -- they took it as an audacious tell-all," Fleischner said. "You know, 'How dare she'? There were two categories: the faithful Negro servant or the angry Negro servant. Keckly was neither servant, nor faithful, nor angry. She presented herself, the White House and Mary Lincoln as she saw and knew them. And that didn't work."
"Behind the Scenes" is again in print, and Keckly has been cited in books and portrayed in movies and plays about the Lincolns, including Steven Spielberg's 2012 film "Lincoln."
Jennifer Chiaverini's novel "Mrs. Lincoln's Dressmaker" (2013) took Keckly as its subject, and George Saunders quoted from her memoir in his novel "Lincoln in the Bardo" (2017), about the Lincolns and the death of their son Willie.
"I don't think it would exist, if I hadn't read her memoir," Saunders said of his novel in an email. "It was reading her firsthand account that made me feel that an anecdote I'd heard, about Lincoln entering his son's tomb, could support a book. It's the most detailed, moving thing written about the death of Willie and his parents' grief."
Elizabeth Hobbs Keckly (sometimes spelled Keckley), was born in February 1818 in Dinwiddie, Va. She was the daughter not of the black slave whom she believed was her father but -- as her mother, Agnes, disclosed in her last days -- of Armistead Burwell, the white planter who owned their family.
In her teens, Keckly was sent to North Carolina to work for Burwell's son Robert, whom she would one day learn was her white half brother. There, she was sometimes savagely whipped. Of one such occasion, she wrote in her book, "I did not scream; I was too proud to let my tormentor know what I was suffering."
Repeatedly raped by a white store owner, she gave birth to her only child, George, when she was about 23.
Keckly was eventually given to kinder owners and moved with them to St. Louis. To help the family earn money, she started a seamstress business there and was soon in high demand. Her mother had taught her to sew when she was as young as 3, and she had an unusual talent for it.
Shortly after, she received a marriage proposal, but she declined to accept it, writing, "I could not bear the thought of bringing children into slavery -- of adding one single recruit to the millions bound in hopeless servitude."
Keckly raised with her owners the idea of buying her freedom for herself and her son, and after long negotiations they finally accepted $ 1,200 and freed her in 1855. She settled in Washington and continued her work as a seamstress.
One day in 1861, after Lincoln had taken office, a well-connected client wanted a gown made quickly. She promised Keckly that if she could complete the task, she would introduce her to the fashion-conscious new first lady, who was looking for a "modiste," or dressmaker.
Mary Lincoln summoned Keckly for an interview, then asked her to make a "bright rose-colored moiré-antique" dress that she could wear to the Inaugural festivities.
Keckly got the job. (Lincoln himself declared the completed dress "charming.")
In her new position Keckly became a celebrity of sorts; Lincoln addressed her as "Madam Elizabeth."
The first lady could be difficult and moody; Keckly was sometimes the only person who could manage her.
In turn, Mary Lincoln confided in Keckly about her debts and sought counsel on such White House matters as planning state dinners or Lincoln's campaign for a second term.
"Lizabeth, you are my best and kindest friend, and I love you," Mary once wrote to her.
Keckly had a unique inside look into the lives of the Lincolns. After Willie Lincoln died of typhoid at 11, she was helping to prepare his body when the president walked in.
"I never saw a man so bowed down with grief," she wrote.
During the Civil War, Keckly also started the influential Contraband Relief Association, with support from Mary Lincoln and the abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The "contraband" was former slaves who had sought refuge in the nation's capital.
After the publication of her memoir, which angered Mary Lincoln, she and Keckly never spoke again. Still running her business, though with fewer clients, Keckly committed herself to teaching young African-American women her trade. For a time, she headed the domestic sciences department at Wilberforce University, which her son George had attended before dying on a Civil War battlefield.
She spent her last years in Washington, in the National Home for Destitute Colored Women and Children, which her Contraband Relief Association had helped found.
There, "she suffered greatly from headaches and crying spells," John E. Washington wrote in the 1942 book "They Knew Lincoln."
"All day long she looked at Mrs. Lincoln's picture above the dresser, and seldom left her room except for meals," he said.
Elizabeth Keckly died in her sleep in May 1907. She was 89.
"What a life she had," George Saunders said in an email, "to go from slavery to the White House, lose a son in the war, write a book, befriend the Lincolns, fall out of their favor, witness so many essential historical moments. To me, her book is beautiful and I think we are so lucky to have it."

Texto completo: They are not partisans but stewards of our constitutional democracy.
In accusing the intelligence community whistle-blower of partisanship and treason, President Trump has redefined whistle-blowing to serve his private interests rather than the rule of law. In the American tradition, whistle-blowers expose illegal or unconstitutional acts that the powerful want to keep secret.
That the current game-changing official intelligence community whistle-blower complaint has reached the American people is a miracle for which we should be grateful. Americans must focus on the content of the whistle-blower complaint, which the White House has not denied. The president has obvious reasons to spin the complaint, but genuine whistle-blowers are not partisans. They are stewards of our constitutional democracy.
Whistle-blower protection is as old as the Republic itself. Congress passed the world's first whistle-blower protection legislation in 1778 in an effort to keep American elites honest.
The current whistle-blower complaint shines light on an attempted cover-up and an intelligence community that sees the president advancing the Trump brand at the expense of American national security.
But the whistle-blower is just the tip of the iceberg. In Mr. Trump's presidency, there have been unprecedented disclosures from the intelligence community on his behavior. While overturning longstanding intelligence community norms, Mr. Trump has repeatedly charged it with partisanship. But members of the intelligence community swear allegiance to the Constitution, not the president. They serve their country regardless of the party in the White House.
From the start, Mr. Trump trampled on longstanding intelligence community ideals of nonpartisanship and the importance of presenting the unvarnished truth to politicians. As his conversations with both the president of Ukraine and the prime minister of Australia indicate, Mr. Trump sees Bill Barr, the attorney general -- a man charged with dispatching impartial justice in the United States -- as his personal lackey.
The experience with Mr. Barr is hardly an isolated case. For example, Mr. Trump had similar aspirations for James Comey. An F.B.I. director typically serves a 10-year term, spanning multiple presidential administrations. Barack Obama met only twice with Mr. Comey before his confirmation as F.B.I. director, once to interview him for the job and the second time to inform him of his imminent nomination. At their second private meeting, the president told Mr. Comey it would be their last, since impartial justice requires an F.B.I. director to be independent of the president.
In contrast, in the short four months before Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey without informing him first on May 9, 2017, he met with him without others present no fewer than four times.
Because of Mr. Trump's disturbing and unprecedented repeated attempts to secure loyalty to him from members of the executive branch rather than to the truth or to the Constitution, many have leaked -- like Mr. Comey, who leaked some of the contents of his memos chronicling his interactions with the new president.
To be sure, some intelligence community leaks fall into a gray area when viewed in isolation, especially those that expose a departure from norms of national security policymaking. For example, some of the leaked transcripts of Mr. Trump's early calls with foreign leaders, which inspired the lockdown of subsequent controversial conversations, revealed a shocking departure from the behavior of past presidents and a woeful lack of preparation for the leadership of the free world. But they did not rise to the level of whistle-blowing.
National security whistle-blowing is the most difficult kind, since all national security officials must protect classified information. One man's whistle-blowing can therefore be another's insider threat. In the United States today, national security whistle-blowing is possible in theory, but in practice is still a dangerous thing to do. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 provides protection to all government employees except national security employees.
The 1998 Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act and Mr. Obama's executive order PPD-19 attempted to carve out a safe space for whistle-blowing in the intelligence community despite the national security exception, but national security whistle-blowers do not currently have full statutory protection. Had the contractor Edward Snowden lodged a formal complaint with the National Security Agency inspector general, for example, his disclosures would never have reached the American people.
It is hardly unusual for American presidents to punish leakers harshly. Mr. Snowden was the seventh person the Obama administration charged with violating the 1917 Espionage Act.
But Mr. Trump is the first American president, in this context, to encourage foreign electoral interference while actively seeking to intimidate and shut down the work of institutions intended to keep government accountable to the people. He is also the first president to incite his supporters via tweet to retaliate against a whistle-blower whom both his own intelligence community inspector general and Congress deem legitimate.
Like the president, intelligence community employees swear an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. In insisting on speaking truth to power at great personal sacrifice, whistle-blowers serve their country and challenge all of us to think for ourselves. What could be more American than that?

Texto completo: Meharry Medical College this week staunchly defended its decision to accept $7.5 million from an e-cigarette company to study vaping, pointing to a mysterious outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries and deaths as the strongest evidence yet that research was long overdue.
Meharry announced in June — before the outbreak became a national concern — it would launch a new health research center with a landmark study on the impact of vaping. As envisioned, the plan would put Nashville's historically black medical school on the forefront of vaping research.
But controversy built swiftly because Meharry's research would be mostly funded by a grant from Juul, the nation's largest e-cigarette company, a third of which is owned by Altria, a tobacco giant.
Patrick H. Johnson, a Meharry executive who sought funding from Juul, said Wednesday the lung injury outbreak shows criticism of the vaping research is misplaced and "uninformed." If this research had begun a few years ago, Johnson said, both scientists and the general public would now have a clearer understanding of the risks of vaping.
"We are unapologetic about this. It is the right thing to do," Johnson said. "We feel strongly that we should be here representing the communities that we serve, that trust us to serve them."
He added later: "It would be malpractice for us to not to wade into this right now when we can see it coming. We just can't stand on the sidelines and not do anything about it."
E-cigarettes have existed as a smoking alternative for nearly two decades but remain largely unresearched and unregulated. Vaping became vastly more popular in recent years, especially among teenagers and younger adults, and has further expanded as legal marijuana spread to most states. Concerns arose this summer due to a surge of severe lung injuries that are believed to be caused by vaping.
As of Wednesday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention tallied 805 cases of lung injury and 12 deaths. Thirty-six cases have been reported in Tennessee, but no deaths. No single vaping product or ingredient has been identified as the cause of the illnesses, but the CDC says most cases appear to be linked to vaping of THC products, which remain illegal in Tennessee. Some health experts believe the outbreak may be related to vape cartridges that have been sold or modified on the black market.
Concern about the outbreak has seized the nation, prompting President Donald Trump to announce last month he planned to ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarette products. Juul later announced it removed its CEO and would halt most advertising and lobbying efforts related to its e-cigarette products.
But, at Meharry, the Juul-funded work is just beginning.
Johnson said the college is narrowing its search for a "world-class investigator" to lead the Center for the Study of Social Determinants of Health that will conduct the vaping research. Currently, the center is mostly funded with Juul's dollars, Johnson said, but Meharry is pursuing more money that should eventually outsize the grant from Juul.
The vaping outbreak also prompted Meharry to consider expanding its research, Johnson said. Initially, the Juul-funded study was envisioned to focus exclusively on nicotine vaping, but Johnson said the college is interested in researching THC and CBD vaping and the health impacts of counterfeit and black-market vape products.
Meharry, Juul, backlash and trust Juul's research grant drew criticism long before vaping illness worried the nation.
After the initial announcement in June, the New York Times reported vehement backlash from African American health experts and activists. Meharry President James Hildreth responded to criticism with a guest column in The Tennessean, insisting that the college knew "who we are dealing with" and "what we are getting into."
"As the president of Meharry," Hildreth wrote, "I am determined that, this time, we will be engaged on the forefront as our nation grapples with the emerging e-cigarette industry and its implications, including its allure for youth."
A few Meharry students and anti-tobacco activists opposed the Juul grant money during a town hall meeting held on campus in August. By accepting money from Juul, critics said, the college was participating in the tobacco industry's longstanding strategy of marketing specifically to black people.
"It essentially carries on the same playbook for the tobacco industry for the black community," said Phil Gardiner, an official from the University of California's Tobacco Related Disease Research Program. "It's really the people who are doing the main killing of black folk, essentially, buying a lot of evil science."
Johnson defended the grant at the forum, insisting Meharry could still produce independent research on vaping even if it took money from Juul. Historically, black people are among the last to benefit from health research, Johnson said, but this grant would allow Meharry — and by extension, black communities — to lead the way.
"My community is not going to be the last to know if its good or bad," Johnson told a crowd at the forum. "If it is devastating, I want to tell everybody to run from day one."
During his interview with The Tennessean last week, Johnson said the criticism of Meharry's decision was outsized in an academic world where industry-funded research is common.
Johnson said universities that are larger and predominately white often take donations or research funding from tobacco companies and opioid manufacturers, but aren't met with the same distrust.
Johnson, who is black, said he believes at least part of the difference is race.
"I've received more calls for interviews and we've received countless numbers of emails that questioned whether Meharry has the ability to do the same as our counterparts around this country," Johnson said. "The outlier of that is, which institution primarily employs and trains people who look like me?"

Texto completo: Mary Bridget Davies has nailed the art of singing like the legendary Janis Joplin.
"It was literally scientific," Davies says. "I asked myself, 'How does she do that? How?' I spent years on and off playing with it. I had the raw material to re-create the sound, but it took a while to really do it. I blew my voice out figuring out 'How do I crack this code?'"
She eventually cracked it and for the past seven years has starred in "A Night With Janis Joplin," for which she received a Tony nomination. The musical, an imagined concert headlined by Joplin, visits Stifel Theatre Tuesday and Wednesday. It's full of staples such as "Piece of My Heart," "Me and Bobby McGee," "Cry Baby," "Mercedes Benz" and "Summertime."
"What I love the most about the show -- it's like Janis' ultimate concert she could have given if she wanted to," says Davies, 41. "And though it's called 'A Night With Janis Joplin,' it's not just her. You assume it's her all night. It's also Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Odetta and Bessie Smith -- a whole ensemble of women. That's the treat."
She says the show takes the audience along for Joplin's journey to stardom, with the music that helped shape her.
"There's monologues in between, it's fun and it clips along at a good pace," Davies says.
Of the show's 26 songs, 23 involve Davies. Her favorite is "Ball and Chain," a Big Mama Thornton blues song. "The way Janis does it is so different and so great," she says. "Janis Joplin's version is the white psychedelic version of it."
Davies says it was crucial that "A Night With Janis Joplin" also tell the story of and give credit to the women who influenced Joplin. Otherwise, "it would just be an impersonation show, a sad and underdeveloped concept," she says. "This is why we added the women who shaped her. She found it important, since she was a white woman in music getting all the attention, but, 'hello, these are all the people who did it before me.' She would herald these women."
"A Night With Janis Joplin" got its start in 2012 as "One Night With Janis," where it was performed in Washington, D.C., and Cleveland before being retooled for Broadway.
For its 2013 Broadway opening, the title was altered, and the cast was filled out. And additional music and some original music made it feel like a totally different show.
"A Night With Janis Joplin" -- the New York Times praised Davies' performance as a "positively uncanny vocal impersonation" -- played Broadway for 141 performances over eight months. The original plan was for a two-year run. A move to off-Broadway was scrapped at the last minute.
The show has the blessing of Joplin's estate, which Davies says oversees everything from a quality control perspective.
"I know there were different shows about Janis in the past," she says. "But her siblings were like, 'We're telling the story right.'"
Davies has toured with Joplin's band Big Brother and the Holding Company. And before "A Night With Janis Joplin," she starred in a touring production of "Love, Janis" in 2006 as that show was winding down.
Davies discovered Joplin's music as a child in Cleveland. While she was busy trying to listen to Salt-N-Pepa and New Kids on the Block, her parents played music by Joplin and John Lee Hooker.
"When people ask me which Janis Joplin songs I know, I say, 'Which ones do you want to hear?' I've been preparing for this role my entire life."

Maine astronaut Jessica Meir will take part in first all-female spacewalk

Texto completo: Maine astronaut Jessica Meir is scheduled to take part in the first all-female spacewalk later this month.
NASA announced Friday that Meir and Christina Koch will take a spacewalk together on Oct. 21, when they will install lithium-ion batteries that will improve the power supply at the International Space Station.
The announcement comes almost seven months after NASA scrapped its planned all-female spacewalk by Koch and Anne McClain because it did not have two properly fitted space suits, according to The New York Times.
Meir arrived at the International Space Station about 250 miles above the Earth aboard the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft on Sept. 25 with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka and Emirati astronaut Hazz Al Mansouri. Within 36 hours of her arrival, Meir began work on experiments that could prove key to developing new drugs to treat cancer, Alzheimer's and other diseases.
"What we're doing now shows all the work that went in for the decades prior [and] all the women that worked to get us where we are today," Meir told NASA TV when asked about the milestone. "The nice thing for us is we don't even think about it on a daily basis. It's just normal, we're just part of the team, and we're doing this work as an efficient team working together with everybody else. It's really nice to see how far that we've come."
Meir, the valedictorian of Caribou High School's Class of 1995, was among three women and four men selected from 6,100 applicants in 2013 for NASA's 21st class of astronauts. (Koch also is a member of the 21st class of astronauts.) Before that, Meir was rejected for NASA's 20th class of astronauts. NASA announced in April that she would go on her first spaceflight.
Meir is the third Mainer, and first Maine woman, to enter into outer space, the others being Christopher Cassidy, a York High School graduate who has completed six spacewalks and served as the nation's chief astronaut from 2013 to 2017, and Charles O. Hobaugh, a Bar Harbor native who has made three spaceflights.

Texto completo: If you know young people who read, see if you can grab 'em on Tuesday and get to downtown Norfolk. Lamar Giles - a renowned author of children's books and a co-founder of We Need Diverse Books - will be at the Slover Library. He'll be talking about the power of personal stories and the importance of representing everyone in children's literature. Selected Norfolk Public Schools students will read their work, and there'll be kids' activities and refreshments.
Giles' debut YA thriller was "Fake ID," followed by "Endangered" and "Overturned," and then, this year, by "Spin." His middle-grade debut was "The Last Last-Day-of-Summer." The New York Times accorded "Spin" an exceptional review, calling Giles a "terrific plotter" with characters that feel "palpably real."
"But what's even more impressive is the subtle stuff you almost don't notice because Giles wears his intellect so lightly: the masterly knowledge of hip-hop and R&B; the command of technology's uses and abuses; the discerning ear for the way high schoolers talk, both to one another and to grown-ups. Giles understands the complex force field between generations. He knows that when parents and grandparents say they 'expect more' from teenagers, it's often because they haven't bothered to figure out who the teenagers actually are."
Details: 2-3:30 p.m. Free.
235 E. Plume St., Norfolk. Room 650. 757-431-7491.
Reminder: Tayari Jones - author of the bestseller "An American Marriage" - on Thursday will start ODU's President's Lecture Series. Free. 7 p.m., Big Blue Room, Ted Constant Convocation Center. Free parking in Garage D, 1070 W. 45th St., Norfolk.
ODU's annual literary festival starts today with a reception, then four days of author readings. The theme is "crossing thresholds": "What can we learn from each other," the organizers ask, "by examining our lives and stories, moving from the outside and coming in, opening a door, extending a hand?"
Other festival headliners include Elaine Castillo, "America Is Not the Heart"; Ilya Kaminsky, "Deaf Republic"; and José Olivarez, "Citizen Illegal." Also: writer-in-residence Xuan Juliana Wang ("Home Remedies"); Desiree Cooper (flash fiction, "Know the Mother"); Chen Chen ("When I Grow Up I Want to Be a List of Further Possibilities"); and regional writers Elaine Fletcher Chapman, Benjamín Naka-Hasebe Kingsley, Mary Jean Kledzik, Renee Olander, Phil Raisor, Noah Renn and Kent Wascom.
Venues are at ODU in Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Details: ODU.edu/LitFest
Reminder: Rita Mae Brown will be in Newport News at 7 p.m. Thursday. Tickets needed; pick up at certain Peninsula libraries. Details: TheVPLC.org or 757-926-1350. Christopher Newport University, 1 Avenue of the Arts, Newport News. Doors open at 6:30.
Audiobooks are increasingly popular among adults in the U.S.: 20% had listened to one in the 12 months before they were surveyed between Jan. 8 and Feb. 7. (In 2011, 11%.) The Pew Research Center also said 72% of U.S. adults had read a book in those 12 months in any format, and print books won 65% of those readers. About a quarter, 27%, said they hadn't read a book partly or completely in the past year.

From the news:You may recall the case of the former Stanford U. swimming star who, convicted in 2016 of sexual assault, faced up to 14 years but got six months. The woman Brock Turner attacked now has a book, "Know My Name," and has revealed that name, Chanel Miller. You may also remember that her victim impact statement went viral; that California then passed minimum sentencing requirements; and that the judge was recalled. This memoir testifies in part to "the power of words." (Huffpost)

Texto completo: HORROR STORIES
By Liz Phair
Random House, 263 pp. $28
In the song “Stratford-on-Guy" toward the end of Liz Phair's era-defining 1993 album “Exile in Guyville," the speaker is having a flash of transcendence on a plane 30,000 feet over Chicago, the city of her inspiration and her angst. The chorus – “It took an hour, maybe a day / But once I really listened the noise just fell away" – captures her small but critical epiphany about judgment, perspective, and the power of cool distance.
Phair's beautifully written new book, a memoir called “Horror Stories," is a collection of similarly small but critical epiphanies, a number of them, like “Stratford-on-Guy," triggered by planes and hotels and the tsuris and flimflam of being a rock star.
Obviously, “Horror Stories" is a book and not an album, but it plays out like a batch of interrelated Phair songs, each chapter a separate and specific story, all together accumulating into an intimate self-portrait.
Leave it to Phair, who doesn't tend to conform to expectations – of gender, of rock 'n' roll, of sexuality, of truthfulness – to build a narrative on her own terms, as a series of seemingly random vignettes from early childhood (a brush with a spider's nest) to adulthood (a crush on a Trader Joe's guy) that double as painfully honest emotional revelations. There is no chronology, as the chapters jump among her assortment of bookmarked memories, incidents of fear and desire (the horror stories of the title) that led to clarity.
Phair slips in the objective facts of her life — that she and her brother were adopted, that her marriage broke up after she had an affair — only as they relate to the tale at hand, in service of the greater points she's making. She also changes the names of her exes. She's mapping out her psychic grid, not the specific neighborhood of her childhood or the roots of her family or the particulars of her love life.
Also, don't expect a ton of alternative rock dish and tour partying deets, past or present, outside of Phair's own confessions about “being your own product" and the difficult trust involved when you submit to a photo shoot. There is a chapter about Ryan Adams, who is never named, written after he faced #MeToo allegations in the New York Times. Adams had been producing an album for Phair, a response to the Beatles' White Album in the way “Exile" was a response to “Exile on Main St.," but the project fell apart, partly because they weren't compatible in the studio, and partly, Phair conjectures, because she never agreed to sleep with him.
The true gist of the chapter, though, isn't Adams gossip; it's the mindset of the woman who is famous for writing sex-positive songs about refusing to be cowed by men. She recalls being pawed at by older bosses as a teen, being “hunted" by boys in college, learning, as she puts it, “that my body was not my own sovereign territory." “If you think I invited that kind of interest after I published sexually frank lyrics," she writes, “you'd have gotten the cause and effect flipped. ...By the time I recorded 'Exile in Guyville' I had been fending off disturbing and unwanted attention for almost two decades already."
Horror stories often involve monsters, and those predatory men are among the ugliest in the book. There's a boyfriend named Rory who, not long after lobbying her to have a baby with him, explains that an ex whom he still sees sometimes had their baby two months earlier. He “forgot" to tell her. Phair dumps on him just a bit as she mines the experience for survival skills. And there are the nameless, judgy ones who could never understand her loneliness; “You don't get to sing about sex and call men out and still be part of a happy, committed relationship," she describes them thinking.
But one of the lovely things about “Horror Stories" is Phair's inclination to own her own mistakes and naivete. Self-aware lines such as, “The trappings of celebrity amount to a defensive wall behind which I can hide," are a refrain throughout the book, along with her regularly busting of herself for her own vanity. She is focused on her own weaknesses, not those of others, hoping to turn them into strength. She looks back on the dissolution of her marriage after son Nick is born, but, like on her 1998 album “whitechocolatespaceegg," she does so mostly with compassion for herself and her husband.
One of the most powerful chapters, called “Labor of Love," finds Phair preparing to give birth to Nick. It becomes an opportunity for her to reflect on being adopted. “I never know how much importance to give it," she writes. “Is it a minor detail in my biography, or does it define me?"
Using some of the book's typically choice language, she recalls seeing the original copy of her birth certificate: “It was also a snapshot of a fleeting moment of wholeness, before I carried in my heart this broken piece of glass, which I've been careful not to disturb lest it cut me." Childbirth also gives Phair an opportunity to think — both amusingly and poignantly — about her vagina, and the awkwardness of baring it to a room of medical personnel.
You might expect that kind of explicit material from Phair, whose self-titled 2003 album features a song (“H.W.C.") about ejaculate. She's famous for it. But you might not expect the way Phair delivers sex and the rest of her world to us this time out, with equal parts elegance, humor, and authenticity.

Texto completo: I USED to think calling cars "death machines" was kind of extreme. Then my niece was hit by one.
She was only 9 years old, out with her family in Los Angeles and running toward an ice cream truck. She was hit with such force that most of her front teeth were knocked out. She is lucky to be alive.
Thinking about my niece made me recall all the other times members of my family had been injured by a car. My husband's grandmother was killed. My aunt and uncle were seriously injured. I was even involved in a hit-and-run in a crosswalk in front of my school when I was a kid that broke my leg.
Cars are death machines. Pedestrian fatalities in the United States have increased 41 percent since 2008; more than 6,000 pedestrians were killed in 2018 alone.
Here's the thing: Statistics clearly don't seem to persuade anyone of the magnitude of this problem.
If numbers don't change minds, can personal experiences?
I conducted an experiment on Twitter this summer, asking people to share my tweet if a car had hit them or anyone they knew. It was shared thousands of times, and more than 500 people shared their stories. Several are presented on this page.
Many people say autonomous or "smart" cars will fix the death machines. So far, I'm unpersuaded.
Since 2014, over $ 80 billion has been spent on "smart" or connected cars (more on these in a minute) and autonomous vehicles, arguably to make cars safer. But investing in the car of the future is investing in the wrong problem. We need to be thinking about how we can create a world with fewer cars.
Among the safety measures are encouraging pedestrians and bicyclists to use R.F.I.D. tags, which emit signals that cars can detect. This means it's becoming the pedestrian's responsibility to avoid getting hit.
This may be the worst outcome of the automobile-centered 20th century: the assumption that it's people who need to get out of the way of these lethal machines, instead of the other way around.
Many so-called advances in car design may be making things much worse. The internet-equipped "connected car," for example, initially introduced by Cadillac in 1996 as a luxury safety feature known as OnStar, has morphed into something else entirely. Increasingly large and complicated dashboard screens take cognitive resources away from the task at hand and have the potential to be as dangerous as texting while driving.
Just as car manufacturers scramble to make vehicles more technologically complex, they've gone all-in on making them bigger -- much bigger. Americans are buying more S.U.V.s than ever before, a shift that has led to an 81 percent increasein single-vehicle pedestrian fatalities involving S.U.V.s between 2009 and 2016, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
Because the front end of an S.U.V. is higher than the average car's front end, it is far more likely to hit a pedestrian in the chest or head and twice as likely to kill walkers, runners, cyclists and children, compared withregular cars.
I'm not so naïve to think we can get rid of cars altogether, but we have so many tools to eliminate traffic-related injuries and fatalities right now. We can all commit to driving less, which reduces both CO2 emissions and the potential for crashes. And we should absolutely regulate S.U.V. grill heights.
Other solutions run the gamut from the quick and easy fixes -- like reducing speed limits, eliminating right turns on red, building protected bike lanes and instituting congestion pricing -- to major and necessary commitments like funding new transit projects and rethinking land use to encourage walkable development rather than sprawl.
Until we act, the streets will belong to the death machines.

ALEXANDRA WATSON, BOULDER, COLO.: "A driver bolted toward traffic without stopping at the stop sign. He hit me broadside, sending me into traffic that was thankfully empty at the moment. The next thing I remember was being helped onto the grass with my bent-up bike and someone asking me where I lived. I was in fifth grade at the time. That's only one of three stories I have."

I was airlifted to the hospital and had seven broken bones, five surgeries, spent three months in hospital, one year in a wheelchair. The driver went to jail ... Just kidding, of course he only got a ticket. No real consequences."

Two right-hooks, one road-raged me into a row of parked cars. Hit once on San Pablo in Oakland: a thrown-open door that I bent all the way back and flipped over the top. He demanded I pay to repair his car door and threatened to get his gun before he ran."

After his death, I joined with others and helped found Families for Safe Streets in N.Y.C." (PHOTOGRAPH BY DEMETRIUS FREEMAN FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Texto completo: Many brides, not so much grooms, see a presumptive and sexist slant on social media and online marketing, before and after their wedding.
Laurie Vazquez, a 36-year-old marketing manager in New York City, had decided to keep her last name after she got married in June. But not everyone seemed to be on board with these plans.
Before and after the wedding, the Knot, an app she used to plan and share memories with family and friends, and WeddingWire, a site that provided wedding vendors, both repeatedly sent emails reminding her to change her last name.
"They stressed me out," Ms. Vazquez said. "They were so close to the day of, and I had millions of other things to worry about."
She unsubscribed to the emails. Then once Ms. Vazquez designated that she was married on her Facebook profile, she began seeing ads for baby products on the social media platform. "They made an assumption about me," she said. "I know the societal trend for young women in their 20s is to start family planning quickly after they get married, but that's not me."
As technology has evolved, wedding festivities have spilled over onto websites, apps and social media. Most couples now post photos with specific hashtags, request gifts using online registries, and share event details on wedding-planning sites. Yet while these tools may be the future of weddings and wedding planning, many users feel they're stuck in the past when it comes to women.
"The wedding industry's appeal to outdated name-change practices, not to mention notions of 'tying the knot,' confirms how out of touch they are," said Chrys Ingraham, a professor and chair of sociology at SUNY Purchase.
Even hashtag generators seem to have a sexist slant.
"I wanted a hashtag, but it was all like 'husbands' name,"' said Amy Lewanski, a 29-year-old marketing coordinator and writer in San Diego. Typing "John Smith" and "Jane Doe" into ewedding.com's hashtag generator, for instance, yields #DoeToSmith, #BecomingSmith, #SmithJokes4ever, and #YouHadMeAtSmith among the first five results (the other being the more neutral #JaneAndJohnForever).
And then there are Instagram bridal accounts like @greenweddingshoes and @junebugweddings, among hundreds of others, that share photos of extravagant dresses, settings and décor, which some brides feel adds pressure to an already stressful time.
"These bridal accounts are focusing more on what a woman is supposed to look like rather than on the emotion of the day," said Nomi Pratt, a wedding photographer in Greenville, S.C. "Social media has made brides feel as though they should fit into a mold of 'the perfect bride' who is skinny, hair is perfect, makeup is without smudge, and flowers are larger than she is.
"Instead of being fully present in the moment and full of emotion for their spouse, they're worried about getting the perfect Instagram photo."
It's not just social media encouraging brides to stay on top of their appearances. The Knot provides a checklist for women users with items like "figure out your wedding style," "save wedding dress photos," "make a beauty plan," and "meet with hairstylists." Grooms who sign up for the Knot receive checklists as well, but they do not include references to hairstylists or beauty plans.
Lauren Grech, who runs the New York event management firm LLG Events and is an adjunct professor at N.Y.U.'s event management master's program, finds none of this surprising. "Apps were created to cater to the female audience," she said, "because women were traditionally the ones most involved in the wedding planning process and in purchasing items for their first home."
Companies are evolving their products in response to user feedback about those old-fashioned values and gender roles.
Melissa Bach, a senior director of public relations for the Knot Worldwide, which also includes the WeddingWire, said the company recently made some updates to its website, app, social media and emails. This included, she said, changing the phrase "bridal party" to "wedding party" and showcasing photos of same-sex couples. Last year, the Knot also changed the name of its proposal site from "How He Asked" to "How They Asked."
"While we've taken many steps toward being more inclusive, we know that we're not perfect and there's always more we can be doing to be better," Ms. Bach said.
Traditions have been gradually changing. A 2015 New York Times survey found that 20 percent of married women had kept their last names. Ms. Nickel also noted that in the last five years, "grooms in male-female weddings, particularly millennial grooms, are more involved with wedding planning."
At the same time, Ms. Grech said, "companies, publications and apps are making significant strides to be all-inclusive, couple-centric, and an accepting place where all types of couples are welcome." She said the Knot and the registry site Zola have become more L.G.B.T.Q. inclusive. For example, rather than searching registries by "bride's name" and "groom's name," these sites now simply ask you to type a first name and last name. They also allow users to select items that say "Mr. and Mr." or Mrs. and Mrs." instead of just "Mr. and Mrs."
Lindsey Nickel, a business coach for wedding planners, believes people working in the wedding industry can help combat sexism.
"I think it's really important for wedding vendors to not assume anything," said Ms. Nickel, who also runs the Lovely Day Events wedding planning company, which serves Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Napa and Sonoma, Calif.
"For example," she said, "don't assume that the bride is going to take the groom's last name; don't assume that the bride's parents are paying for everything; don't assume that the groom is only going to help with the D.J. planning; don't assume there will be a father-daughter dance or a mother-son dance."
Friends and family can be less stereotypical, too, Ms. Nickel said. Rather than write "she's so beautiful" and "our gorgeous bride" on social media, they can praise other qualities, she said.
"Very rarely do I see social media posts that mention how friendly, smart, good at planning, or kind a bride is," Ms. Nickel said. "It would be so easy for people to include personal characteristics not just about looks."

Texto completo: Writers’ workshops are popping up everywhere.
Some, like Inlandia Institute’s workshops around the Inland Empire, are free, sponsored by Inlandia’s donors and philanthropic organizations. Others are hosted by celebrity authors or internet bloggers, such as Elizabeth Gilbert, Joyce Maynard and Dani Shapiro. A recent New York Times Style section reported on the proliferation of celebrity-run workshops that cost hundreds — even thousands — of dollars and take place in venues as disparate as New York City and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.
Why are these workshops — free or expensive — finding so many takers? It’s quite possible that rubbing elbows with celebrities motivates some who pay up for Maynard’s or Shapiro’s sessions. But it’s certainly not why about 120 people have come to my free or low-cost Inlandia workshops over the past three years.
For them, I believe the motivation comes from a need to tell stories.
In my memoir-writing workshops, I sense an urgency to be heard, read and remembered by their children and grandchildren. Since most of my participants are at least as old as I am (mid-60s), I understand the urgency: There’s no time like the present. In fact, we may have no time other than the present.
But even my fiction-writing participants feel compelled to tell stories. Their ages spread across generations — currently, my workshop at the Palm Springs Public Library comprises 14 writers, ages 25 to 91. I believe my 91 year old will live well past 100, given his health and energy, and my 25 year old is certainly not contemplating an imminent demise. That’s not the source of their urgency.
Some people suggest people hope to make money writing now that real jobs (not gigs) are harder to find. If that were the case, they would be quickly disabused of that fantasy. The average full-time novelist makes somewhere around $6,000 a year — not a living wage.
Authors, essayists and academics have written books about humans as “storytelling animals.” They argue that we teach by telling stories, we make excuses for ourselves by telling stories and we grab the limelight by telling stories. We learn by hearing stories, and we empathize by listening to stories. Stories are the means by which we entertain ourselves, share our humanity, make friends and construct arguments.
So, why this sudden rush to write them down?
I believe the urgency to write isn’t about money or time, it’s about a pent-up supply of stories to tell. My husband and I once lived in a tree-lined neighborhood in Denver, in a house with a fine front porch that comfortably accommodated us and our two dogs plus a couple of neighbors or passersby. Nearly every night when the weather was amenable, we sat out there with a beer or a glass of wine, and talked with friends and complete strangers. I doubt that we were aware of it at the time, but as I look back, I realize this was our story-telling hour. We told stories about our days and about our lives, and we listened to stories. It was an essential part of our day, and when the weather turned bad, our cabin-fever was at least in part a result of the isolation that the snow, ice and cold caused and the hiatus in our story-telling hour.
We no longer have such a front porch, and neither do most Americans. And those who do may sit out on the step for days without anyone wandering by or coming out of the house across the street. Most of us are inside watching “Game of Thrones,” playing video games or Googling. While all of those activities are about story, as well, most of us are passive, not active participants in the telling. We’re not asked to tell a story — we’re just asked to listen. Our extended families are spread across the country — if not the globe — as well. We see them rarely, and most of our communications are via Facebook or Instagram, neither of which lend themselves to in-depth story telling.
In some towns, including Palm Springs where I live, community organizations have initiated storytelling events where people are coached and encouraged to stand up and tell stories to a receptive audience of their peers. But clearly, these programs can’t soak up all of the desire to tell stories, and hence, writers’ workshops proliferate.
Perhaps some of the current popularity of writing workshops has to do with self-publishing — now made easy by the likes of Kindle Direct Publishing, Ingram Spark and Lulu. Anyone can write a story and make a book these days; we don’t have to wait for a big publishing house in New York or London to grant us permission. And Joe Moran, author of the recently published book “First You Write a Sentence,” suggests that computers and printers produce pretty pages, which encourages everyone — regardless of the quality of the sentences — to think they’re a bona fide “writer.”
But, I believe this rush to write stories has more to do with our technology-inspired isolation than technology-inspired hubris. We want to tell each other stories, and we want our stories to be heard.

Otro funcionario de inteligencia considera presentar una queja sobre Trump, según NYT

Texto completo: Un segundo oficial de inteligencia está considerando presentar una queja y testificar ante el Congreso sobre sus preocupaciones sobre los tratos del presidente Trump con Ucrania, informó el New York Times el viernes, citando a dos personas informadas sobre el asunto.
The Times informó que el oficial tiene más información directa sobre la situación que involucra a Trump que el primer denunciante, cuya queja presentada en agosto ayudó a provocar la investigación de juicio político contra Trump que la Cámara demócrata lanzó la semana pasada, reporta The Hill.
Según los informes, el Inspector General de la Comunidad de Inteligencia Michael Atkinson entrevistó a la persona para corroborar las afirmaciones originales del denunciante.
Trump ha criticado repetidamente al primer denunciante no identificado, cuestionando sus motivos y acusando que son “partidistas”.
Mientras tanto, el Director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire, dijo al Congreso a fines de septiembre que creía que el denunciante hizo lo “correcto” al presentar su queja.
El denunciante presentó su queja por preocupaciones sobre la llamada telefónica de Trump al presidente de Ucrania a fines de julio en la que Trump presionó al líder extranjero para que iniciara una investigación sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden , un destacado candidato presidencial demócrata.
Una transcripción aproximada de la llamada emitida por la Casa Blanca dada a conocer la semana pasada, corroboró varios puntos clave en la queja del denunciante relacionada con la conversación de Trump con el líder ucraniano.
El denunciante original no tenía conocimiento directo de la conversación, pero escribió que obtuvo información de “múltiples funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con conocimiento directo”.

Texto completo: Un segundo oficial de inteligencia está considerando presentar una queja y testificar ante el Congreso sobre sus preocupaciones sobre los tratos del presidente Trump con Ucrania, informó el New York Times el viernes, citando a dos personas informadas sobre el asunto.
The Times informó que el oficial tiene más información directa sobre la situación que involucra a Trump que el primer denunciante, cuya queja presentada en agosto ayudó a provocar la investigación de juicio político contra Trump que la Cámara demócrata lanzó la semana pasada, reporta The Hill.
Según los informes, el Inspector General de la Comunidad de Inteligencia Michael Atkinson entrevistó a la persona para corroborar las afirmaciones originales del denunciante.
Trump ha criticado repetidamente al primer denunciante no identificado, cuestionando sus motivos y acusando que son “partidistas”.
Mientras tanto, el Director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire, dijo al Congreso a fines de septiembre que creía que el denunciante hizo lo “correcto” al presentar su queja.
El denunciante presentó su queja por preocupaciones sobre la llamada telefónica de Trump al presidente de Ucrania a fines de julio en la que Trump presionó al líder extranjero para que iniciara una investigación sobre el exvicepresidente Joe Biden , un destacado candidato presidencial demócrata.
Una transcripción aproximada de la llamada emitida por la Casa Blanca dada a conocer la semana pasada, corroboró varios puntos clave en la queja del denunciante relacionada con la conversación de Trump con el líder ucraniano.
El denunciante original no tenía conocimiento directo de la conversación, pero escribió que obtuvo información de “múltiples funcionarios de la Casa Blanca con conocimiento directo”.
El presidente Trump y otros republicanos han atacado la credibilidad de la persona.
Mientras tanto, los demócratas dijeron que el testimonio de Atkinson el viernes ante la Cámara confirmó detalles importantes del llamado de Trump con el presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky .

Gandhi at 150: Site Attacked, and Ashes Gone

Texto completo: MUMBAI -- He is the revered father of Indian independence, and it was what would have been his 150th birthday. And yet, on Wednesday, vandals attacked a memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, painted "traitor" in lurid green across his picture, and may have stolen some of his ashes.
Police officials in Rewa, in central India, site of the memorial, said they thought it was an inside job because there were no signs of a break-in and the thick green paint defacing Gandhi's picture was being used by workmen at the memorial.
Given Gandhi's status as a titan of peaceful resistance, the vandalism might seem unthinkable. But it appeared rooted in the kind of Hindu nationalism that inspired his assassin in 1948, and which has been on the rise in India in recent years.
Chanchal Shekhar, Rewa's inspector general of police, said that detectives were taking writing samples from the memorial workers to see if they matched the scrawl found on Gandhi's picture.
There were widespread reports that a small container of Gandhi's ashes was missing from the memorial, suggesting that vandals had taken it. But Mr. Shekhar said that was still unclear: While an urn of ashes that the memorial received after Gandhi's death is gone, it may have been moved years ago.
This is hardly the first such attack. In June, a Gandhi statue in eastern India was decapitated. Similarly, some right-wing Hindus have built statues to Gandhi's killer, Nathuram Godse, the Hindu fanatic who shot him.
Ramachandra Guha, a Gandhi biographer, said that right-wing Hindus had long hated Gandhi but that under the current government -- led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party -- "they have become more emboldened."
"It's worrying," Mr. Guha said. "Gandhi is our greatest export. Gandhi is to India what Shakespeare is to England."
Gandhi was a lawyer from an upper-caste family who mobilized millions of Indians in peaceful protests in the 1930s and 1940s, pressuring British colonizers to leave. That set the ball rolling for large parts of Africa and Asia to also seek independence.
His methods -- boycotts, mass strikes and seizing the moral high ground -- inspired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and many other champions of social change.
But India's far-right wing is still furious at Gandhi for urging equality between Hindus, who make up about 80 percent of Indian society, and Muslims, about 14 percent. Gandhi accepted the creation of Pakistan, a Muslim-majority state that was carved out of British India.
In a New York Times Op-Ed article published on Wednesday, Mr. Modi commemorated Gandhi's birthday and praised his unswerving bravery, peaceful tactics and devotion to the poor. "In Gandhi, we have the best teacher to guide us," Mr. Modi wrote.
But what was missing was any mention of the religious harmony that Gandhi espoused.
Many Indian intellectuals believe India is more dangerously polarized between Hindus and Muslims than it has ever been and have been urging Mr. Modi to condemn hate crimes against Muslims. Mr. Modi is unusually quiet; so far he has said nothing about the attack on the memorial.
"Modi's relationship to Gandhi is curious and interesting," Mr. Guha said.
When Mr. Modi was chief minister of Gujarat, Gandhi's home state, he did not talk much about Gandhi or make a big deal of his birthday, Mr. Guha said.
But since he became prime minister five years ago, Mr. Modi has channeled Gandhi to appeal to moderate Hindus and people outside India. He adopted the image of Gandhi's famous circular glasses as the symbol of his Clean India campaign, and has taken foreign leaders, like Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, to pay respects at memorials.
After Gandhi died, some of his ashes were sprinkled in the Ganges River and dozens of small batches were given to memorials around India.
Ram Kirti Sharma, an activist with the Indian National Congress, the leading opposition party, of which Gandhi was a member, said he was shocked when he visited the memorial in Rewa on Wednesday and heard that ashes were missing and saw that the picture had been defaced.
"I just couldn't believe my eyes," he said. "This can only happen in today's India. It is sad; I feel disgusted, angry, but also frightened."
Gandhi died long ago, he added, but now "people want to kill his ideas."

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren raised nearly as much money as Bernie Sanders over the past three months. They have both shunned wealthy donors, yet they are way ahead of everyone else.
LOS ANGELES -- With Senator Elizabeth Warren's announcement on Friday that she raised $ 24.6 million in the past three months, the fund-raising picture for the leading Democratic presidential contenders has come into focus: Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are in strong position to fund their campaigns over the long haul.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, whose campaign announced raising $ 25.3 million in the third quarter, both brought in more money than they had in the previous quarter, while money totals were down for two of their top competitors, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
Ms. Warren's total also offers further evidence of her steady rise to the top of the pack in the Democratic primary race, where she now rivals Mr. Biden as a leading contender for the nomination. And while Mr. Sanders trails both of them in recent polls, he has a loyal following that has supported him with millions of small donations this year, ensuring that he is well positioned for a primary season that could stretch through next spring.
More broadly, the fund-raising totals show the collective enthusiasm in the party for progressive candidates pushing messages of sweeping change. And they demonstrate the undeniable power of online donors in the primary. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off courting wealthy donors and holding elite fund-raising events, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg -- who raised $ 15.2 million and $ 19.1 million in the quarter, according to their campaigns -- both pursue money from big donors.
The fund-raising hauls by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren show that there is "strength and power to their ideas that they're putting forward, and people are engaged," said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign.
"I think for anybody else in the race, you have to pay attention to that -- that there is energy around some of these big ideas that represent bigger changes," she said.
Mr. Biden's total did little to bolster his status in the race. Already under siege from President Trump and no longer enjoying a clear lead over the rest of the field in national polls, Mr. Biden saw his fund-raising drop roughly 30 percent from the previous quarter.
Mr. Sanders exceeded Mr. Biden's total by about $ 10 million and Ms. Warren exceeded it by more than $ 9 million -- an indicator of the gulf between Mr. Biden and his two progressive rivals in attracting grass-roots support.
And for the second consecutive quarter, Mr. Biden, a two-term vice president who previously served in the Senate for 36 years, was bested by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of the fourth most populous city in the 17th most populous state.
Ms. Warren's campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $ 26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $ 25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign.
"Please take a moment to be proud of the movement you're helping build," Roger Lau, Ms. Warren's campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. "Close your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast," he suggested.
Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $ 2,800 checks to candidates -- the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race.
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders "are breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties," said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. "This is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics."
Beating Mr. Sanders's total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren's campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders's status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable.
In the long run, Mr. Sanders's slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015.
"The biggest takeaway is that Warren is on a roll," said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. "She's got wind at her back. It's evident in her polls, her fund-raising and the energy at her events."
Among other candidates who have disclosed their fund-raising for the third quarter, Senator Kamala Harris raised $ 11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised more than $ 10 million and Senator Cory Booker raised more than $ 6 million, according to their campaigns.
Presidential candidates must report their fund-raising for the quarter, which covered July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.
Ms. Warren struggled with fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign, but those struggles ended up being short-lived. Her third-quarter haul is another validation of her strategy to rely on online donors to finance her campaign.
That choice is central to her bid for the presidency, freeing up her schedule and creating a tidy contrast with some of her rivals: While other candidates gather with rich donors, Ms. Warren spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in the "selfie line" at her town-hall-style events.
"I made the decision early on I was not going to spend my time behind closed doors with corporate executives and bazillionaires," Ms. Warren told the crowd at a town hall in Carson City, Nev., on Wednesday night. "I was going to spend my time here."
At a town hall in San Diego on Thursday night, she reached her latest selfie-related milestone: She has now taken pictures with an estimated 70,000 people since beginning her campaign. She made it to the end of the selfie line just before midnight.

Texto completo: Readers react to an article about a football team that can't compete with richer suburban schools.
To the Editor:
Re "Poor Schools Can't Compete With Suburban Rivals. Should They?" (front page, Sept. 23):
I can appreciate the dejection felt by the members of the Hoover High School football team in Des Moines as they lose to better-endowed schools from their district. Fifty years ago, I played high school football at my lower-middle-class school in Los Angeles. We were mediocre at best, competing with wealthier schools whose facilities were better and whose players weren't concerned about the daily anxieties of family economics. The disappointment is certainly real.
At the same time, it is hard for me to muster much passion to take on inequality in sports when high school students in some schools don't have enough to eat, when the academic facilities in schools are woefully inadequate, when security in neighborhoods is precarious, when many of the families of students still lack health insurance. Let's solve those problems, and then concern ourselves with athletic inequities.

To the Editor:
What a depressing article. If this were a Hollywood movie, the poor but scrappy football players from Hoover High would overcome the superior equipment and technology of the richer suburban schools and triumph through sheer innate talent, an inspiring coach and a greater desire to win.
Alas, the real world of 2019 is much crueler than that. This football story is just one more signifier of the devastating and wide-ranging effects of poverty and gaping inequality. We should be ashamed.
Janice Gewirtz

To the Editor:
It's time the education of our children was paid for by the federal government. Continuing to have local school districts pay for our children so unequally is a crime. Every school should have well-funded athletics, art, music, social workers, counselors and a nurturing staff.
It's time we treated all of our wonderful students as the true infrastructure of this country and invested in them well. The federal government could proudly raise the bar for all of its schools and reduce failing schools in America to an oxymoron.

Texto completo: It’s not enough that Democrats are starting an impeachment process over a ridiculous, convoluted accusation for reasons that are almost impossible to follow. Now their friends in the national media are trying to scare everyone into thinking President Trump will react by going on a shooting spree.
Liberal New York Times columnist Charles Blow ominously warned this week that “before Trump will allow himself to be chased from the temple, he’ll bring it down.”
On that same day, Thomas Edsall, previously the sole remaining voice of sanity on the Times’ op-ed page, used an entire column to publish the wild speculations of a bunch of supposedly smart people who apparently believe that Trump is set to overthrow the government in a military coup.
“We should not assume that either a 2020 election defeat or impeachment/conviction will remove Trump from the White House,” said Notre Dame professor emeritus David Leege. “As president, Trump has resisted any effort to curb citizen access to guns and ammo. He puts on a modest show of concern when a particularly bad gun massacre occurs but, in the end, he sees armed citizens as a significant personal asset.”
That was just the beginning of Leege’s psychic visions. He went on to question whether the armed forces would rally behind Trump in the event that he refused to exit the White House. “Coups are usually backstopped by colonels, not generals,” said Leege, perhaps in a dark room with only a flashlight used to illuminate his face. “Thus, major barracks could provide him with support. Probably his best strategy to keep all levels of the military loyal to him rather than to the Constitution would be to embroil us in a major war.”
In his own words, Edsall wrote that Trump appears “willing to burn the house down.” The evidence for that is apparently Trump having defended himself from what is nothing more than a naked power grab by House Democrats, describing it as “a COUP.”
The impeachment Hail Mary is of course not really a coup because Republicans should be able to stop the nonsense once it reaches the Senate — though you can always count on the Mitt Romneys and Jeff Flakes of the party to turn something easy into a difficult problem. But this whole thing is going to be a circus, and the media’s alarmism proves it.

Texto completo: White House Roundup
WASHINGTON - The whistleblower who raised concerns about President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine spoke to staffers on the House Intelligence Committee before filing a formal complaint, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations of wrongdoing that triggered their impeachment inquiry.
The whistleblower, a member of the intelligence community, contacted the committee for guidance on how to report "possible wrongdoing," according to Patrick Boland, a spokesman for the Intelligence Committee's chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Boland said that "at no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance" and that it is a regular occurrence for whistleblowers to seek guidance from the committee.
The New York Times first reported the interaction.
The revelation that Democrats had spoken to the whistleblower, whose identity is not publicly known, added a new detail to the sequence of events surrounding the complaint. It could explain why Schiff quickly sounded alarm when the acting director of national intelligence withheld the complaint from Congress last month.
The report filed to Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, claimed that Trump was "using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country" in the election. That accusation hinged, in part, on a conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in which Trump asked the foreign leader to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his family. There's been no evidence of wrongdoing by either Biden.
Trump, who has repeatedly described the call as "perfect," seized on the whistleblower's contact with the intelligence panel to amplify his criticism of Schiff and the impeachment investigation.
"It shows that Schiff is a fraud," Trump said at a news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto shortly after the New York Times published the story.
Schiff said in a tweet that when a whistleblower seeks guidance, staff advises them to obtain a lawyer and go to an inspector general.
"That's what they're supposed to do," Schiff tweeted. "Unlike a president pressing a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent. That's not what a president is supposed to do."
Lawmakers are negotiating to hear from the whistleblower, but obtaining the person's testimony has been complicated by fears for the person's safety. Trump has said he wants to know who the whistleblower is.
Trump eggs China
to investigate Bidens
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday publicly encouraged China to investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden, snubbing his nose at an impeachment inquiry into whether a similar, private appeal to another foreign government violated his oath of office.
Trump declared at the White House, "China should start an investigation into the Bidens." He said he hadn't previously asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to investigate the former vice president and his son Hunter, but it's "certainly something we could start thinking about."
By publicly egging on China, Trump was amplifying the message he'd delivered in private to the president of Ukraine. That message, revealed by a government whistleblower, has spawned the impeachment investigation by the House. Trump, who has defended his contact with Ukraine as "perfect," went further in expanding his request to China, a communist world power that has much at stake in its relationship with the United States in an ongoing trade war.
The boldness of Trump's call Thursday also suggests he will continue to act as though requests for other countries to investigate potential opponents in the 2020 election are normal, even in the face of broad condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans. It's a tactic Trump has used successfully before, pushing questionable secret conversations into the open, helping to inoculate him against charges that he is engaged in nefarious action, cover-ups or obstruction of justice.
Trump doubled down on his comments later Thursday, saying in a tweet: "As the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!"

Texto completo: United States Since 2009, euthanasia rates for cats and dogs in city-run shelters have dropped 75%. Willingness to adopt pets is increasing as some say adoption has become a badge of honor. And the no-kill movement is proving to be successful; advocates have pushed shelters to pursue alternatives such as releasing after spaying or neutering. Efforts to track and compile shelter records nationwide are promoting transparency, but shelter representatives note many shelters face impossible expectations and are doing the best that they can. (The New York Times)
Bangladesh The country has a new approach for protecting its rivers: It is granting them legal rights. Bangladesh has one of the largest networks of rivers in the world – nearly 700. The country’s Supreme Court ruled that every river has a right to life, and people can be taken to court if they are found guilty of causing harm. Advocates say this is a victory for legal defense against environmental damage. While other countries such as India and New Zealand have granted rights to specific bodies of water, Bangladesh’s new rule applies to all rivers. The government said it is figuring out how to enforce river rights and support communities that rely on the rivers for fishing and farming. Human rights activists are still concerned that the legislation will lead to evictions of people living in informal settlements and slums. (Vox)
Jamaica Collaboration among the ocean’s stakeholders is helping coral make a comeback. Beginning in the 1980s, Jamaica lost 85% of its vibrant coral reef ecosystem from natural disasters and overfishing, and many scientists thought that it was too late for recovery. But thanks to grassroots organizations and no-fish zones, corals and fish are slowly reappearing. Two years ago, a marine association of businesses and fishers came together and negotiated boundaries of a no-fish zone along the coast. More fishers are getting on board with the zones once they’ve seen fish populations rebound. (The Associated Press)
Kazakhstan The new president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is allowing activists to protest. The Central Asian nation has long prohibited public protests, but members of a youth-led movement were allowed to hold rallies calling for constitutional reform in several Kazakh cities on Constitution Day this August. In the past, police would detain protesters or interfere with marches. President Tokayev reportedly is showing more leniency toward dissident groups, and invited critics to discuss reforms at a special council meeting. (Reuters)
England Worcestershire County is welcoming back light-shy bats. After learning that some bat species will avoid flying near bright white streetlights, the county decided to install red LEDs along nearly 200 feet of highway by the local Warndon Wood nature reserve. The red-tone corridor allows bats and other nocturnal wildlife to reach key water and food sources undisturbed, and is completely safe for motorists and pedestrians. Similar systems have worked in the Netherlands, but this is reportedly the first installment of its kind in the U.K. (Worcester News)

Texto completo: James Norman, who headed Rochester's Action for a Better Community for 25 years, remembers when a musical band came to his Georgia home in the 1960s hoping to enlist his teenage sister as a singer.
His sister, Jessye, was then 15 or so, and word was beginning to spread of the vocal talents and the remarkable range she displayed at church. Three years his sister's junior, James Norman was in the front yard when members of the band strode up to the Norman home and asked whether Jessye could travel to Tennessee to record an album.
"I was excited that someone wanted her to go make a record," James Norman, now 71, said Wednesday in a telephone conversation. "That was a big deal."
Their father, Silas Norman Sr., never let the group advance into the Augusta, Georgia, home.
"He talked to them through the screen door and basically said she was going nowhere with them," James Norman remembered.
Part of that was the protective nature of a father. But there was another reason, James Norman said. "He had a sense that her talent was bigger than what they needed."
In that, the Norman family patriarch was so right.
Jessye Norman died this week at age 74, remembered internationally as a renowned and regal opera star who could maneuver through both the dramatic theatricality and the more subtle nuances of Wagnerian productions.
Her voluptuous and rich voice — one The New York Times this week described as a "distinctly opulent tone that sounded effortless" — commanded stages around the world, whether performing Wagner, Strauss or other operatic stalwarts.
Jessye Norman died from septic shock and multiple organ failure following complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015, her family said.
Megastar soprano Renée Fleming, who grew up in the Rochester area, tweeted about Norman's death: "What a stunning, saddening loss today." In the tweet, Fleming linked to a classic live recording of Norman singing the Liebestod from Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde."
"This gives just an inkling of Jessye Norman's vocal, artistic, and personal magnificence," Fleming wrote of the performance.
Homage to Marian Anderson Because of James Norman's role at Action for Better Community, or ABC, Jessye Norman sometimes traveled to Rochester for visits and for fundraisers for the longtime nonprofit, which works with the community's low-income residents.
In 2013, she and Garth Fagan Dance joined to present "The African American Cultural Legacy" at Eastman Theatre to raise money for ABC.
That very legacy is where Jessye Norman and her siblings started, with singing in Georgia church choirs and a deep appreciation for Negro spirituals. Jessye Norman would often end solo performances with those songs, an homage, according to her brother, to the life and singing career of Marian Anderson, another African American woman.
While as a youngster Jessye Norman embraced the resilient leitmotifs of gospel, she also found herself as a teenager drawn to music of another sort.
"On Saturdays, when she was doing housework, she'd be listening to the opera on the radio," James Norman said. "That sort of exposed her at an early age to that type of music and she gravitated toward it.
"It was a personal connection between her and that type of music because the type of music we were mostly exposed to at that age was church music."
When she was a teenager a music instructor saw her talents. Jessye Norman traveled to New York for a competition, and stopped at Howard University in Washington, D.C. There, she auditioned, and, her brother said, the career truly was seeded.
She entered Howard University on a full-tuition scholarship at 16 years old, and graduated cum laude in 1967. She continued her studies at the Peabody Conservatory and the University of Michigan.
"At Howard we began to get a sense that she could actually make a living singing," James Norman said.
That turned out to be an understatement. Throughout her six-decade career, Norman would win five Grammys, a Kennedy Center Honor and a National Medal of the Arts, and would receive more than 30 honorary degrees.
James Norman retired from ABC in 2017. As well as hosting his sister locally, he would travel to some of performances through the years.
In her visits to Rochester, she often reminded those to whom she sang and to whom she spoke about the country's history of slavery, and the strength and power of music as an answer to oppression.
When speaking to local middle and high school students here in 2013, she told of how Marian Anderson had been denied the chance to sing in Constitution Hall in 1939 because she was black. Eleanor Roosevelt, angered by the slight, intervened and had Anderson sing in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
"You can't possibly know where you are if you don't know where you've been," Jessye Norman told the students.

Layoffs Follow Transfer of Sports Illustrated's Control

Texto completo: Sports Illustrated, which set a standard for sportswriting and photography during its 20th-century heyday, was transferred to a new company Thursday. Along with the change, there were layoffs, according to three people with knowledge of the moves.
The number of those who lost their jobs under the magazine's new steward, Maven, a digital platform company in Seattle, was not immediately clear. Before the layoffs, there were 31 full-time employees at the magazine who belonged to the NewsGuild union and nearly 80 employees who worked at the Sports Illustrated website.
Journalists at the 65-year-old publication arrived at the office in Lower Manhattan on Thursday not knowing whether or not they would have jobs by the end of the day. By evening, after cardboard boxes appeared, some of them had been laid off, the people said.
In a statement, Maven said it planned to "refocus" Sports Illustrated for a January relaunch, adding that it would "strengthen mobile platform delivery and increase the development of complementary video content."
Maven also said much of the coverage would shift to a network of bloggers, known as Sports Illustrated Mavens, who would cover up to 200 college and professional teams.
Sports Illustrated has changed hands more than once in recent years.
In 2018, it became the property of Meredith, the venerable Des Moines publisher of Family Circle and of Better Homes and Gardens, after that company bought Time Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $ 2.8 billion.
Meredith quickly sought buyers for Sports Illustrated, which was not a fit for its stable of women's and lifestyle publications. It found a taker in a New York brand management company, Authentic Brands Group, which owns the commercial rights to celebrities including Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, as well as retailers like Juicy Couture.
The $ 110 million deal went through in May, giving Authentic Brands Group the magazine's archive of photographs and covers, as well as its Sportsperson of the Year and swimsuit issue franchises. Under the arrangement, Meredith was to continue operating the website and biweekly print magazine. Then Authentic Brands Group sold that license to Maven.
On Thursday, the transfer was completed, Meredith said in a statement.
"As the new licenser of Sports Illustrated, Maven made the Sports Illustrated personnel decisions that Meredith communicated to the SI employees today," the statement said. "Going forward, the remaining SI employees will work at the direction and at the pleasure of Maven."
The NewsGuild expressed its concerns in a letter that it made public before the layoffs on Thursday, questioning whether the job cuts would "not only be sudden and devastating to the staff directly impacted, but severely compromise the ability of the remaining staff to put out a quality product, thus imperiling the future of Sports Illustrated."
A group of Sports Illustrated staff members also objected to having Maven at the helm. They said in a statement that the company "wants to replace top journalists in the industry with a network of Maven freelancers and bloggers, while reducing or eliminating departments that have ensured that the stories we publish and produce meet the highest standards."
In June, Maven named Ross Levinsohn the chief executive of Sports Illustrated. Mr. Levinsohn, previously an executive at News Corporation and Yahoo, was formerly the publisher of The Los Angeles Times during a period of unrest in the newsroom.
On Tuesday, in an email obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Levinsohn told the Sports Illustrated staff that Chris Stone, a 27-year veteran of the magazine and its editor in chief, would leave the publication, but was "considering an offer" from Maven. Mr. Stone did not respond to requests for comment.
In Mr. Stone's place, two staff members, Steve Cannella and Ryan Hunt, were elevated to co-editors in chief, the email said.
"We care deeply -- as we know all of you do -- about the excellent work SI does and the power and prestige it carries for us, our audience and for the people we cover," Mr. Levinsohn wrote.
Through a spokesman, Mr. Levinsohn declined to comment on Thursday.
In an email to the staff on Wednesday, Mr. Cannella and Mr. Hunt said, "Our goal is simple: to double down on the best of what Sports Illustrated has always been known for -- unparalleled journalism and powerful storytelling -- while creating a new company that's built for success in the 21st century and beyond."

Texto completo: NEW DELHI - India is marking the 150th birthday of Mohandas Gandhi, the man known as the father of the nation, and across the country there are exhibits, commemorations, marches, prisoner releases and even a 1,000-foot-long greeting card.
But the celebrations this week mask a deeper unease. A century and a half after the birth of the revered leader of India's independence struggle, Gandhi and his legacy are getting an update - and much of it is not positive.
Even as admiration for Gandhi remains widespread, aspects of his life and philosophy are increasingly a source of controversy. Scholars have highlighted the racist language he used as a young man living in South Africa, as well as his defense of India's caste system.
On the other side of the political spectrum, India's right-leaning Hindu nationalist ideologues have long had an ambivalent relationship with Gandhi. Some view his dedication to nonviolence as a form of weakness, or think he betrayed the cause of Hindus with his support for religious pluralism. Earlier this year, one politician from the ruling party even described the man who assassinated Gandhi as a "patriot."
In many parts of the world, "Gandhi is seen broadly as a nice, decent, open-minded, reasonable guy who advocated nonviolence, justice, peace and so on," said Ramachandra Guha, a historian and author of a two-volume biography of Gandhi. But in India, "his ideas and legacy have been deeply contested."
Gandhi is often given the title "Mahatma," or "great soul," and many in India refer to him simply as "Bapu," a word for father. He inspired leaders such as Nelson Mandela and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who wrote that Gandhi served as a "continual reminder" that "it is possible to resist evil and yet not resort to violence."
But in his long life in the public eye - his collected works comprise nearly 100 volumes - Gandhi delved into not only politics but also economics, religion, sexuality, sanitation and even diet.
One recent critique centers on Gandhi's two decades in South Africa as a younger man. During that time, he repeatedly referred to black South Africans using a racial slur and described them as inferior to Indians, views that prompted a university in Ghana to remove a statue of Gandhi late last year.
A growing number of writers and scholars have also criticized Gandhi for his views on India's caste system, saying he was a conservative who believed in preserving hereditary roles for different caste groups in Indian society rather than eradicating them.
Gandhi denounced the practice of treating certain people as "untouchable" or somehow polluting. Yet he also believed in having a "harmonious social order," said Anand Teltumbde, one of India's preeminent scholars on caste and the author of a recent manuscript on Gandhi. "The caste system provided that order," Teltumbde said.
Other scholars say Gandhi advocated a gradual reform of the system because he did not want to alienate the upper castes, which were crucial to the independence struggle.
On Wednesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Gandhi at an event in Gujarat, the home state of both men. Gandhi was an advocate for better sanitation, and Modi is using his 150th birthday to celebrate the government's "Clean India" campaign, which has constructed millions of toilets nationwide. Modi has said the program has helped India's rural areas essentially eradicate the practice of defecating outside, although experts cast doubt on that claim.
Modi also praised Gandhi in an opinion piece published in the New York Times on Wednesday, saluting him for giving "courage to millions globally" and for envisioning "a world where every citizen has dignity and prosperity." Modi challenged "thinkers, entrepreneurs and tech leaders" to find innovative ways to spread Gandhi's ideas.
Modi's emphasis on honoring Gandhi in association with the cleanliness campaign strikes some of those who knew him as a strategic choice. Although Gandhi did advocate improved sanitation, they say, it was not his central message.
"Those connected to the current Indian regime are using a fragment of Gandhi to destroy the core of Gandhi," said his grandson Rajmohan Gandhi, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "The core of Gandhi is equality and especially minority rights."
Modi "exalts Gandhi as a prophet of cleanliness and recycling," added Guha, Gandhi's biographer. "He never talks about what Gandhi lived and died for, which was Hindu-Muslim harmony."
Gandhi was assassinated in January 1948 by Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist. Godse was a former member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist organization that is the ideological parent of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. (Modi spent much of his life as a full-time RSS worker.)
In May, Pragya Thakur, days before she was elected to India's Parliament for the BJP, hailed Godse as a "patriot." Modi said Thakur's remarks were "condemnable" and she apologized, but the party ultimately took no action against her.
Some rue the fact that Gandhi is becoming irrelevant in today's India. He has been reduced to "a ritualistic presence in our collective life," Apoorvanand, a professor at Delhi University who goes by only one name, wrote this month. "He has been made a lifestyle guru, a feel-good presence - something he never was." To embrace Gandhi would mean reviving "a politics of dissent . . . which sometimes requires going against one's own people."
When Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi, his grandson Rajmohan was 12. Now Rajmohan is 84, older than Gandhi was when he died. Rajmohan said he took heart from a recent video of an Indian high school student reciting a poem praising Gandhi that went viral.
"There is a stubborn core of people who have understood him and know that Gandhi represents the better angels of the Indian nature," said Rajmohan. Gandhi is "not finished in India - no, sir."

Adam Schiff’s rocky impeachment launch fuels GOP pushback

Texto completo: Republicans and President Trump, eager to discredit the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats, may have found their weapon in Adam Schiff.
Schiff, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, was tasked last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi with leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's efforts to get foreign governments to investigate allegations against 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.
But Schiff, 59, could be helping the GOP weaken the case for impeachment by making critical missteps that Republicans and Trump believe undermine the Democrats' case against the president.
Reports surfaced last week that members of Schiff's committee staff spoke with the whistleblower before the bombshell complaint was filed with the Intelligence Community inspector general who launched the impeachment inquiry. The reports directly contradicted Schiff, when during a Sept. 17 appearance on MSNBC, he proclaimed, "We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower."
The revelation raised serious questions about whether Democrats coordinated with the whistleblower or even aided in writing the whistleblower complaint. While the attorney for the whistleblower flatly denied Democrats had any role in writing the complaint, Schiff's dissembling hurt his credibility.
Republicans seized on the information, revealed to the New York Times, as proof that Democrats are orchestrating the allegations against the president to fuel their effort to impeach him.
"We learn from the press today that Chairman Schiff had prior knowledge and involvement in the whistleblower complaint," Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said. "He withheld this information from the American people and even from the Intelligence Committee. In light of this news, it's hard to view impeachment as anything aside from an orchestrated farce."
Trump, who long ago assigned Schiff the nickname "Shifty Schiff," delivered a decisive blow against him at a widely televised Oct. 2 press conference that commenced just as the New York Times story broke.
"It shows that Schiff is a fraud," Trump said.
He accused Schiff of helping to write the whistleblower complaint, which Schiff and his staff flatly deny.
Trump made the case that Schiff's prior knowledge of the whistleblower underscores a pattern Democrats are following to try to undermine his presidency, first by accusing him of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election.
That allegation led to a two-year investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller that found no evidence Trump colluded with the Russians.
"The whole thing is a scam," Trump said. "The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam."
Pelosi, in late September, turned to Schiff to take over the Trump investigation after the House Judiciary Committee, headed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, botched the effort.
Nadler had declared last summer that he was conducting his own impeachment proceedings and did so without receiving Pelosi's blessing to label it as such.
Nadler expanded his investigation again and again to include a multitude of allegations against Trump, including whether he paid hush money to an adult film star and Playboy model when he was running for president. Nadler's hearings featured combative witnesses and theatrics from lawmakers and were largely criticized by both parties.
Pelosi chose Schiff in part to bring integrity and credibility to a much narrower impeachment inquiry than Nadler was conducting.
But Schiff may have stumbled out of the gate.
Many believe Schiff bungled his inaugural impeachment hearing when he read aloud his fictitious account of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
The phone call is the centerpiece of the Democrats' impeachment inquiry because the rough transcript shows Trump had asked Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations involving the Democratic National Committee and Biden.
But Schiff made up his own, more sinister dialogue of the conversation and read it aloud during his opening statement.
"I have a favor I want from you," Schiff said as he sat at the hearing room dais and appeared to be reading from the call transcript. "And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that."
The stunt left Republicans outraged, and it provoked so much criticism from the traditionally Schiff-friendly media punditry that Schiff moved quickly to clarify that his opening statement was a "parody."
But Schiff's fake phone call dialogue may have irrevocably damaged the integrity of the impeachment investigation, which has already been undermined by Pelosi's decision to forgo a formal vote to open the inquiry, which bucked decades of precedent. Republicans have labeled the entire impeachment inquiry "a parody" and have called on Pelosi to drop it.
Last week, Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona introduced a resolution to censure Schiff over his parody opening statement. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, is a co-sponsor.
"I don't think Schiff is the guy who should be leading an impeachment inquiry," Biggs, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told the Washington Examiner. "He's disqualified himself."

Gail Collins: On Trump, you can’t trust Romney to stay the course

Texto completo: Down with Republican wimps.
You know the ones. They’re trying to avoid taking on Donald Trump while looking sort of sad about the way our president wanted to trade military aid to another country for dirt on a political opponent.
Or just evading. “I don’t know what law he’s violated yet,” said Sen. Rick Scott of Florida.
This is not really to the point, given that Congress can remove a president for a terrible misuse of power that isn’t literally against a law. And if Scott’s goal was to dodge the whole matter, he certainly lost. On Wednesday, Trump said his but-about-Biden’s-son talk with the president of Ukraine was above reproach, adding, “I heard Rick Scott say that was a perfect conversation.”
Floridians, feel free to put up posters with that quote all over your neighborhoods.
It would take 67 senators to convict Trump if the House votes to impeach. That’s quite a lift given that the Republicans control the chamber 53-47. A lot of them are terrified that if they vote against the president, some Trump-loving jerk from Fred County will run against them in a primary, sending them off to a career lobbying for pharmaceutical companies way earlier than they anticipated.
So far the expressions of outrage are pretty darned muted. Well, Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska did call the Ukraine story “troubling.”
People, which of these things could be reasonably defined as “troubling”?
A) Evidence that the president used his position to extort a rather helpless ally for the basest possible political motives.
B) A president who appeared to threaten to execute anyone who helped out a whistleblower.
C) A delay in implementation of highway fund appropriations.
Romney is the senator from Utah, a job he could keep if he got caught torturing puppies. This was not meant to remind you of the time he drove to Canada with the family Irish setter in a crate on the station wagon’s roof. Time editor Anand Giridharadas already took care of that when he tweeted, “Mitt, it is time to strap the dog of courage onto the car of your constitutional obligations.”
Romney sees himself as a leader who’s going to bring back the old, good-mannered, classic-conservative version of the Republican Party. Which would certainly be lovely. But you can’t trust him to stay the course. He’s the guy who began running for the Senate blasting Trump’s “message of exclusion.” Later, when he needed more right-wing support, he began bragging that he was “more of a hawk on immigration than even the president.”
So feel free to tweet up a storm.
The awfulness of the Trump protectors may just drive a few principled Republicans off the team. For instance, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been comparing the impeachment movement to the Salem witch trials and demanding that the whistleblower be forced to go public. Nobody wants to be referred to as “very much in the tradition of Lindsey Graham.”
In response to Graham’s tirade, Senate president pro tempore Chuck Grassley of Iowa issued a statement demanding the whistleblower be “heard out and protected.” Grassley is a much-respected veteran, and it would be nice to see him go further. Even if a few cynics point out that he’s 86 years old and isn’t up for reelection until 2022.
And wait — how about Mitch McConnell? The Senate majority leader has been saying that even if there has to be an impeachment debate, it doesn’t have to be, you know, long.
“If it gets to the Senate, it will be up to every senator, especially the Republicans, to make sure Sen. McConnell conducts it fairly and down the middle — this is too important not to do that,” Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview.
Schumer is being very diplomatic. McConnell has approximately as much history of being fair and down the middle as Attila the Hun. If he thought he could get away with it, McConnell would schedule the Senate debate for 3 to 4 o’clock on Thanksgiving morning.
We’ve heard lots of calls on Congress to behave more like the Founding Fathers in recent weeks. Which F.F. do you think Mitch McConnell most resembles? I put that question to several historians, and they found it to be a real stumper. “You could argue John Adams is a little bit like Mitch McConnell,” William Galston of the Brookings Institution said reluctantly. Both men, he pointed out, were “stubborn, confident and highly partisan.” However, it’s tough to imagine Abigail Adams being accused of using her political connections to boost her family’s business interests, like a certain majority leader’s spouse.
“I can’t think of anyone who’s like him,” said Joanne Freeman of Yale. The question of who might play McConnell in a “Hamilton”-type production about Trump impeachment stumped her, too. (“Oh my gosh — a McConnell musical. Wow.”)
I am considering the guy who does Mr. Smithers’ voice on “The Simpsons.”
There’s a suspicion in Washington that a lot of Senate Republicans would be happy to turn on the president if there were some kind of super-secret impeachment ballot. This is probably true. How many of them would even want to have lunch with Donald Trump if he were, say, a school custodian?
Not even Lindsey Graham.

Texto completo: Ask the typical employee what they most want from their jobs ...
Go ahead; do it. I'll wait right here.
Chances are, the most frequent answer you received was something along the lines of "the sense of satisfaction that comes with working hard to help people solve problems that make their lives better."
In other words, they want "money. Lots and lots of money."
Ask me what I want from a job and you'll get an altogether different answer.
I want to be left alone.
I'm an introvert, and there are plenty more like me. You don't know this important factoid because we introverts are stealth employees -- or try to be. Our goal is to never be asked a question, never stand up in a meeting and never have to talk to our co-workers, our managers and, most of all, that nosy parker, Dennis, from IT.
To an introvert, the best thing a manager can say about you is "the name's not familiar. Do they work here?"
All of which proves what your mother told you: "To be successful is wonderful. To be anonymous is even better."
Ethan Hauser is a self-confessed introvert and the author of "The Plight of the Office Introvert," a recent article in The New York Times.
According to the Times, lots of people are introverts. "Some say we may make up 25 percent of the population," Hauser writes, "while others say the ratio is roughly 50-50."
There is much about the office environment that Hauser does not like. He does not like "orientation breakfasts, trust falls, should we whiteboard it?, team-building yoga, team-building karaoke, team building in general."
He especially doesn't like brainstorming, and who can blame him? No introvert wants a bunch of weirdo workplace strangers storming the shadowy corners of their brains. Makes sense, yes? We introverts don't want to be forced to answer intrusive questions, like "How are you?" or "Can you lend me a paper clip?" We certainly don't want our co-workers marching through our subconscious in 10-gallon gumboots.
While Hauser is very clear about what introverts don't want to do, which is everything and anything that demands interaction with other human people, when it comes to creative strategies introverts can use to protect their basic human right to be invisible, he comes up short.
Fortunately, as an extremely outgoing introvert, I can provide the strategies that will provide shelter from the storm of snoopy colleagues and buttinsky managers.
Strategy No. 1: Stop coming to work.
More companies today are willing to let you work from home -- or, in your case, not work from home. This makes all kinds of sense. Why should your employer pay for expensive office space for you to goof off in? You can be just as unproductive in your own home and save your company the money it would otherwise spend on electricity, heat and salty snacks.
Best of all, when you're at home, there's no one who is going to demand you interact with them. Except Oprah, Ellen, Maury, Julie, Wendy and Dr. Phil. They're annoying, you bet, but when they start getting personal, you can always turn them off. You can't do that with Mary-Sue from HR.
Strategy No. 2: Wear office camouflage.
Hunters who want to sneak up on their prey will dress in camouflage. That means green-colored clothing which hides you behind realistic designs of trees, plants and spiders. The same principle applies to office camouflage, which hides you behind realistic designs of workstations, copying machines and, of course, spiders.
If you really don't want to be noticed, come to work naked. People will see you, but they won't remember it. The sight of naked you bending over the watercooler will be so horrible, it will sizzle their little brains.
Strategy No. 3: Tell everyone EVERYTHING
This won't be easy. You will need to ingest a mind-altering substance to turn your brain inside out. (Ayahuasca works. So does scarfing a half-dozen cinnamon buns.)
The strategy is to temporarily transform yourself from a meek introvert, who never says anything to anyone, into a loud-mouth extravert who never shuts up. Fill the workday with stories of your experiences in summer camp. Regale your co-workers with the secrets of Hummel collecting. Call everyone together and explain, with a detailed PowerPoint, why you think Billie Eilish represents the sonic evolution of Paula Abdul.
If you can chat your way through one blabbermouth workday, you'll be safe. No one will want to interact with you ever again.

Texto completo: En los últimos días surgió la noticia de que el presidente Donald Trump habría sugerido disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes para tratar de frenar su llegada a Estados Unidos. Las presuntas declaraciones se habrían hecho en marzo pasado.
Aunque el presidente niega haber dicho tal aseveración , independientemente de si son ciertas o falsas, distintas organizaciones proinmigrantes han manifestado su rechazo a esas palabras, ya que consideran que esto solamente eleva un odio que podría generar más violencia.
Por medio de un comunicado, la Red Fronteriza de Derechos Humanos ( BNHR , por sus siglas en inglés) dice no estar de acuerdo con la supuesta declaración, la cual fue publicada en un informe de The New York Times basado en entrevistas con fuentes no identificadas.
“Sugerir que alguien que está tratando de cruzar la frontera debe recibir un disparo en las piernas es una declaración tan espantosa y desagradable en sí misma, pero que lo haga el hombre que se sienta en la oficina más alta de este país es alucinante y nos muestra cuán lejos de lo normal nos hemos desviado”, comentó el director ejecutivo de BNHR, Fernando García.
García agregó que las personas que vienen a Estados Unidos solamente buscan proporcionar alimento a sus familias y huir de la violencia vivida en sus países de origen, por lo que en caso de ser cierta la declaración, sería un “castigo horrible” y citó la masacre ocurrida recientemente en El Paso.
“Hace solo unas semanas, un supremacista blanco que defiende la retórica de Trump abrió fuego y mató a 22 personas en un Walmart local. El presidente incita a la violencia entre sus seguidores y no tiene en cuenta la vida humana. Este es el tipo de lenguaje que trafica. Oramos para que los inmigrantes y todos los que viven a lo largo de la frontera se mantengan a salvo de los vigilantes rebeldes provocados por las palabras de Trump ”, acotó García.
Al respecto, el director de America’s Voice, Mario Carrillo , consideró que una declaración como esa solo promociona la violencia y normaliza la “peligrosa cosmovisión” de la supremacía blanca. Además de calificar como “destructivos” dichos comentarios.
“Hace dos meses, un supremacista blanco viajó a través de Texas a mi ciudad natal de El Paso y mató a 22 personas e hirió a dos docenas más en un Wal-Mart local. No fue una coincidencia que un tirador preocupado por una “invasión hispana” eligiera aterrorizar a esta ciudad de mayoría latina ni que la violencia tuviera lugar mientras Trump se concentraba en los refugiados y solicitantes de asilo en la frontera”, dijo Carrillo mientras también recordaba el ataque de Pittsburgh.
“Hace casi un año, un supremacista blanco obsesionado con la ‘teoría del reemplazo’ mató a 11 personas en la sinagoga Tree of Life en Pittsburgh después de que el presidente Trump hizo de la ‘caravana de migrantes’ su enfoque obsesivo en las últimas semanas de las elecciones de mitad de período. Por supuesto, el lenguaje de Trump de castigar a las personas y violentar a los inmigrantes no es solo una retórica peligrosa que incita: son ideas fundamentales para las políticas de la administración diseñadas para mantener alejados y expulsar a los inmigrantes y las personas de color y sus persistentes intentos de avivar las brechas a lo largo de líneas raciales y étnicas”, agregó Carrillo.
Por su parte, el presidente Trump utilizó su cuenta de Twitter para negar que sugirió disparar a las piernas de los inmigrantes, además de rechazar que quería construir el muro en la frontera con picos y corriente eléctrica.
“Ahora la prensa está tratando de vender el hecho de que quería una fosa rellena de caimanes y serpientes, con una cerca electrificada y puntas afiladas en la parte superior, en nuestra frontera sur. Puedo ser duro con la seguridad fronteriza, pero no tan duro. La prensa se ha vuelto loca. ¡Noticias falsas! ”, escribió el mandatario.
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!

Texto completo: The delivery boy for the Minneapolis Star tossed the first edition of the Taste section at my family's front door, and that of other subscribers, on Wednesday afternoon, Oct. 1, 1969.
Fifty years later, it's available every day online and on Thursdays and Sundays in print.
That first issue was a significant moment in the Twin Cities food world, though no one realized it at the time. In fact, whether those food pages would be of interest was in question.
Its first editor, Beverly Kees, in a 2004 interview, noted that the late '60s were a time when "food was becoming chic, not just something you needed in order to live."
As important to both readers and the newspaper, a weekly section was a way to package food ads in one place, hence the Wednesday appearance, which is when grocery specials were announced.
Although a food section would seem like a sure bet, the editors in charge were practical, if not confident, as they created the Star's first stand-alone weekly section. They chose a title that could be repurposed if necessary. If readers weren't interested in food, the pages could reflect Taste as a furnishings or decorating section, or even a fashion section.
While the grocery ads made Taste irresistible (there were plenty of coupons on those pages), the writing, both personal and humorous, may have endeared it to readers. "We tried to keep things amusing, so that Taste would be fun to read even if you didn't plan to cook whatever we were writing about," Kees said in that same interview.
"We tried to give everyone -- men, women and children -- a reason to look at it."
A steady stream of local celebrities landed on its pages. Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby, who lived in the Twin Cities) offered her coconut cake recipe. Twins manager Billy Martin provided his for spaghetti and brazzoli. Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra, noted, "Every orchestra has its gourmets. The better the musician, probably the better the gourmet."
Taste has had its longtime fans. On the occasion of the 40th birthday celebration of the section, the son of one loyal reader who was 97 called to say his mother had saved all four decades of the section in her closet.
Those 2,080 issues, give or take the occasional missing one, were saved for the recipes. "I'm not interested in another way to make macaroni and cheese," she said. "I'm looking for something different, some variety." And she found that in Taste.
Recipes in a newspaper were not themselves new when food sections began appearing across the country in the late '60s and '70s. They had showed up sporadically for almost as long as there was newsprint. One early mention appeared in the Minneapolis Tribune in 1888, in an article called "Gossip About Books," where not one, but two cookbooks were reviewed.
The occasional recipes in newspapers got a boost after World War II with the appearance of reader exchange columns -- when one reader asked others for a recipe -- often found in what were then called the "Women's Pages."
By the mid-1980s, most newspapers had traded that multipurpose catchall for its female audience to a focus on food coverage in lifestyle and food sections.
"The shift to food sections came out of the 1950s consumer culture," said Prof. Kimberly Wilmot Voss, who teaches journalism at the University of Central Florida and wrote "The Food Section: Newspaper Women and the Culinary Community."
"The stand-alone sections had a lot of grocery store ads that funded other parts of the newspaper, even though they never got credit for it," said Voss. "Until the early 1970s, it was mostly women who ran them."
Today, with dwindling grocery ads, many of those stand-alone food sections around the country have been folded into features section, where their content has been minimized. The exceptions are the large-circulation newspapers that have thrown their weight into expanding food coverage, from the New York Times to the Washington Post, as well as the Los Angeles Times, which recently brought back its stand-alone section after a seven-year absence.
"After teaching more than 20 years, I've never seen journalism students more excited about writing about food and beyond recipes," said Voss. "For this generation of journalists, food is as important as anything else, which is how it should have been."
So who had the first stand-alone food section? It appears that the Chicago Tribune can claim that honor, with its stand-alone section dating to 1953, and an in-house test kitchen, that continues today.
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (which, like the Star Tribune, joined its competitor) also began in the mid-1950s. Other publications followed suit much later.
Today we celebrate 50 years of nonstop coverage in Taste.

Detailing the dogged reporting that brought down Weinstein

Texto completo: It was the story that ignited the #MeToo movement two years ago: “Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades."
Now The New York Times reporters who broke the story, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, have written a book called “She Said" that details how they were able to coax victims to finally speak on the record. For writers, the book serves as a master class in investigative journalism. For everyone else, it's a reminder that meticulous reporting is at the heart of real news.
Kantor and Twohey will be at First Parish Church in Cambridge on Monday with actress Ashley Judd, who is at the Harvard Kennedy School this academic year, focusing on gender issues. Judd was one of the first actresses to go on the record and accuse the Hollywood mogul of sexual misconduct.
The conversation with Judd, Kantor said, will be a “rare chance for us to really talk about what happened behind the scenes and also to talk about the journalist-source relationship and how that evolved."
Here is an edited transcript of my conversation with Kantor and Twohey:
Q. What's the freshest revelation in your book that deepens the Weinstein story?
Twohey: We were able to pull the curtain back more on the machinery that was in place to silence women and help Weinstein evade scrutiny. There were individuals in the institutions that got glimpses of Weinstein's alleged predatory behavior over the years, and in some cases tried to stop it or looked the other way. We were able to illuminate the role of the Weinstein Co., including Harvey Weinstein's brother Bob, who had been one of the most perplexing figures to us coming out of the initial story. This was Weinstein's sibling and longtime business partner.
For the first time, in this book, Bob opens up and acknowledges he was aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against his brother, going back decades. He provided money that helped silence two of the women who came forward, but like so many people in Weinstein's orbit Bob believed his brother when he claimed that those were shakedowns and extramarital affairs and nothing more.
Q. Other journalists over the years tried to break the Weinstein sexual-misconduct story but failed. What was the turning point for you?
Kantor: One of the reasons we wanted to write this book was to show how surprising it was — who helped and who hindered, both in terms of the overall Weinstein story and our investigation. It turns out that we had a “deep throat" figure who emerged in our investigation named Irwin Reiter, a company accountant for 30 years. He had tried starting in 2014 to confront the problem internally and had been unsuccessful. He gave us critical information, documents, and the knowledge of more recent incidents that had unfolded inside the company.
Q. Megan, before the Weinstein story, you in 2016 covered the alleged sexual misconduct of Donald Trump. Why do sexual-misconduct allegations dethrone some men, and others get to keep their jobs or even get promoted?
Twohey: Jodi and I have spent a lot of time talking about that, and it's worth noting that, yes, our book starts in 2016, with the reporting that I did on women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump, moves onto the Weinstein investigation, and then pushes through into the year that followed and up through Christine Blasey Ford coming forward with her allegation against [now Supreme Court Justice] Brett Kavanaugh.
What we have seen time and time again is that when women make allegations in the political realm against political figures or within a political context of any kind, that it quickly descends into holy war, with both sides taking up arms against each other. Oftentimes the women are almost being forgotten.
Q. Why did your story, in particular, break the dam on sexual harassment?
Kantor: So many contributing factors have been building up for years and years, from Anita Hill's testimony to Tarana Burke's founding of the Me Too movement to the Bill Cosby story. The Bill O'Reilly story became our in-house tutorial on how to trace a legal and financial trail to help document these kinds of allegations.
As one of our editors, Matt Purdy, has pointed out, the Weinstein story was one of the first times when the accusers had more credibility and prestige than the accused. Famous actresses had so much credibility and respect in society that learning that this could happen to even them was really potent. But the Weinstein story is not just about one alleged predator — it's an X-ray of how power works. That's why this story is just forcing us even two years later to still reckon with all these moral questions.
Q. A recent study found women felt even more hostility in the workplace than two years ago. Is that concerning to you?
Twohey: It's clear that in two years both the accusers and the accused feel like there has not been adequate reforms to ensure that complaints of sexual harassment are addressed. There are three outstanding questions that we try to highlight in this book. One: There has not been agreement over what behaviors should merit scrutiny. Are we only talking about really serious rape and sexual harassment, or are we talking also about bad dates? [Two:] What is the fair process by which complaints can be vetted? And, thirdly, what does accountability look like and how is it doled out?

Q. In your book and on The New York Times podcast, The Daily, you delved into the role of feminist lawyer Lisa Bloom. Why did Bloom help Weinstein?
Twohey: She spent her career fashioning herself as one of the most prominent victims' rights advocates, and in 2016 she crossed to the other side to help Weinstein. She did that because she thought he had only engaged in inappropriate comments toward women and that she just wanted to help him apologize. We obtained these confidential records which show that she had much deeper knowledge of the serious allegations against him.
She has refused to have an in-depth conversation about that. It is worth noting that she had a business — before she went to work for him as a lawyer — and had done a deal in which the Weinstein Co. was going to make a book that she had written about Trayvon Martin into a movie.
This was also the case with David Boies, perhaps one of the most famous litigators in the country, who was helping Weinstein spin and conceal allegations of sexual misconduct for 15 years. He also was somebody who wanted to have his toe in the film industry.
Bloom has framed her work for Weinstein as a mistake. Boies, who actually granted extensive interviews for this book, has said he has no regrets about his handling of Weinstein and says that there was nothing unusual or wrong about the fact that they were intertwined on the film industry side of things. That's one of the things that we want readers to walk away pondering: How it is that people can end up doing this type of work for an alleged predator like Weinstein.
Q. Will there be a movie version of “She Said"?
Kantor: There are plans for a film adaptation; they're in the hands of Plan B, which is a company that has made a lot of films based on nonfiction material, like “Selma" and “Moonlight." What we're actually doing is continuing to report and investigate every day. The Weinstein trial is coming up in January, so we will be right here in the office of The New York Times, trying to unearth more information.

Glamping?

Texto completo: If you'd like a change from the daily grind, the constant sound of your cell phone and a unique experience, consider glamping. Emily Henning of Madison, owner of Upcountry Camp, supplies everything needed for glamping – short for glamorous camping – and does all of the work. Upcountry Camp sets up Sibley bell tents – they look like vintage campaign tents – and adds furnishings to them, so that they can turn girlfriend parties, neighborhood gatherings, milestone birthday parties, prom, graduation parties and almost any soiree into Instagram worthy occasions.
Depending upon the package selected, a tent can be furnished with a king- or queen-size bed or twin beds for sleeping or as a lounge area with a couch, two armchairs, coffee table, side tables, poufs, a chandelier, rugs, lanterns, fans, twinkle lights and multiple pillows.
Upcountry Camp also has 16 indoor teepees used mainly for children's birthday sleepovers and even for adult parties. Each tent comes with a memory foam mattress, soft sheets, pillow, lantern and twinkle lights, and party favors can be included as part of the deal.
Costs for Upcountry Camp experiences ranges from $210 for a three-person teepee party to $350-$800 for a glamping tent. For details, go to upcountrycamp.com
Glamping revenues are expected to grow in the next five years and reach an estimated $1 billion by 2024, according to The New York Times. The founding of the American Glamping Association is said to indicate the industry's journey to the mainstream.
Henning established her business in March 2017 with a single glamping tent, inspired by the glamping she and her family did from 2012-2016 when they lived in Nairobi, Kenya. Henning's husband, Ed, is a federal agent, and they moved to Africa because of his work.
"My husband and I loved camping, but it was so much work," she said. "Our experiences in Kenya changed our minds. When you go on an African safari, you sleep in a nice bed with nice sheets in a nice tent. Everything is done for you."
When Henning and her husband, daughter Josie and son Marcus returned to the United States, they lived in Atlanta, where she bought her first glamping tent, placed it in their backyard, took photos and put them on Instagram and Facebook. "Pretty soon we started booking gigs," she said.
In January 2017, the Hennings moved to Madison after deciding to relocate to a small, southern city similar to Roanoke, Virginia where they had once lived. Emily Henning grew up in a military family that lived in many places and earned a sociology/anthropology degree from the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and Ed Henning grew up in Roanoke, Virginia and earned a degree from Virginia Military Institute.
The move to Madison brought a quieter, easier lifestyle than what they had in Atlanta, Henning said, and has turned out to be good.
"My business has taken off in a way it never could have in Atlanta," she said. "It's easier to get to know people here than in Atlanta. We are super blessed with how well my business has been received here. It's been a fabulous thing to meet people and make friends."
Henning was treated for Stage I breast cancer in 2016 and that provided her another reason to pursue entrepreneurship. "It made me dig in deeper and think about how I want to live my life," she said.
She worked in nonprofit fundraising in Atlanta and used her knowledge from that to get the word out about her business. She has donated glamping packages or tent setups to events hosted by St. Andrew's Episcopal School, the Junior League of Jackson, Christ Covenant School, the Mississippi Museum of Art and the Mississippi Symphony League.
"It gives me a reason to go and set up a tent," she said. "People like to see the tents set up."
Henning has also set up a tent at Livingston Farmers Market and one at Fondren After Five in Jackson.
"The Beacon in Fondren has also been supportive with its Makers Market," she said. "What I have found is the entrepreneurial community is strong here."
On many weekends, Henning sets up for four or five glamping experiences. "That's busier than I ever expected to be," she said.
Lindsey and Blake Sloan of Brandon recently arranged for an Upcountry Camp teepee sleepover with a boho feel for their daughter, Addison, to celebrate her ninth birthday.
"The only thing she wanted for her birthday was to have a glamping party," Lindsey Sloan said. "She it on Instagram and was completely set on it. Emily (Henning) came in and set up everything up and took everything down. I ordered pizza and a birthday cake."
Lindsey Sloan said she is considering a party for herself. "I'm going to turn 35 in March, and I'm going to do a girl party with a big tent," she said.
Sonja and Ben Kerr of Ridgeland worked with Upcountry Camp on a sleepover party for their son, Jonah, who recently celebrated his ninth birthday.
"Emily set up the tent in our backyard," she said. "The tent itself is an attraction. She even had a trunk in the middle of the tent that had fans inside in case they needed them."
Sonja Kerr said she has worked with Upcountry Camp for three events, and Henning makes it easy.
"Emily's work ethic and rapport make you want to use her again," she said. "I feel like I've made a friend."
Henning believes glamping will continue to grow in popularity because people like ditching technology to spend time outdoors with family and friends.
"People are looking for unique experiences that they're going to remember that let them spend time with their friends and family," she said. "It's about experiences over things."

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders canceled upcoming appearances at campaign events after undergoing treatment for a blockage in one of his arteries, according to his campaign,
"During a campaign event yesterday evening, Sen. Sanders experienced some chest discomfort. Following medical evaluation and testing he was found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted," the Sanders campaign wrote in a statement emailed to news outlets on Wednesday.
Sanders, the independent senator for Vermont, is "conversing and in good spirits," according to the campaign statement from senior adviser Jeff Weaver.
Sanders felt chest discomfort while at a presidential campaign event Tuesday evening, according to the statement.
Age an issue for candidates Sanders, 78, is the oldest in a crowded field of Democratic presidential hopeful that includes two other candidates in their 70s, former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70.
Age, especially for Sanders and Biden, repeatedly have come up as an issue even before the two formally announced their candidacy.
Bonnie Goldstein, an opinion contributor to USA Today, wrote in a May 21 op-ed, "I have nothing against old people — I'm one of them. But maybe it's time to add a maximum age limit to our minimum age requirement for our presidents."
Goldstein's question was echoed in a Sept. 19 New York Times opinion piece, "Are Biden and Sanders Too Old to Be President?" by Spencer Bokat-Lindell.
Sanders, Biden and Warren have all pledged to release their medical records.
Sanders' health history Sanders released his medical records during his run for president in 2016. His doctor determined the senator to be "in overall very good health," laying out examples including:
A normal complete blood count.
No history of cardiovascular disease.
A normal colonoscopy.
Being up-to-date on recommended vaccinations.
At the time of the records being released, the senator was taking levothyroxine — used to treat hypothyroidism — daily and intermittently using indomethacin, which can be used to treat joint pain and associated with gout. The senator's doctor listed conditions and surgeries in Sanders' medical history, including:
Lumbar strain.
Hypothyroidism.
"Laryngitis secondary to esophageal reflux."
Gout.
Diverticulitis.
Surgeries for repair on "left and right side inguinal hernias by laparoscopic technique" as well as "a right true vocal cord cyst excision."
Sanders polling behind Warren, Biden The latest Real Clear Politics average of 2020 Democratic presidential nomination polls shows Sanders ranking third out of 19 candidates behind Biden and Warren.
Sanders is one of 12 candidates who qualified for the fourth Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 15 in Ohio.

Texto completo: Gov. Steve Bullock failed to make the list of 12 candidates who will appear in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential debate in Ohio, it was announced Wednesday, shutting him out once again to face political rivals on a national stage.
The Montana governor has qualified so far for one of the four debates. The debate later this month will be hosted by CNN and the New York Times at Otterbein University, a private, liberal arts campus of about 2,500 students in Westerville, Ohio.
Candidates had to receive at least 2% in four Democratic National Committee-approved polls and at least 130,000 unique donors to qualify, including 400 per state from at least 20 states by Oct. 1.
According to polls posted Wednesday on RealClearPolitics.com, Bullock garnered 0.3% in support for the presidential nomination.
The announcement of those invited was posted on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) website. DNC Chair Tom Perez spoke at the Lewis and Clark County Democrats annual candidate fundraiser Tuesday night in Helena.
Bullock did not attend the event. He and supporters have been critical of criteria the DNC uses to qualify those who can appear on the national debate stage. He said such rules have prohibited his voice, which he said would resonate with Democrats, from being heard. He often notes he was the only Democrat in the race who won reelection in 2016 in a state where Trump won.
Perez said the DNC has been "exceedingly transparent" from the beginning about the presidential debate criteria.
"It's hard to have a criteria of less than 1% to get on stage," he said.
Those qualifying for the debate are former Vice President Joe Biden, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Julián Castro and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.
Others participating are California Sen. Kamala Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California billionaire Tom Steyer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.

If House wants a real impeachment, it should vote for one commentary

Texto completo: The Founding Fathers were not clear about impeachment proceedings, but I think they'd sound like typical parents when it came to such a task:
"If you're going to do something, do it right."
In this case, if you think a criminal is running the country, shouldn't you do everything possible to stop the orange-haired menace?
You'd think that would get an unqualified "Yea" from Democrats. But a cat or something has got the tongues of some House members, including our own Stephanie Murphy and Val Demings.
Oh, they're definitely in favor of impeachment hearings. But they are not in favor of the House of Representatives voting whether to conduct the inquiry.
They say it's not necessary. Tradition says otherwise, and the courts might agree.
So why take the chance?
The obvious if unspoken reason is a lot of Americans still aren't convinced Donald Trump is a Russian spy or a Ukrainian conspirator. A roll-call vote authorizing an inquiry might endanger the re-election of representatives in swing districts.
So instead of the usual process, we've had months of Impeachment Lite. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, says that panel has been in "formal impeachment proceedings."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has played verbal dodgeball, refusing at times to even utter the I-word. All that semantic smog supposedly cleared last week with the news about Trump allegedly arm-twisting Ukraine's president into digging up dirt on Joe Biden.
Democrats see the whistleblower as a combination of Deep Throat and Moses, carrying the impeachment tablets that will finally deliver us from Trump.
"History is about to be written," Demings said on the House floor.
If you're too young to remember Bill Clinton's run-in with the Impeachment Police, here's how history usually works:
If lawmakers believe a civil officer has committed "Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors," they pass a resolution authorizing an inquiry. The Judiciary Committee investigates and votes whether to recommend articles of impeachment to the full House.
If a majority votes to impeach, the House sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial, where Mitch McConnell will promptly fold the document into a paper airplane and fly it toward the Potomac.
The whole thing's already a circus, but at least Pelosi has dubbed the proceedings an "official" impeachment, whatever that means. But she has not called for a floor vote authorizing an inquiry.
The Constitution doesn't dictate a precise way to handle impeachment. In the two modern-day presidential impeachments, the House voted on resolutions that laid out parameters of the inquiry and the powers the Judiciary Committee would have.
Why not do that now?
"No vote is necessary for the House Judiciary Committee to consider or file articles of impeachment," Demings said in a statement.
That's true, but a floor vote could bolster investigators' ability to enforce subpoenas and compel testimony.
Democrats say they already have those powers, and many constitutional scholars agree. But House parliamentarians and judges lean toward tradition when interpreting rules. "They can say they are (fully empowered), but what will a judge think, given the precedent in the past?" Michael Conway told the New York Times.
He was a Judiciary Committee lawyer during Richard Nixon's impeachment. A federal court judge has already rejected one Nadler request. It's unclear a House authorization vote would have helped, but it sure couldn't have hurt.
I polled Central Florida's representatives this week to see if the whistleblower story had changed their stance on a House vote.
Daniel Webster, the lone local Republican, is for a vote and getting people on the record. Daren Soto says a vote is not necessary to fully empower the investigation. He's in favor of one, however, because it would reduce potential roadblocks.
"We should lessen the ambiguity with a vote," he said in a statement.
Demings said Trump's Ukrainian phone call was corrupt, illegal and intolerable. But she doesn't want a vote.
Murphy supports the investigation but said a vote is not necessary. She represents a toss-up district and at times has been a refreshingly moderate voice amid Washington's partisan yammering.
I can't say her reticence is simply a political calculation. The truth is there is no way to calculate your way out of this one.
There might not be a vote to authorize an inquiry, but you can bet Nadler will eventually recommend articles of impeachment. Sooner or later, every House member is going to have to stand up and be counted.
They might as well do it sooner and put investigators on the firmest legal ground possible.
After all, if you are about to write history, shouldn't you do it right?

Man sentenced for Globe threats

Texto completo: For more than a week in 2018, Robert D. Chain repeatedly called the Boston Globe news desk from his Encino, Calif., home and threatened to shoot and kill employees of the newspaper.
“We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs," Chain said in one call. “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
On Wednesday, a remorseful Chain appeared in US District Court in Boston and said he never intended to hurt anyone.
“Making those phone calls was the worst decision I've ever made. I really can't believe I said those things," Chain told Judge William Young. “I just hope that those . . . people can forgive me. I truly wish them nothing but the best."
Young sentenced Chain to four months in prison, a punishment he said was necessary to reflect the gravity of making violent threats against a pillar of US democracy.
The press can be shallow and messy, at times coddling of the rich and famous, Young told Chain.
“But they're free," he said. “In today's world, where the truth is a precious commodity, done right, journalism is perhaps our last best hope of having that truth upon which this democracy depends. You attacked that."
Chain, 69, was also ordered to pay a $3,500 fine and more than $16,500 in restitution to the Globe. Federal prosecutors had sought a 10-month prison sentence for Chain.
Chain's calls began on Aug. 10, 2018, at the time the Globe's editorial page was calling on other newspapers to sign onto an editorial protesting President Trump's attacks on journalists as the “enemy of the people." In June of that year, a gunman opened fire in the newsroom of the Annapolis Gazette, killing five employees.
Chain's threats were especially chilling in light of those circumstances, said Andres Picon, a Boston University senior who answered some of Chain's calls.
“The days between Mr. Chain's first call to the Globe newsroom and his subsequent arrest were undoubtedly some of the most frightening in my life," Picon told Young in a victim impact statement. “I had no idea whether Mr. Chain's threats were credible. In a time when members of the media are constantly being attacked for doing their jobs . . . it seemed anything was possible."
Chain had also threatened reporters at the New York Times, leaving messages filled with racial slurs and threats.
The FBI traced the calls to Chain's home. On Aug. 30, 2018, 12 days after the first calls were made to the Globe, agents searched Chain's house and found 19 firearms, including a shotgun and semiautomatic handguns, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
Assistant US Attorney George Varghese said Chain carried out a “campaign of terror against the Boston Globe newsroom." On one call, he threatened to shoot Globe employees in the head later that day.
“That threat alone caused panic in the newsroom," Varghese said.
In May, Chain pleaded guilty to seven counts of using interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person.
Chain's lawyers attributed his actions in large part to serious mental health problems that began in 2012 when his 25-year-old son committed suicide. Chain sank into a deep depression, withdrew from his friends and neighbors, and began watching cable news, said William Weinreb, one of Chain's lawyers.
After his arrest, Chain began attending anger management classes, stopped smoking marijuana, and began seeing a therapist four times a week, Weinreb said. He asked that Chain be sentenced to six months home detention and two years of supervised release.
Chain declined to comment to reporters after the hearing. His wife, son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, a toddler, attended the sentencing.

Texto completo: My dental hygienist and I have a longstanding, unspoken agreement: I won't get any cavities, and she'll pretend to believe me when I tell her I floss every day. Truth be told, it's more like once a week.
Despite reports that flossing may be "overrated," the American Dental Association (A.D.A.) and the US Department of Health and Human Services still recommend flossing every day. The research is limited, and flossing is not a cure-all, but it is still one of the few things people can do -- along with brushing, drinking fluoridated water, rinsing with mouthwash, eating well, and going to the dentist regularly -- to stand a chance against severe, long-term oral-health problems.
Thankfully, in addition to string floss, you can find other interdental cleaners -- things designed to clean between teeth -- that are safe and effective. The best way to know whether an interdental cleaner is right for you is by asking your dentist, said Dr. Michele Neuburger, a dental officer in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Oral Health.
"It's really important that you choose something that works for you, so you can feel comfortable using it on a daily basis," Dr. Neuburger said. "Your dentist will be able to give you a personalized recommendation based on the spacing between your teeth, the health of your gums, or any dental work you might have like braces or a bridge."
If you have any kind of manual dexterity difficulties, or developmental disabilities that make it hard to floss, it's especially important to talk things through with your dentist.
What to try if you hate string floss
Whatever you can do to consistently disrupt the plaque between your teeth and stimulate your gums is better than nothing. If you fear floss, some alternatives have been shown to "demonstrate safety and efficacy" in clinical or lab data submitted to the A.D.A. Dr. Ruchi Sahota, a spokesperson for the organization, said she always tells her patients to look for the A.D.A. Seal of Acceptance when shopping for interdental cleaners, and Dr. Neuburger recommends making sure dental items are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (F.D.A.) in addition to having the A.D.A. Seal of Acceptance.
Here are some types to try:
Oral irrigators
These electronic devices shoot either a thin stream of water (water flossers) or a thin stream of air punctuated by bursts of tiny water droplets (air flossers) between teeth to remove plaque. Of these, Wirecutter recommends the Waterpik Aquarius.
A 2019 Cochrane Review examining 35 randomized controlled trials found that oral irrigation has been shown to reduce gingivitis symptoms (bleeding gums) in the short term but found no evidence for overall plaque reduction.
Interdental brushes
These small, textured brushes made for cleaning between teeth can be easier to hold and maneuver than floss. The Cochrane Review found that such tools can reduce gingivitis symptoms and plaque in the short term, and a 2015 review of nearly 400 studies, published in the Journal of Clinical Periodontology, found "moderate" evidence that interdental brushes reduce plaque and gingivitis symptoms. People with tightly spaced teeth may have trouble using them, and according to the A.D.A., people with electronic implants in their mouths should avoid interdental brushes with an exposed metal wire.
Toothpicks
Like interdental brushes, some toothpicks (usually made of wood, rubber, or plastic) may be easier to hold than a strand of floss. The toothpicks you might pick up at your local diner are probably not A.D.A. approved, but you can find wooden "plaque removers" with the A.D.A. Seal of Acceptance. The Cochrane Review found that wooden "cleaning sticks" can help reduce gingivitis but not plaque, whereas those made of synthetic materials can help reduce plaque but not gingivitis symptoms.
Floss picks
A floss pick is a disposable tool with a toothpick on one end and a bit of floss held taut on the other. A 2007 study published in the Journal of Clinical Dentistry found that floss picks are "at least as good as" regular dental floss when it comes to removing plaque. Reusable floss holders are also available -- some are just a plastic handle that you can string floss onto, and others have disposable floss cartridges that you have to buy separately -- but none of these tools have the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and a 2011 study published in Clinical Oral Investigations found that many reusable floss holders are difficult to maneuver.
Tape floss
According to the A.D.A., your flossing technique and frequency are more important than what your floss is made out of -- nylon, plastic, waxed, or unwaxed. Some people find that a wide, flat, tape-style floss (rather than a strand of fibers woven together) is more comfortable and easier to slide between tightly spaced teeth.
Some things just can't take the place of flossing, according to the A.D.A. Charcoal, for example, wears away at tooth enamel. Tongue scrapers don't work. Oil pulling doesn't improve oral health -- and, according to the British Dental Journal, harmful side effects such as upset stomach have been reported.
Do you have to floss if you use an electric toothbrush?
Regardless of what kind of toothbrush you use -- and how good your brushing technique is -- it can't replace flossing. A 2014 Cochrane Review found that electric toothbrushes are generally more effective than manual brushes at reducing plaque and gingivitis symptoms. But even the best toothbrushes clean only the top, front, and back surfaces of the teeth. Unless you use an interdental cleaner, you're leaving the side surfaces exposed.
"Cleaning in between our teeth is one of the best things we can do to prevent cavities, bleeding, gum disease, and infection," Dr. Sahota said.
Whatever you choose, make it a habit
For patients who struggle with cleaning between their teeth, Dr. Sahota's main piece of advice is to power through for 10 days in a row.
"On that 11th day," she said, "I guarantee it will be comfortable, or at least it won't be quite as uncomfortable." And by that time, "it won't make you bleed."
After the initial discomfort subsides, said Dr. Sahota, people start to feel a difference -- their teeth feel cleaner and less sensitive. Flossing becomes a habit, not a chore. It gets to a point where they can't imagine not flossing every day.
"It would be like washing your hands and not cleaning in between your fingers," she said.
If it hurts to floss, or if it remains uncomfortable after two weeks, you could have an underlying problem, for which you should see a dentist. Or maybe you're just flossing too hard.
"You shouldn't be flossing so aggressively that it traumatizes or damages that gum tissue," said Dr. Sahota. "You have to be gentle. Don't be so gentle that you fail to disrupt the plaque, of course, but there's a happy medium."

Texto completo: The president made a series of inaccurate claims as he sought to challenge the credibility of the investigation by House Democrats into his dealings with Ukraine.
President Trump used two events at the White House with the president of Finland on Wednesday to challenge Democrats as they pressed ahead with their investigation into whether Mr. Trump had abused the power of his office in seeking political dirt from Ukraine.
Here's a fact check of his remarks.
"And then Schiff went up and he got, as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn't take place. He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown. But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is when he looked at the sheet -- which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this -- exact, word for word, he said, 'Wow, he didn't do anything wrong.' So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said."
False.
For days, Mr. Trump has criticized statements made by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, during a congressional hearing last week about the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That call is part of a whistle-blower complaint that led Democrats to begin an impeachment inquiry.
The president, who often misquotes others, has repeatedly accused Mr. Schiff of "treason" and committing a "crime" for the way he presented the call. He escalated those attacks by claiming, without evidence, that Mr. Schiff had decided to fabricate the conversation after realizing that Mr. Trump "didn't do anything wrong."
Mr. Schiff did not claim to be reciting from a reconstructed transcript of the call and said he was conferring "the essence" of the conversation. But he did speak in first person, leaving an impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump. Later in the hearing, Mr. Schiff said that his "summary of the president's call was meant to be at least part in parody."
While Mr. Schiff's account veered from the transcript in chronology and details at points, and seemed intended to draw attention to the implication that Mr. Trump was demanding something from Ukraine in return for the assistance the United States had provided the country, it generally tracked with the transcript's version of what Mr. Trump said on the call.
Mr. Trump is also wrong that the transcript of the phone call released by the White House last week was "word for word." In fact, a footnote in the document specifically cautions that it is "not a verbatim transcript."
According to Mr. Schiff, Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky: "We've been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have, but you know what, I don't see much reciprocity here. I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you, though."
The transcript quotes Mr. Trump as saying that "the United States has been very very good to Ukraine," adding, that "I wouldn't say that it's reciprocal necessarily," that the United States had done "much more than the European countries" and that "I would like you to do us a favor."
And in criticizing Mr. Schiff for an erroneous re-enactment of the call, Mr. Trump in turn assumed Mr. Schiff's voice and attributed remarks to the California lawmaker that he did not make. Mr. Schiff never said Mr. Trump did nothing wrong, but rather described Mr. Trump's conduct as a "classic organized crime shakedown" and "a real betrayal" of national security.
"He knew long before, and he helped write it, too."
False.
Mr. Trump was referring to a New York Times report about how Mr. Schiff learned about the whistle-blower's concerns days before the complaint was filed. The Times did not report that Mr. Schiff "helped write it." A spokesman for Mr. Schiff said he had seen no part of the complaint before it was filed.
"Well, the whistle-blower was very inaccurate."

"The whistle-blower said terrible things about the call, but he then -- I then found out he was secondhand and thirdhand. In other words, he didn't know what was on the call."
False.
The whistle-blower did, in fact, have firsthand information, according to a statement from the Office of the Inspector General of the intelligence agencies.
"The whistle-blower stated on the form that he or she possessed both firsthand and other information," the office said on Monday. It also noted that the inspector general "did not find that the complainant could 'provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions."'
In the complaint, the whistle-blower also wrote that "I was not a direct witness to most of the events described" -- suggesting he or she did witness at least one of the events described.
And contrary to Mr. Trump's claim, the whistle-blower's account of the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky is quite accurate, based on the reconstructed transcript released by the White House.
The complaint reports that White House officials said Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden; to assist in "uncovering that allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election originated in Ukraine"; and to meet with Attorney General William P. Barr and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.
All of this is supported by the transcript.
"I heard Rick Scott today say: 'That was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?"'
This is exaggerated.
"Perfect" is how Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly described his phone call with Mr. Zelensky, but The Times was unable to find any instance of Senator Scott, Republican of Florida, using the same word.
"We've all seen it. We saw the transcript, we saw what the whistle-blower put out. I don't see what they're talking about," Mr. Scott said Wednesday on Fox News. "I still don't see what the crime is. I keep saying show me what the crime is. And no one ever says that. They say, 'Well he shouldn't have done it.' All of us would do things differently than other people would do it. If we impeach somebody, there ought to be something they did wrong."
In a Sept. 25 appearance on Fox News, Mr. Scott was asked whether he was bothered by Mr. Trump asking Mr. Zelensky to insert Ukraine into another presidential election.
"Does everybody, including President Trump, do they ask questions that I don't ask? Do they -- do they focus on things that I don't focus on?" Mr. Scott responded. "But that's not the issue here. The issue is, is this an impeachable offense? And should we go back and do the work that American citizens sent us to D.C. to do, pass a budget, deal with prescription drug prices?"
Mr. Trump also repeated several claims that The Times had previously fact-checked: lamenting that the United States is the only country that gives "big money to Ukraine" (other countries contribute billions of dollars in assistance), accusing Democratic senators of threatening Ukraine in a letter (there was no overt threat), claiming credit for the Veterans Choice program (which was created in 2014), asserting that the United States "never had wins with other presidents" from the World Trade Organization (it has won 85.7 percent of cases it initiated since 1995), and exaggerating the cost of the Mueller investigation as $ 42 million (it was $ 32 million).

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- There are several reasons Afghan officials are struggling to determine how people voted in the presidential election last week -- possible fraud, misplaced biometric data and the country's vast geography. But there is one factor that has complicated the effort more than any other: the Taliban's tactic of destroying cellphone towers.
Afghanistan's growing cellular network has long been considered a benchmark for the country's modernization and growth. But the destruction of the towers prevented voting officials from communicating with election workers in the country, while instigating fear and intimidation in the affected areas.
The Taliban have sought support in the rural hamlets and towns that harbor militants, even as they fight the government in Kabul. The cellphone tower strategy augments the group's more conventional, and deadly, forms of insurgency. There were scores of attacks on election targets on Saturday that killed police officers and wounded civilians.
While officials praised the Afghan security forces for their performance in defending against widespread smaller attacks, the Taliban still managed to create a cloud over the elections. Four days after the vote, officials were still struggling to determine how many people had turned out, although the initial figures from the election commission put the number around two and a half million, a historic low.
As recently as last month, the elections were not even certain to happen, with all the attention focused on negotiations between the Taliban and the United States that were nearing a deal for an American withdrawal. If the two sides had finalized an agreement, the election was likely to have been postponed. But President Trump abruptly canceled the talks.
On Wednesday, Zalmay Khalizad, the United States special envoy who had been conducting those talks, arrived for meetings with officials in Pakistan, where Taliban insurgents have sanctuaries. His visit overlapped with Taliban negotiators, based in Qatar, who also were visiting Pakistan. But it remained unclear whether Mr. Khalilzad would meet them.
The election results are not expected for weeks, and a runoff is likely, although the uncertainty has not prevented each campaign of the two main contenders, President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, from claiming its candidate is ahead.
In the northeastern province of Takhar, Taliban commanders warned cellphone companies that if they did not deactivate their towers, the militant group would destroy them.
"We have the Taliban letter with us: The order was given by Mawlawi Haibatullah, the Taliban leader," said Ghafoor Talash, the head of the telecommunications and information technology department in Takhar. "The reason for the order was to violate the election."
After Mr. Talash contacted his counterparts in Kabul, he was instructed to make sure the towers stayed on at least for Election Day, and the Taliban followed through on their threat. Several towers were destroyed, he said, along with two other main towers in Baghlan and Kunduz provinces. Some towers, Mr. Talash said, cost $ 200,000 a piece, while some other, larger sites can cost as much as $ 1 million.
Often, as was the case on Saturday, Afghanistan's telecom companies are caught in the middle: threats from the Taliban to shut off their towers, or have their license revoked by the government if they adhere to the militants' demands.
On Tuesday, after days of fighting -- along with an American airstrike that accidentally struck a pro-government militia outpost, killing seven people -- the deactivated towers were turned back on, and repair teams set out to fix the burned infrastructure, Mr. Talash said.
There are more than 6,000 cell towers spread across the country, according to Afghan government statistics, providing coverage to roughly 90 percent of the population, and problems were reported beyond Takhar.
Service was disabled or limited in several other provinces, and service was intermittent even in Kandahar City, one of the country's largest urban centers, because of Taliban threats on Saturday. In Farah, a southwestern province heavily contested by the Taliban, some cell towers remain offline.
"The dysfunctional communication network created lots of problems, especially during polling day," said Muhibullah Muhib, a police spokesman in Farah Province. "You are not aware of the situation, and you cannot be aware of incidents and the turnout."
The election took place after several fraud scandals cast doubt on the integrity of the election, even after officials said votes that had been verified through a biometric system would be counted. Many voters complained that they could not find their names at the polling stations they had signed up to vote.
As officials tried to restore the cellphone network, the country was also taking stock of the violence that shook the country on Saturday. Taliban fighters killed more than 30 people in Takhar, including women and children, over the weekend, according to Ahmad Monir Azizi, the acting director of Takhar Provincial Hospital, in what appeared to have been a concerted push to overrun another provincial center.
The Interior Ministry said there had been more than 60 attacks on election targets on Saturday, leaving three police officers dead and 37 civilians and two Afghan army soldiers wounded.
Privately, officials acknowledged that the number of attacks were much higher, possibly more that 200. A New York Times tally put the number of dead at roughly 40 and the wounded at more than 170.
Fahim Abed and Mujib Mashal contributed reporting from Kabul and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.

MINNEAPOLIS MUSEUM TURNS ITS EYES TO TEXAS

Texto completo: The Minneapolis Institute of Art named an art expert with an entrepreneurial past Tuesday as its next director and president: Katherine Luber, of the San Antonio Museum of Art.
A fifth-generation Texan, Luber, 58, will become the 12th person -- and second woman -- to run Mia, one of the country's leading museums.
"For me it's an opportunity to fly, in a way, and stretch my wings as leader," Luber said in an interview. "The breadth of the collections, the importance of the museum to the community … This is an extraordinary opportunity."
Luber, who has led the San Antonio institution for eight years, possesses not only a Ph.D. in art history but also an MBA and experience launching an organic spice company.
"She brings both the business world and the art curatorial world together in one person, which when we looked at our pool of candidates is pretty unusual," said David Wilson, chairman of Mia's board of trustees, which unanimously approved the pick at its meeting Tuesday.
That business-world know-how will come in handy as Mia moves forward with a campus revamp -- outlined in a master plan adopted late last year -- to make more room for artworks and people. Wilson noted "daunting challenges," including "crumbling parking infrastructure and a huge lack of art storage."
"She will be able to not only look at this master plan from the perspective of how is this going to serve our art, our community, our patrons," he said, "but also, how can we make it work financially."
Luber, who starts in January, succeeds Kaywin Feldman, who left Minneapolis' encyclopedic museum in March for a high-profile post as the first female director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
Luber will oversee a staff of 250, more than 90,000 artworks and a $35 million annual budget -- much larger than the San Antonio Museum of Art, a younger institution that, in 2018, had an $11 million budget, 82 full-time employees and 30,000 works. San Antonio's 132,000 visitors compares with 700,000-plus at Mia, which was founded in 1883.
"We had good directors, but we were at the point where we were looking for someone to take us to the next level," said the San Antonio museum's former board chairwoman, Karen Hixon, who hired Luber back in 2011.
Since then, the museum's collection and endowment have swelled. Luber created an aggressive master plan to improve the campus, set in a historic brewery on San Antonio's River Walk, and organized ambitious exhibitions, including an homage to Spain last year that included masterpieces seen in the United States for the first time. That show earned a feature in the New York Times.
"She really put us on the map," Hixon said.
That exhibition, "Spain: 500 Years of Spanish Painting From the Museums of Madrid," was challenging logistically and otherwise, Luber said in an interview Tuesday evening at the Hewing Hotel in Minneapolis. It cost more than $2 million, she said, making it "one of the biggest and most expensive shows the museum had ever done. (After Bank of America came on board, others followed.)
She found it tough "getting anyone in San Antonio to think it was possible." (She convinced them.) Then she had to persuade the Prado, one of the world's renowned museums, to take San Antonio seriously. (Once it came on board, other Madrid institutions did, too.)
"She is a curator's director in the sense that she loves art -- all art of all periods, and has a great knowledge of art because she has been a curator," said William Keyse Rudolph, the San Antonio museum's chief curator. The two have known each other for 25 years, since they worked at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
They co-curated the Spain exhibit, which was "a lot of moving parts on an incredibly short runway," he said. "We were Southwest Airlines -- it was like a 20-minute turnaround."
Luber encouraged her team to dream big, Rudolph said, and "let our little light shine."
She has history with encyclopedic museums, including the Met in New York and the Philadelphia Museum, where she was a curator for nearly a decade, specializing in Northern Renaissance and Baroque paintings.
Luber praised her predecessor at Mia, noting that Feldman's influence extended well beyond Minneapolis: "She pushed the museum field forward."
During her 11-year tenure, Feldman added a contemporary art department and made the museum a national model for technology.
She also got national attention by championing exhibitions that reflected the Twin Cities' diverse communities. In 2017, the museum hosted its first exhibition of contemporary Somali art. The following year, it showed works created in response to the police shooting death of Philando Castile. This summer, it hosted a nationally noted exhibition highlighting female American Indian artists, the first show of its kind.
Luber pledged to continue that work, making the museum more accessible and inclusive. In San Antonio, she rethought the museum's work with children, connecting with public schools and rallying private funders to bring in at-risk and underserved Latino children for visits and programs.
That effort was inspired by a conversation with a City Council member who told her families in his district couldn't afford to travel. "But they can come to the museum and see the world," she said, her eyes welling with tears at the memory. "My heart broke in half."
Luber will receive an initial annual salary of $500,000. By comparison, Feldman earned about $613,000 in the fiscal year that ended in June 2018, the most recent financial report available.
Born in Fort Worth, Luber, 58, earned a bachelor's degree from Yale University, a master's from the University of Texas at Austin and a Ph.D. in art history from Bryn Mawr. For her dissertation, she delved into paintings by Albrecht Dürer, the 16th-century German artist.
But she also holds an MBA from Johns Hopkins University. Luber started those studies as "a girl who hadn't taken math since junior year of high school," she said, and graduated as a lover of spreadsheets.
A class project turned into a veritable business: She launched, led and, after five years, sold the Seasoned Palate, a company specializing in organic spices sold in smaller, stay-fresh portions.
"The reason I went to get my MBA, honestly, is that when I was in the museum there was always a bit of disconnect between the business side and the curatorial side," she told the San Antonio Express-News in 2011. "I'm a firm supporter of all things curatorial because I think that's the heart and soul of a museum, but it is also a business, and there has to be a certain understanding of the way it has to operate."
She said her husband jokes that if the 2008 recession hadn't occurred, Luber might never have returned to museums.
That's not true, she said. "I missed it a lot." And those lessons have helped inside the galleries. "It really enriched my ability to look at problems in a different way than someone who's only worked in a museum."

Jussie Smollett: I’m nothing like that little girl who actually apologized for fabricating a hate crime hoax

Texto completo: Noted hate crime hoaxer Jussie Smollett says it is unfair to compare him to the Virginia sixth-grader who confessed this week to fabricating a story about white classmates forcibly cutting her dreadlocks.
He is right. 12-year-old Amari Allen has at least apologized for lying. She is no Jussie.
Allen’s false tale of racial discrimination gained national attention last week after newsrooms seized on the fact that Second Lady Karen Pence teaches part-time at the girl’s school, Immanuel Christian in Springfield, Va. Reporters saw this as the perfect hook to make a local story about alleged discrimination into a much larger story about the Trump administration. This led the New York Times to interview the 12-year-old girl and repeat her allegations verbatim without actually scrutinizing them.
The story, of course, fell apart almost immediately once it was looked into.
This is where Smollett resurfaces. Shortly after newsrooms reported Allen's story was a hoax, the Instagram account “theshaderoom” posted a picture of the student with the headline, “Virginia teen who claimed white students cut her dreadlocks reportedly admits to fabricating the story.”
Another Instagram user, Derrick Jackson, wrote that “Jussie really is a trendsetter.” But Smollet took exception and chimed in.
“With all due respect brother,” the actor responded, “y’all can clown me all you want, but my story has actually never changed and I haven’t lied about a thing. Y’all can continue to be misinformed, internalized sheep, who believe what actual proven liars feed you or you can read the actual docs.”

Smollett concluded. “Either way, Imma be alright. I know me and what happened. You don’t. So carry on. All love.”
For the record, Smollett staged a hate crime against himself in conjunction with two acquaintances. He then went to police with a story about two white men in MAGA hats attacking him in subzero weather in Chicago at roughly 2:00 a.m. These Chicago rednecks supposedly recognized him as he was walking home, carrying a Subway sandwich.
The attackers turned out to be two Nigerian actors with ties to Smolett's television show. Prosecutors say that there is an electronic trail of evidence showing Smolett planned the "hate crime" with them in advance.
Smollett is right to take exception to the comparisons between himself and Amari Allen. Her story was marginally more believable and she probably only did what she did because of the bad example of adults who should have known better.
Also, she at least had the moral courage to admit she lied.

Texto completo: Waterville Mayor Nick Isgro found himself embroiled in a bitter confrontation with area residents over his proclamation recognizing Columbus Day, but was not without his defenders.
The Waterville Morning Sentinel reports that the Republican mayor read his one-page proclamation when Tuesday night's City Council meeting started, drawing a mixture of criticism and support from the audience. Exchanges became heated at times, and Isgro at one point threatened to have the police chief eject people from the meeting if they spoke without being recognized, according to the newspaper.
The proclamation, quoting President Benjamin Harrison, lauds Christopher Columbus as a "pioneer of progress and enlightenment," whose arrival in the Americas in 1492 prompted the migration of millions of Europeans, who "brought their art, music, science, medicine, philosophy and religious principles to America."
"The accomplishments of Columbus through his courage and willingness to take unknown risks in exchange for discovery, knowledge, and greatness has trickled down through each generation of Americans, from the early pioneer settlers to the exploration of the vast universe beyond our atmosphere," the proclamation reads.
[iframe url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6442468-Waterville-Columbus-Day-Proclamation.html" responsive=true height="550" width="400"]
It further states that Italian-Americans as an ethnic group have made contributions to American business, civic life and culture of "unquestionable value."
In an early exchange, Isgro said Columbus Day is a federal holiday, according to the Sentinel, and its recognition came in the wake of an 1891 lynching of 11 Italian-Americans in New Orleans. Then-President Harrison called the crime "deplorable," according to The New York Times, and in 1892, he issued a proclamation declaring Oct. 21 Columbus Day.
"It was actually a pro-immigrant holiday," the Sentinel quoted Isgro as saying.
But audience member Meg Charest called the holiday a "malevolent erasure of a long and violent history of genocide and abuse of indigenous people," and asked that Isgro apologize and declare Oct. 14 Indigenous Peoples Day, according to the Sentinel.
A member of the city's planning board, Cathy Weeks, defended Isgro, saying recognizing Columbus Day wasn't an issue until earlier this year when Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, signed into law a bill that dropped the state's recognition of the federal holiday in favor of Indigenous Peoples Day, a move Weeks likened to the Islamic State group's destruction of cultural artifacts in Syria.
Maine is among a growing number of states -- including New Mexico and Vermont -- that now recognize Indigenous Peoples Day instead of Columbus Day. That followed a movement among Maine communities, starting in Belfast in 2015, to recognize Indigenous Peoples Day as activists worked to shift perception of Columbus, whose arrival in the Americas ushered in centuries of subjugation, enslavement and genocide against the continent's original inhabitants.
Bangor, Brunswick, Gouldsboro, Orono and Portland were among the other towns and cities that recognized Indigenous Peoples Day prior to April, when Mills dropped the state's recognition of Columbus Day.
Columbus' first trans-Atlantic voyage in 1492 was sponsored by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Columbus would make three additional ocean crossings to the Americas, in 1493, 1498 and 1502. Columbus served for a time as governor of Hispaniola, but that came to an end in 1500 when he was led back to Spain in chains after complaints from colonists about mismanagement and brutality prompted the visit of a royal commissioner. He was freed on order of Ferdinand and Isabella, who later financed his 1502 expedition.

Airbnb looking to forgo a traditional IPO; Company may opt for direct listing, in which market sets the price.

Texto completo: Airbnb Inc.'s long-awaited Wall Street debut is officially earmarked for 2020, but the home-share start-up is charting an unconventional path to the public markets.
San Francisco-based Airbnb is laying the groundwork for a direct listing rather than an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing private information. Airbnb declined to comment.
Technology start-ups usually choose a traditional IPO to tap into the public markets. Some of the new generation of tech firms have spent years raising private funds and don't necessarily need money from an IPO to expand their business but are looking for a way to let employees and investors cash out. A direct listing allows companies to lower the millions of dollars they typically pay to investment banks in underwriting fees, because they don't issue any new shares and don't raise any new capital. Instead, they let the market choose the price. Slack Technologies Inc. and Spotify Technology have taken the direct listing route.

An IPO would also force Airbnb to open its books to investors. WeWork parent We Co., which was supposed to have an IPO this fall, had to withdraw its plans after some investors took a look and were highly critical. Amid the ensuing scrutiny, the CEO resigned, and financial advisors said WeWork's potential valuation probably would be only about a quarter of its earlier $47 billion.
On Tuesday, hundreds of venture capitalists and executives from private companies met in Silicon Valley to discuss the benefits of direct listings. The event was sponsored by 12 venture capital firms and included Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital, the biggest venture capital backer of Airbnb, Benchmark's Bill Gurley and Spotify Chief Financial Officer Barry McCarthy.
With a private valuation of $31 billion, Airbnb is expected to be one of the most high-profile companies to go public next year.
Airbnb executives have been talking about an IPO since at least 2018, and the extended timeline has caused tension inside the company. Last summer, a handful of former employees sent a letter to Airbnb's founders pleading for a public offering so they could sell their stock options -- some of which start expiring in November 2020, according to the New York Times. Earlier last year, Chief Financial Officer Laurence Tosi left the company after butting heads with Chief Executive Brian Chesky, in part over the timing of the IPO.
Last month, Airbnb officially announced it would go public in 2020 in a one-sentence news release. The company didn't give any additional details on the timeline or whether it intended to file for an IPO or take the direct listing route. So far this year, Airbnb's fellow tech unicorns that have gone public have received a chilly reception. Uber Technologies Inc. is trading at 30% below its IPO price, Lyft Inc. is down more than 40% and Slack is down almost 8%.
Unlike these unprofitable companies, Airbnb has a stronger financial position. In the last quarter, it pulled in more than $1 billion in revenue, and the company said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were positive in both 2017 and 2018.
Uber's former political advisor Bradley Tusk says a direct listing would be more beneficial for Airbnb, which is now an 11-year-old company.
"What we've seen with Uber, Lyft and the other big ones is that when you're private for so, so long, you don't get any honeymoon by the time you go public," Tusk said. "Given the struggles so many tech companies have had in the past year and a half, it's not shocking they might want to try something different."
As Airbnb prepares for its entrance into the public markets, one of its major hurdles is solving outstanding regulatory issues in some of its biggest markets, like Paris and New York City, where its business model of short-term home rentals has been at odds with the city for a decade. Investors want Airbnb to resolve its regulatory battles before going public since failure to do so could cast doubt on the company's valuation.
David Hsu, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, says that bypassing the roadshow that goes hand in hand with a traditional IPO means Airbnb "wouldn't have to retell the story and expose wounds that are already there."
The company could, however, experience more price volatility in its stock because it hasn't been as well vetted and wouldn't have the support of an underwriter. "The direct listing is super new, but it may well be appropriate for Airbnb," Hsu said. "They are already a well-known business model because lots of people have stayed in an Airbnb, so this theoretical danger of volatility in the price may not be that significant."
Dennis Schaal, executive editor of online travel analysis site Skift, said he would bet on Airbnb doing a direct listing. "What's clear from its history is that Airbnb executives like to do things their own way," Schaal wrote in a recent column. "If the company can avoid the well-worn and costly initial public offering route that many of its peers have slogged through, and go for a direct listing instead, then that would be another jab at mainstream practices, make employees happy, and would fit in nicely with the Airbnb start-up narrative and culture."

Judge Pressures Prosecutors to Decide Whether to Pursue a Case Against McCabe

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has come under increasing pressure in its investigation of the former deputy F.B.I. director Andrew G. McCabe, as a federal judge threatened to release internal department records unless prosecutors decide whether to move forward with or abandon the politically charged case.
Judge Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over a lawsuit over F.B.I. documents related to Mr. McCabe's firing last year, said at a hearing on Monday that he would soon begin releasing them. The Justice Department has argued that the materials should stay confidential while prosecutors investigate Mr. McCabe over whether he lied to internal investigators about dealings with the news media.
"You all have got to cut and make your decision," Mr. Walton said, according to a transcript. "It's not a hard decision, and I think it needs to be made. If it's not made, I'm going to start ordering the release of information because I think our society, our public, does have a right to know what's going on."
Mr. McCabe, long a target of President Trump's, was the subject of a scathing report by the Justice Department inspector general's office that faulted him for violating media policy and repeatedly misleading its investigators. They were asking about an October 2016 Wall Street Journal article about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Mr. McCabe, working through the F.B.I. press office, had authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak to a reporter to rebut allegations that he had slowed the inquiry.
Mr. McCabe was fired in March 2018, hours before retirement benefits would have kicked in, and the inspector general referred his findings to federal prosecutors in Washington a month later.
Judge Walton's stern warning came as prosecutors grappled with whether to bring charges in what is a seemingly straightforward case with a limited set of facts and witnesses that has been under investigation for 19 months.
"This matter is a high-profile matter," Judge Walton said. He added that as long as prosecutors hold off on deciding how to proceed, they "undermine the credibility not only of the Justice Department because it's not making these hard decisions, but also the court."
Mr. McCabe's lawyers have argued that the case is weak and that he is being singled out because of the president's disdain for him. Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. McCabe, potentially complicating any prosecution. Mr. McCabe has said the president targeted him to undermine his standing as a witness to whether he obstructed justice in the Russia inquiry.
In August, Mr. McCabe's lawyers met with Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, to make a last-ditch appeal for prosecutors to drop the case. Their pleas were rebuffed, and an indictment appeared imminent. But the grand jury hearing the case reconvened last month after weeks without meeting but did not indict Mr. McCabe, raising questions about whether prosecutors delayed a vote by jurors to avoid a rare and embarrassing setback of their declining to hand up an indictment.
Other setbacks have emerged for the government. One prosecutor on the case left the Justice Department and has said it lacked merit while another left on what seemed like the eve of a possible indictment.
A key witness in the case -- Lisa Page, the former F.B.I. lawyer whom Mr. McCabe authorized to speak to the Wall Street Journal reporter -- also told the grand jury that he was not motivated to lie about the episode because he was authorized to speak with reporters and thus did not violate media policy. Her sympathetic testimony to Mr. McCabe would most likely be a problem for prosecutors.
Another important witness who testified before the grand jury, Michael Kortan, the spokesman involved in the episode, could not immediately remember how the leak unfolded.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group, sued in July 2018 for the records related to Mr. McCabe's dismissal. The organization is seeking access to investigators' notes taken during Mr. Kortan's interview, which could be exculpatory to Mr. McCabe, the group's lawyer, Anne Weismann, argued during the hearing.
"We're in dark times," she told the judge, saying that growing evidence showed that Mr. Trump was abusing his powers to go after perceived enemies in the intelligence and law enforcement communities. Mr. McCabe, she said, was "swept up in that."
The judge seemed to acknowledge her point, noting that Mr. Trump was "going after the courts, too." He later added, "I totally appreciate what you just said and share many of the same concerns that you have expressed."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
WASHINGTON -- They came from Ethiopia, Guatemala, Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan. From all over the world, they made the life-changing decision to leave their homes behind and start a new life in America. On Sept. 10, in a packed room in the United States District Court in Washington, they took the final step in the journey to becoming American citizens.
There were 122 immigrants from more than 45 countries who stood before Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and raised their right hands. They took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
I was there, too, and like them I was naturalized as an American.
I am from the small island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, and I had applied for naturalization nearly a year before, on Sept. 28, 2018. Three months later, I was hired as a news assistant in The New York Times's Washington bureau, where I tweet (on the NYT Politics social media handle), fact-check and from time to time write articles on American politics as a reporter and fact checker.
The job followed me through every step of the naturalization process. One day I would be in Manhattan being interviewed by immigration officers, who asked if I had ever been a member of the Communist Party or of the Nazi government of Germany. The next day, the Fourth of July, I covered a brawl between communists and white nationalists over a flag burning in front of the White House.
The growing political extremism that has become apparent in this country did not give me second thoughts about becoming an American. In some ways it made me more committed to the "work of national importance" that I swore at my naturalization ceremony to perform for my country when required.
"America benefits from your citizenship," the judge said to us after we were sworn in. "Because of each of you, and those who have come before you and those who will come after, America will be a stronger and better place."
Despite the words of welcome, there was a sense of relief on the day of naturalization. With citizenship applications receiving more scrutiny than ever -- while being processed at the slowest rate in a decade -- I often wondered if something would go wrong before I took the oath.
That nagging feeling followed me as I watched a sweeping effort to reduce the number of documented and undocumented immigrants entering the United States. A chill fell over me as I transcribed the words "send her back" for reporters as they were chanted by the crowd at a rally for President Trump -- words that were directed at a naturalized American congresswoman.
Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting chief of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, whose signature was on my naturalization certificate, had even said that the lines "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," on the base of the Statue of Liberty, referred to "people coming from Europe."
Mr. Cuccinelli has assumed responsibility for a system of legal immigration whose problems did not start with the Trump administration but have significantly worsened in recent years. It took my family seven years to obtain permanent residency in the United States as a result of being categorized as lower priority, "Family 3rd Preference." But now, seven years is about the average time for all cases, regardless of priority.
In the extreme, some have waited up to 25 years to get a green card. As the backlog in immigration cases increases, some will wait even longer.
The Immigration Act of 1990 sets per-country limits on legal immigration, so the countries with the most applicants have the longest waits. Immigrants from Mexico wait in the longest line of all: No more than 25,620 of the 1.2 million applicants will be granted a green card this year. Today, someone "going to the back of the line," as President Barack Obama put it in 2013, could be waiting 46 years to get an application approved.
Because I was born in Antigua and Barbuda, which had a population of only 80,000 when my family applied, I had much less of a wait. There are more people now applying for green cards in Haiti, with 94,000 applicants in line, than there are people living in my home country.
And I was sponsored by my family, a product of the "chain migration" that Mr. Trump has criticized and vowed to end. Indeed, my "chain" starts seven degrees of sponsorship away, with my father's sister's husband's brother. Looking back at every stage of my journey to becoming an American, the window of opportunity for immigrants appears to be getting smaller and smaller.
And yet, while these efforts have succeeded in turning many away from our teeming shores, my naturalization, and that of others, is a testament to the fact that many more are still coming. Immigrants will continue to pay their life savings, wait in line for years or even decades, and travel across the world for a chance at the American dream.
"No matter where you come from, or what faith you practice, you are now an American citizen," Mr. Trump wrote in a letter all of us received at the naturalization ceremony, which struck some participants as discordant, given how he has described our home countries. But it's true all the same. No matter how difficult you make it for them, immigrants will continue to shape America and participate in its democracy.
I left the courthouse as a hearing in the criminal case of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, was beginning inside. By noon, the president had fired John Bolton, his third national security adviser, a development that would keep reporters and editors alike working well into the evening.
But as I stepped into the office, there was still a moment to celebrate with red, white and blue cookies.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr has held private meetings overseas with foreign intelligence officials seeking their help in a Justice Department inquiry that President Donald Trump hopes will discredit U.S. intelligence agencies’ examination of possible connections between Russia and members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.
And Trump has assisted with Barr’s efforts by calling other countries’ leaders, including the Australian prime minister in a recent phone call.
Justice Department and White House spokesmen, as well as an Australian government spokesman, confirmed and defended the efforts after The Washington Post and The New York Times reported them, citing people familiar with the matter.
Barr’s personal involvement is likely to stoke further criticism from Democrats pursuing impeachment that he is helping the Trump administration use executive branch powers to augment investigations aimed primarily at the president’s adversaries.
But the high-level Justice Department focus on intelligence operatives’ conduct matches Trump’s and conservatives’ "investigate the investigators" rallying cry. Barr has voiced his own concerns, telling lawmakers in April that he believed "spying did occur" when it came to the U.S. investigation of the Trump campaign.
The direct involvement of the nation’s top law enforcement official shows the priority Barr places on the investigation being conducted by John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, who has been assigned the sensitive task of reviewing U.S. intelligence work surrounding the 2016 election and its aftermath.
Current and former intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in re-examining what they view as conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct in the three-year-old election.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec did not name the countries in her statement. But Barr has already made overtures to British intelligence officials, and last week the attorney general traveled to Italy, where he and Durham met senior Italian government officials and Barr asked the Italians to assist Durham, according to one person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue.
It was not Barr’s first trip to Italy to meet intelligence officials, the person said. The Trump administration has made similar requests of Australia, said people who discussed the interactions on the condition of anonymity.
In a recent phone call, Trump urged Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to provide assistance to the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, the people said. Trump made the request at Barr’s urging, they said. The Trump phone call was first reported by The New York Times and later confirmed by an Australian government spokesman who said his government was ready to "help shed further light on the matters under investigation," Bloomberg reported.
Trump administration officials defended the moves as above board.
"I’m old enough to remember when Democrats actually wanted to find out what happened in the 2016 election," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said. "The Democrats clearly don’t want the truth to come out anymore as it might hurt them politically, but this call relates to a DOJ inquiry publicly announced months ago to uncover exactly what happened. The DOJ simply requested the President provide introductions to facilitate that ongoing inquiry, and he did so, that’s all."
Kupec said, "Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries. At Attorney General Barr’s request, the President has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Australian government said it has "always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation. The [prime minister] confirmed this readiness once again in a conversation with the President."
Trump still complains frequently that those involved in the investigation of his campaign should be charged with crimes, asserting the FBI search for possible election season collusion between Russia and Trump campaign officials was a witch hunt spurred by agents and bureaucrats opposed to Trump becoming president. That investigation ended earlier this year when special counsel Robert Mueller determined there was insufficient evidence to charge any Americans with conspiring with Russia and declined to reach a decision about whether the president had sought to obstruct justice.
David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who was involved in the early stages of the Russia probe, said it was "fairly unorthodox for the attorney general personally to be flying around the world as a point person to further evidence-gathering for a specific Justice Department investigation," and especially so in Barr’s case.
Barr’s direct involvement in the effort also helps explain part of the controversial July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A rough transcript of that call shows Trump said he wanted Ukrainian assistance to help find out "what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine," and possible involvement with the Democratic National Committee computer system that U.S. agencies have determined was hacked by Russian intelligence ahead of the 2016 election.
Some of the president’s supporters have suggested Ukraine had a more direct role in the 2016 investigation than currently known, an assertion denied by current and former officials who were involved in the original probe.
A spokesperson for the CIA declined to comment, citing the ongoing review.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation denied that the CIA was involved in monitoring any members of the Trump campaign. Any such operations were conducted by the FBI and were lawful, the former official said, emphasizing that the CIA focused on Russia’s interference in the election, and the role that Russian officials and intelligence agencies played.

Sandford to receive prestigious honor

Texto completo: Before author and Iowan John Sandford could write, he so marveled at his father's book of Grimm's Fairytales and its intricate markings — a secret language known only to adults — that he would scribble backwards, disjointed letters in the blank back pages, hoping his mimicry could be the key to understanding the mysteries that lay between its covers.
Now a New York Times best-selling author of more than 50 books and a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Sandford has since mastered the riddles of the English language, but he's never lost the reverence or wonder for words he discovered that day in the shadow of his dad's book collection.
"It was the great discovery of my life," Sandford said, taking a break from fishing in New Mexico, where he currently lives. "My life has taken some unusual turns, but reading has always been a steady passion, as have libraries."
The Des Moines Public Library Foundation will honor Sandford's zeal and his oeuvre, which includes four series and a handful of fiction and nonfiction one-offs, with the Iowa Author Award during a gala Tuesday.
In a live interview with me, Sandford will discuss some of those "unusual turns" — like how he won a Pulitzer after less than two decades in newspapers — as well as those passions — like how he built a special library to hold his more than 1000-tome art and photography book collection. He'll also detail how he became the principal financial backer of the Beth-Shean Valley Archaeological Project in the Jordan River Valley and where he is in his unending search for the perfect keyboard. (The keys have to have the right "clickiness," he tells me.)
For Sandford, whose given surname is Camp, this award was particularly meaningful because of the monumental role that libraries — whether personal ones like his father's selection or the Cedar Rapids public branches — played in guiding him through life's vicissitudes.
On his first day of kindergarten, the nuns at Sandford's Cedar Rapids Catholic school trotted him and his classroom of nascent learners out to a brightly colored but odd-looking bus he'd soon learn was called a bookmobile.
"They issued all of us kindergarteners library cards, and that meant that we could get books," Sandford said. That moment "was absolutely critical. I'm serious about that; that's not bull----. I'd be a lawyer if there hadn't been libraries."
His love of reading was cemented during the summer before high school when the Cedar Rapids library issued young readers a challenge: Get a figurine for every 10 books you finish. Sandford, an over-achiever in the most classic of senses, plowed through 126 books that season.
"I still remember that I was reading two or three books a day sometimes," he said. "And that's really what made me into a writer."
Sandford became a University of Iowa Hawkeye twice, separating the time between his bachelor's and master's by a stint in the U.S. Army and a year at a small paper in Missouri.
If the bookmobile was the source of his love of reading, his deployment to Korea was the moment he became forever ink-stained. Before getting his number called, his plan was to go to law school, but the army sent him to journalism school and "it was like a perfect fit."
"I loved reporting," he said. "I wanted to be the best possible reporter I could be."
After graduate school, he joined the Miami Herald as a crime and government reporter. Despite a nose for hard news, he always felt the pull of lyrical writing.
"I wanted to be a feature writer, but unfortunately the feature writer, the guy who really kind of had a feature writer slot there nailed down was Carl Hiaasen," Sandford said. "So that was kind of tough competition."
He also felt pulled back to the Middle West, so after about seven years he started looking for a staff writer job up north.
He applied at the Des Moines Register, but "those a—holes" would not hire me, he said with a hearty laugh. Where the Register misstepped, the St. Paul Pioneer Press didn't, hiring him as a feature writer and a columnist.
In 1980, two years into his assignment in Minnesota, Sandford was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for a series on Native American life in the North Star State. Six years later, Sandford won the highest award in journalism for his yearlong dive into the life of an American farm family facing the '80s farm crisis, then the worst agricultural recession since the Depression.
Thinking back on it, the Pulitzer "was sort of like a period for the whole sequence." He had seen that mountaintop and now knew he needed to try a different adventure.
He hadn't ever written personal work on the side, but he readied himself for the long haul that penning a book would be by starting in nonfiction. He wrote a series on plastic surgery for the Pioneer Press that he turned into a book, and he picked up a commission from an Illinois museum for a volume of John Stuart Ingle.
Finally, as the decade switched from the '80s to the '90s, Sandford made the jump, leaving the newspaper world to become a full-time author. He set-up a little office in his home and trained himself to write every day without the pressures of a deadline, and, most importantly, to revise.
"With writing fiction, it helps to be a little bit OCD, because you keep going back and you keep adding stuff and you keep working it," he said, offering that he will revisit the first chapter of a book 30 or 40 times before he feels content with the flow.
As a crime reporter, Sandford had been to his share of gruesome scenes, written about criminal investigations and sat through the tedium of trials.
"When you write a thriller and somebody gets shot, I know what that looks like, and I know what it smells like, and I know what the hospital guys do, and I know what the hospital routine is," he said. "I know what cops talk like; I've been in any number of police stations."
Although he regularly wields old lessons from the newsroom, Sandford, ever the reporter, also puts in good old-fashioned shoe leather when stories call for it. In his newest book, "Bloody Genius," which comes out Tuesday, Sandford visited the real Minneapolis homicide unit to be able to best describe the imitation one he creates in his book.
"I talked to the cops in the homicide unit and so the description that you get there of the Minneapolis City Hall and the Minneapolis Homicide Unit is accurate," he said. "You could go there, and you would see what I wrote."
As with nearly everything in this world, a lot has changed in the crime writing universe since 1990. Cell phones, laptops and the internet have irrevocably altered how crimes are committed and investigated, and DNA advances have made killers less slippery.
"It used to be three (guys) standing around staring at a body with the newspaper reporters standing right behind them," Sandford said. "And now it's guys in white Tyvek suits and booties going into the place because they don't want to disturb the DNA."
But even as the world changes, Sandford's passion remains the same. He's a reader first, a writer very close second and third a lover of studying art, music, history, fishing and the joys of life.
To be as prolific as he is, Sandford doesn't do a lot of book touring or award accepting. But when Iowa came calling, he had to say yes, if only to honor the teen who read 126 books and the nascent gradeschooler amazed by the bookmobile.
And, of course, the tot who wanted so badly to understand the secrets inside Grimm's Fairytales, that he wrote his own in its margins — blissfully unaware those childish markings would set Sandford down a path that has finally led him back home.
